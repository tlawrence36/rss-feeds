      "Domingo Hindoyan will succeed James Conlon as music director of the LA Opera and start a five-year contract on July 1, 2026",
      "NEW YORK -- Domingo Hindoyan will succeed James Conlon as music director of the LA Opera and start a five-year contract on July 1, 2026.",
      "The appointment of the 45-year-old Venezuelan-Armenian, the husband of soprano Sonya Yoncheva, was announced Friday night. Conlon has been music director since 2006-07 and said in March 2024 that he will retire after after the 2025-26 season.",
      "\u201cLA is a city that is known by innovation, taking risks in productions and musically,\u201d Hindoyan said in New York, where his wife is currently singing at the Metropolitan Opera. \u201cThe idea is to do new pieces, commissions and modern pieces, something to really have a balance between what is classic and go further as much as we can.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan will conduct two productions in 2026-27 and three in each of the following four seasons, LA Opera President Christopher Koelsch said. Koelsch hopes Hindoyan can lead works with Yoncheva, who has not sung a staged production at the LA Opera.",
      "Like other companies, the LA Opera has struggled with increased costs following the pandemic and scrapped a planned pair of world premieres over finances. Tenor and conductor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was a key figure in fundraising for the company as general director from 2003-19.",
      "\u201cPart of my job as a music director and the job of any musician is to really take care of the art form as much as we can,\" Hindoyan said, \"not only on stage, not only studying at home (but also) the connection with the community and the connection to the donors.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan was born in Caracas, played violin and is a product of El Sistema, the Venezuelan music education system that was instrumental in the careers of Gustavo Dudamel and Rafael Payare. He was an assistant to Daniel Barenboim at Berlin\u2019s Staatsoper unter den Linden.",
      "\u201cGiven Barenboim's extremely exacting standards, I was impressed that he had that job and held onto that job,\" Koelsch said. \u201cAnd then I saw a performance of 'Tosca' and was kind of immediately struck by the elegance of the baton technique and just the sort of the absolute clarity of what he was conveying.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan has been chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic since the 2021-22 season. He first conducted the LA Opera last November in Gounod\u2019s \u201cRom\u00e9o et Juliette.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a natural warmth and charisma to him. In my experience, he almost always coaxes the best out of people,\" Koelsch said. \u201cThe 'Rom\u00e9o' run for me was kind of a test run of how those qualities resonated inside our building, how it worked with the orchestra and the chorus and the administration and the audiences.\u201d",

      "Al Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer who provided the music for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died at age 84",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Alf Clausen, the Emmy-winning composer whose music provided essential accompaniment for the animated antics of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 27 years, has died.",
      "His daughter Kaarin Clausen told The Associated Press that Alf Clausen died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles after struggling with Parkinson's Disease for about a decade. He was 84.",
      "Clausen, who also scored TV series including \u201cMoonlighting\u201d and \u201cAlf\u201d (\"no relation,\" he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d winning twice.",
      "Al Jean, an early \u201cSimpsons\u201d writer who was one of the key creative figures on the show in the 1990s, said in a post on X Friday that \u201cClausen was an incredibly talented man who did so much for The Simpsons.\"",
      "While Danny Elfman wrote the show's theme song, Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio.",
      "His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show's comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible.",
      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",
      "Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him \u201cone of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.\u201d",
      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

      "WASHINGTON -- One day before the kickoff concert for World Pride 2025 in the nation's capital, headlining performer Shakira has abruptly cancelled due to equipment difficulties.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that unforeseen circumstances have forced the cancellation\u201d of the concert, the Capital Pride Alliance, the main World Pride organizer, said in a Friday statement. \u201cUpdates about the relocated Opening Ceremony program will be released as soon as they are finalized!\u201d",
      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin. A Friday night concert at Fenway for country star Jason Aldean was also cancelled.",
      "\u201cDue to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira\u2019s full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park,\u201d the Capital Pride Alliance statement said. \u201cDespite every effort to make it happen, it is not possible to move forward as planned.\u201d",
      "The Alliance noted that the full slate of citywide events was still on for opening weekend, and said the kickoff ceremony would be relocated and reorganized.",
      "The cancellation presents a further challenge for the Alliance, but at least a non-political one. Organizers have already said they expected international attendance to measurably suffer as a result of concern and anger in the LGBTQ+ community over President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",
      "Some potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year\u2019s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump\u2019s policies. But others have called for a domestic mobilization to flood the capital.",
      "Capital Pride Alliance Executive Director Ryan Bos said that security fencing would be installed surrounding the final two-day concert and rally on a multi-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Early hotel reservation numbers for the final World Pride weekend, June 6-8, were originally down from the previous year, according to Destination D.C., which tracks reservations.",
      "But Destination D.C. President Elliott Ferguson told reporters on Thursday that, \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing now is a surge at the last minute, especially with the national community.\u201d",
      "Ferguson speculated that concerns about international attendance had \u201cgalvanized the local community, the national community to want to come to the city.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The nation's public television service, PBS, has filed suit against President Donald Trump's executive order that it be stripped of federal funding",
      "PBS filed suit Friday against President Donald Trump and other administration officials to block his order stripping federal funding from the 330-station public television system, three days after NPR did the same for its radio network.",
      "In its lawsuit, PBS relies on similar arguments, saying Trump was overstepping his authority and engaging in \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d because of his claim that PBS' news coverage is biased against conservatives.",
      "\u201cPBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d lawyer Z.W. Julius Chen wrote in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cBut regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\u201d",
      "It was the latest of many legal actions taken against the administration for its moves, including several by media organizations impacted by Trump's orders.",
      "PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump's order is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the station, the lawsuit said.",
      "A PBS spokesman said that \u201cafter careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television\u2019s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\u201d",
      "Through an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325 million this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.",
      "PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22% of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS' budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.",
      "Trump's order \u201cwould have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans,\u201d Chen wrote.",
      "PBS said the U.S. Department of Education has canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children's shows like \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d and \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the \u201cLakeland Learns\u201d education program and \u201cLakeland News,\u201d described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather and sports.",
      "Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.",
      "The administration has fought with several media organizations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives, The Associated Press has battled with the White House over press access and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

      "Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "NEW YORK -- Loretta Swit, who won two Emmy Awards playing Major Margaret Houlihan, the demanding head nurse of a behind-the-lines surgical unit during the Korean War on the pioneering hit TV series \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d has died. She was 87.",
      "Publicist Harlan Boll says Swit died Friday at her home in New York City, likely from natural causes.",
      "Swit and Alan Alda were the longest-serving cast members on \u201cM.A.S.H.,\u201d which was based on Robert Altman\u2019s 1970 film, which was itself based on a novel by Richard Hooker, the pseudonym of H. Richard Hornberger.",
      "The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on Feb. 28, 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine put \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d at No. 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No. 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 \u201cfor the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\u201d",
      "In Altman\u2019s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character \u2014 a prickly, rules-bound head nurse who was regularly tormented by male colleagues, who gave her the nickname \u201cHot Lips.\u201d Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.",
      "Sally Kellerman played Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. Her sexuality was played down and she wasn\u2019t even called \u201cHot Lips\u201d in the later years.",
      "The growing awareness of feminism in the \u201970s spurred Houlihan\u2019s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit\u2019s influence on the scriptwriters.",
      "\u201cAround the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\u201d Swit told Suzy Kalter, author of \u201cThe Complete Book of \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTo oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn\u2019t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\u201d",
      "\u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d wasn\u2019t an instant hit. It finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series, but it nabbed nine Emmy nominations. It was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d then TV\u2019s highest-rated show. At the 1974 Emmys, it was crowned best comedy, with Alda winning as best comedy actor.",
      "The series also survived despite cast churn. In addition to Swit and Alda, the first season featured Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff. Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers would later be added, while Jamie Farr and William Christopher had expanded roles.",
      "\u201cLoretta Swit\u2019s portrayal of Margaret \u2018Hot Lips\u2019 Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2014 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy\u2019s most enduring roles. Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion,\" National Comedy Center Executive Director Journey Gunderson said in a statement.",
      "Swit appeared in all but 11 episodes of the series, nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself, exploring issues like PTSD, sexism and racism. Swit pushed for a better representation for women.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I liked, with Loretta\u2019s prodding, was every time I had a chance to write for her character, we\u2019d get away from the Hot Lips angle and find out more about who Margaret was. She became more of a real person,\u201d Alda told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.",
      "The series ended on a happy note for Houlihan, who spends much of the finale debating whether she wants to head to Tokyo or Belgium for her next overseas post. Ultimately she opts to return to America and work at a hospital, citing her father \u2014 a career Army man.",
      "Swit didn\u2019t personally agree that was the correct decision for a military-minded official: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was correct for my Margaret,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2023. \u201cI think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn\u2019t agree with that, but that\u2019s what they wanted her to do.\u201d",
      "But the actor did get to write the speech that Houlihan delivers to her fellow nurses on their final night together, in which she says: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and privilege to have worked with you. And I\u2019m very, very proud to have known you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was consumed with writing that. And I still get letters from women all over the world who became nurses because of Margaret Houlihan. To have contributed to someone\u2019s life like that is remarkable,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment.",
      "During her run, Houlihan had an affair with Hawkeye\u2019s foil, the bumbling Frank Burns, played by Linville in the TV version, and in Season 5, Houlihan returns from a stay in Tokyo engaged to a handsome lieutenant colonel, a storyline that Swit says she advocated for with the writers.",
      "\u201cI told them: \u2018Can you imagine what fun you\u2019re going to have with Larry when I come back to town and I tell him I\u2019m engaged? He\u2019ll rip the doors off of the mess tent!\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they had him do. So we were all of the same mind.\u201d",
      "Toward the end, Swit was tempted to leave the show. She played the role of Chris Cagney in a 1981 television movie, \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d and was offered the part when it was picked up as a midseason series for the spring of 1982. But producers insisted she stay with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d for its last two seasons.",
      "Swit told The Florida Times-Union in 2010 she might have stayed with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but get better as an actor working with scripts like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in something that literate, well, we got spoiled.\u201d",
      "In 2022, James Poniewozik, The New York Times\u2019s chief television critic, looked back on the show and said it held up well: \u201cIts blend of madcap comedy and pitch-dark drama \u2014 the laughs amplifying the serious stakes, and vice versa \u2014 is recognizable in today\u2019s dramedies, from \u2018Better Things\u2019 to \u2018Barry,\u2019 that work in the DMZ between laughter and sadness.\u201d",
      "After the TV series, Swit became a vocal animal welfare activist, selling SwitHeart perfume and her memoir through her official website, with proceeds benefiting various animal-related nonprofit groups.",
      "In 1983, she married actor Dennis Holahan, whom she\u2019d met when he was a guest star on \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d They divorced in 1995.",
      "Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Swit enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, then paid her dues for years in touring productions.",
      "In 1969, she arrived in Hollywood and was soon seen in series such as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible\u201d and \u201cBonanza.\u201d Then in 1972, she got her big break when she was asked to audition for the role of \u201cHot Lips.\u201d",
      "She would regularly return to theater, starring on Broadway in 1975 in \u201cSame Time, Next Year\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\u201d in 1986. She was in \u201cAmorous Crossing,\u201d a romantic comedy, at Alhambra Theatre & Dining in 2010 and in North Carolina Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cMame\u201d in 2003.",

      "The lighthouse appeared overnight",
      "MARSEILLE, France -- The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: \u201cI want to be what you saw in me.\u201d",
      "Banksy had struck again.",
      "On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account \u2014 without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue F\u00e9lix Fr\u00e9gier, in the Catalans district of Marseille\u2019s 7th arrondissement, near the sea.",
      "Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.",
      "There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable \u2014 a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.",
      "The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light \u2014 the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.",
      "Marseille\u2019s mayor, Beno\u00eet Payan, was quick to react online. \u201cMarseille x Banksy,\u201d he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.",
      "Though often political, Banksy\u2019s art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.",
      "The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage.",
      "In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created.",
      "Despite the fame \u2014 or infamy \u2014 at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn\u2019t even know who Banksy was, according to the local press.",
      "On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. More interior.",
      "And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. Another exhibit opens Saturday in Montpellier.",
      "But the Marseille mural wasn\u2019t meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected. No glass shield installed. Just a shadow, a beam and a message that\u2019s already circling the world.",

      "Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child, palace officials confirmed Friday, though they gave no details, saying she is no longer a royal member.",
      "The Imperial Household Agency said both the mother and child are in good health, but did not disclose the baby's date of birth or gender.",
      "The former princess, 33, is a niece of Emperor Naruhito. She married a former college classmate Kei Komuro, a commoner, and renounced her royal status in 2021 as required by Japan's Imperial House Law. Days after their marriage, the couple moved to New York where her husband works as a lawyer.",
      "Officials said that while the birth involved a former royal, the palace decided to publicly confirm the news after media reports earlier this month on the baby's arrival. They added that they hoped Mako would live in a quiet environment.",
      "Mako's parents, Crown Prince Akishino and his wife Kiko, and younger siblings \u2014 Princess Kako and Prince Hisahito \u2014 are delighted and wished Mako's family happiness, officials said.",
      "Japanese tabloid magazine Josei Seven recently published images of Mako and Kei Komuro seen walking with a baby stroller in a neighborhood of New York.",
      "Mako and her husband met at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University. They announced in September 2017 their intention to marry the following year, but the wedding was suspended for four years due to a financial dispute involving Kei Komuro's mother.",
      "Due to the controversy, Mako also declined a dowry to which she was entitled for leaving the imperial family.",
      "Mako\u2019s loss of royal status comes from the Imperial House Law, which allows only male succession.",
      "The rule leaves only Akishino and his son Hisahito in line to succeed Naruhito. A government panel is discussing a more stable succession system, but conservatives reject female succession and only plan to allow female royals to help perform public duties after marriage.",

      "LONDON -- Actor and comedian Russell Brand pleaded not guilty in a London court Friday to rape and sexual assault charges involving four women dating back more than 25 years.",
      "Brand, who turns 50 next week, denied two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault. He said \"not guilty\u201d after each charge was read in Southwark Crown Court.",
      "His trial was scheduled for June 3, 2026 and is expected to last four to five weeks.",
      "Prosecutors said that the offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in London.",
      "Brand didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at court wearing dark sunglasses, a suit jacket, a black collared shirt open below his chest and black jeans. In his right hand, he clutched a copy of the \u201cThe Valley of Vision,\u201d a collection of Puritan prayers.",
      "The \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor known for risqu\u00e9 stand-up routines, battles with drugs and alcohol, has dropped out of the mainstream media in recent years and built a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories, as well as discussing religion.",
      "On a five-minute prayer video he posted Monday on social media, Brand wrote: \u201cJesus, thank you for saving my life.\u201d",
      "When the charges were announced last month, he said that he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cI was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord,\u201d he said in a social media video. \u201cI was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile. But what I never was was a rapist. I\u2019ve never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.\u201d",
      "Brand is accused of raping a woman at a hotel room in Bournemouth when she attended a 1999 Labour Party conference and met him at an event where he was performing.

      "The third accuser was a television employee who met Brand at a birthday party in a bar in 2004, where he allegedly grabbed her breasts before pulling her into a toilet and forcing her to perform oral sex.",
      "The final accuser worked at a radio station and met Brand while he was working on a spin-off of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d reality television program between 2004 and 2005. She said Brand grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before groping her breasts and buttocks.",

      "Big Ocean, the world\u2019s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance \u2014 one beat at a time.",
      "When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity \u2014 vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.",
      "The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, \u201cUnderwater,\u201d which dropped on April 20.",
      "PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.",
      "To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop\u2019s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes \u2014 flashing light guides displayed on monitors \u2014 to help stay in sync when audio alone isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.",
      "\u201cWe each felt rhythm differently when dancing,\u201d PJ told The Associated Press. \u201cSo when we\u2019d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.\u201d",
      "This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. \u201cWhen we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,\u201d said Jiseok. \u201cBut we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation \u2014 just like we practiced.\u201d",
      "Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. \u201cWhen a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can\u2019t see the stage movements in front of us,\u201d PJ said. \u201cOur concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s no clear beat in a song, it\u2019s really hard for us to stay synchronized,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen the bass is overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult for us to catch it accurately.\u201d",
      "Despite these challenges, Big Ocean\u2019s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean\u2019s global fanbase \u2014 known as PADO \u2014 has responded with similar commitment.",
      "\u201cWhile communicating with PADO, we\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen we see how much they\u2019re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.\u201d",
      "The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.",
      "Jiseok credits BTS\u2019s RM with inspiring his musical journey. He said RM\u2019s donation to his former school \u2014 a private institution for deaf and hard of hearing students \u2014 gave him access to music and dance for the first time. \u201cWithout those learning opportunities, I probably never would have dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol,\u201d he said.",
      "Looking ahead, Big Ocean hopes to build on its growing global profile.",
      "\u201cWe recently saw Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram post asking for music collaborators, so we sent him a DM,\u201d PJ said. \u201cAll of us would love the opportunity to work with him. And personally, I\u2019d also love to work with Billie Eilish.\u201d",
      "As the band reflects on its first year, Chanyeon said their biggest growth has been internal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always liked playing it safe \u2014 even with food, I only ate what I was used to,\u201d he said. \u201cBut through Big Ocean, I\u2019ve gained confidence in trying new things. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most satisfied with.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and laid on the floor of an art gallery has once again been packed away following public outcry, 30 years after protests forced the removal of the same artwork.",
      "The Suter Art Gallery in the city of Nelson said Thursday it had taken down the work by M\u0101ori artist Diane Prince due to escalating tensions and safety fears. The episode mirrored an Auckland gallery's removal of the work amid public backlash and complaints to law enforcement in 1995.",
      "This time, the flag was meant to remain on display for five months. Instead, it lasted just 19 days, reigniting long-running debates in New Zealand over artistic expression, national symbols and the country\u2019s colonial history.",
      "Police told The Associated Press on Friday that officers were investigating \u201cseveral\u201d complaints about the exhibition.",
      "The piece, titled Flagging the Future, is a cloth New Zealand flag displayed on the floor with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d stenciled across it. The flag features the British Union Jack and red stars on a blue background.",
      "The work was part of an exhibition, Diane Prince: Activist Artist, and was meant to provoke reflection on the M\u0101ori experience since New Zealand's colonization by Britain in the 19th century. Prince created the piece in 1995 in response to a government policy that limited compensation to M\u0101ori tribes for historical land theft.",
      "\u201cI have no attachment to the New Zealand flag,\u201d Prince told Radio New Zealand in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a New Zealander. I call myself a M\u0101ori.\u201d",
      "Prince couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past has gathered pace in recent decades. But there has been little appetite among successive governments to sever the country\u2019s remaining constitutional ties to Britain or change the flag to a design that doesn't feature the Union Jack.",
      "New Zealand is among countries where desecrating the national flag is considered taboo and prohibited by law. Damaging a flag in public with intent to dishonor it is punishable by a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,984), but prosecutions are fleetingly rare.",
      "As in the United States and elsewhere, the country\u2019s flag is synonymous for some with military service. But for others, particularly some M\u0101ori, it\u2019s a reminder of land dispossession, and loss of culture and identity.",
      "Protests of the artwork in the city of Nelson, population 55,000, included videos posted to social media by a local woman, Ruth Tipu, whose grandfather served in the army\u2019s M\u0101ori Battalion during World War II. In one clip, she is seen lifting the flag from the floor and draping it over another artwork, an action Tipu said she would repeat daily.",
      "A veterans\u2019 group also denounced the piece as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d City council member Tim Skinner said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the work\u2019s inclusion.",
      "But others welcomed it. Nelson\u2019s deputy mayor, Rohan O\u2019Neill-Stevens, posted on social media \u201cin strong defense of artistic expression and the right for us all to be challenged and confronted by art.\u201d",
      "The work was perhaps expected to provoke controversy and in the exhibition\u2019s opening days, The Suter Gallery defended its inclusion. But a statement on its Facebook page late Thursday said a \u201csharp escalation in the tone and nature of the discourse, moving well beyond the bounds of respectful debate\u201d had prompted the flag\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as a judgement on the artwork or the artist\u2019s intent,\u201d the statement said. The gallery didn\u2019t detail specific incidents of concern and a gallery spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview on Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Police said in a statement Friday that while officers were investigating complaints, they weren\u2019t called to any disturbances at the exhibition. Prince said when she revived the work in 2024 that threats of prosecution by law enforcement had prompted its removal from the Auckland gallery in 1995.",

      "As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it",
      "NEW YORK -- As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it.",
      "We should all be so alive and so remembered at his age. Fogerty, in the midst of an international tour, played a rowdy 100-minute set Thursday night to an adoring, near-capacity audience at Manhattan's Beacon Theatre. Crowd members spanned from those likely to remember \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son\u201d and other Creedence Clearwater Revival hits when first released a half-century ago to those looking young enough to have heard about them through their grandparents.",
      "At least from a distance, Fogerty didn't look or sound much different from his prime with Creedence, which was rarely off the charts between 1969 and 1971. He wore his trademark flannel shirt; had the same shaggy haircut, although with his bangs brushed back; sang with a vintage roar that has mellowed only slightly; and even played the same guitar, a Rickenbacker, that he had acquired back in the late '60s.",
      "Fogerty presented himself as a proud rock \u2018n' roller, and a very proud family man. His band includes two of his sons on guitar, Shane and Tyler, with daughter Kelsy briefly joining them on a third guitar. Off to the side was his wife, Julie, whom he praised as the love and the hero of his life, if only because she gave one of the greatest gifts an old rock star could ask for: She helped win back rights to his song catalogue. Fogerty had battled over his copyrights for decades, and at one point found himself being sued for plagiarizing one of his Creedence hits, which at the time he didn\u2019t own.",
      "He has marked his victory with an upcoming album, \u201cLegacy,\u201d for which he recorded new versions of 20 songs. If you were in the house Thursday night, you couldn't help hearing about it. A promotional film about \u201cLegacy\u201d opened the show and Fogerty mentioned it again before his encore set. Both the album, subtitled \u201cThe Creedence Clearwater Revival Years,\u201d and his concert tell a story of how he wants to look back.",
      "As Fogerty noted at one point Thursday night, Creedence Clearwater Revival soared to the highest heights before imploding bitterly in the early \u201870s and never again recording or touring together. Only Creedence diehards would have known the identity of the other band members \u2014 drummer Doug Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John\u2019s brother, who died in 1990. Their names were never mentioned, their faces near-invisible among the rush of images that appeared Thursday on a screen behind Fogerty and his band. The new tracks on \u201cLegacy,\u201d each labeled \u201cJohn's Version,\u201d leave only John Fogerty from the original group.",
      "The Beacon show was very much about where is he now, and how much he likes it. He dashed about the stage, rocked out on his Rickenbacker with the joy of a teenager on air guitar and even poured himself champagne. Fans clapped and danced, while being showered with confetti and dazzled with lasers and fog. The more informed sang along with \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d and the baseball anthem \u201cCenterfield,\" Fogerty's most famous post-Creedence song. Virtually all stood and cheered to serenade the night\u2019s guest of honor, whose birthday was the day before.",

      "The movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint. It's also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, actor Miles Canton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening.",
      "\u201cAnytime that filmmakers take the time out to pay homage to the Delta, especially, because we\u2019re the root of music, the blues culture, that means a lot,\u201d said Brandice Brown Williams, a theater teacher who brought two of her students to the screening.",
      "The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current day Clarksdale doesn\u2019t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown. Community organizers decided to change that, starting a petition to invite the cast and crew to Clarksdale and to collaborate on hosting a public screening.",

      "Trump's status as a \u201ccontent creator\u201d was also damaged by attention given to the interview, lawyers said. It was part of their argument opposing CBS parent Paramount Global's effort to dismiss the president's $20 billion lawsuit against the company, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. Trump has claimed the editing was done to advantage Harris, which CBS rejects.",
      "Even with the effort to dismiss the case, Paramount is engaged in settlement discussions with Trump. The prospect of a settlement has so rattled CBS News that two of its top executives have resigned in protest.",
      "Trump, who did not agree to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\" during the campaign, has protested editing where Harris is seen giving two different answers to a question by the show's Bill Whitaker in separate clips aired on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier in the day. CBS said each reply came within Harris' long-winded answer to Whitaker, but was edited to be more succinct.",
      "Trump's lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, said that \u201cthis led to widespread confusion and mental anguish of consumers, including plaintiffs, regarding a household name of the legacy media apparently deceptively distorting its broadcasts, and then resisting attempts to clear the public record.\u201d",
      "Because they were misled, voters withheld attention from Trump and his Truth Social platform, Paltzik argued.",
      "Trump, described as a \u201cmedia icon\u201d by his lawyers, was \u201cforced to redirect significant time, money and effort to correcting the public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone are seeking the settlement with Trump, whose administration must approve the company's proposed merger with Skydance Media. CBS News' president and CEO, Wendy McMahon, and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who both opposed a settlement, have resigned in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a media advocacy group that says it is a Paramount shareholder, said that it would file a lawsuit in protest if a settlement is reached.",
      "Seth Stern, the foundation's advocacy director, said a settlement of Trump's \u201cmeritless\u201d lawsuit \u201cmay well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system.\u201d U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they are investigating whether a settlement would violate bribery laws.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Paramount has offered $15 million to settle but that Trump wants more money \u2014 and an apology. A company representative would not comment on the report.",

      "Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing have been found in the northern city of Reynosa along the Texas border",
      "CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico -- Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing were found in the northern city of Reynosa, along the Texas border, authorities said on Thursday.",
      "The musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo, which played at parties and local dances in the region, had been reported missing since Sunday.",
      "The genre they played \u2013 Mexican regional music, which encapsulates a wide range of styles including corridos and cumbia \u2013 has in recent years gained a spotlight as it's entered a sort of international musical renaissance. Young artists have mixed the classic genre with trap and sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "While it was not immediately clear if the group played such songs, other artists have faced death threats by cartels, while others have had their visas stripped by the United States under accusations by the Trump administration that they were glorifying criminal violence.",
      "Few details were released about where the bodies were found and in what conditions, but Tamaulipas state prosecutors had been investigating the case, according to a statement by state security officials. The last time they had communicated with their families was Sunday night, when they said they were going to a venue where they were hired to play.",
      "After that, nothing else was heard of them. Officials said the bodies shared characteristics of artists, though did not provide further detail.",
      "Their disappearance caused an uproar in Tamaulipas, a state long eclipsed by cartel warfare. Their families reported the disappearances, called on the public for support and people took to the streets in protest.",
      "On Wednesday, protesters blocked the international bridge connecting Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, later going to a local cathedral to pray and make offerings to the disappeared.",
      "As of midday Thursday, the state prosecutor\u2019s office had not released further details on the case.",
      "Reynosa is a Mexican border city adjacent to the United States and has been plagued by escalating violence since 2017 due to internal disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling and fuel theft.",
      "This case follows another that occurred in 2018, when armed men kidnapped two members of the musical group \u201cLos Norte\u00f1os de R\u00edo Bravo,\u201d whose bodies were later found on the federal highway connecting Reynosa to R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas.",

      "A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge declared Thursday that a man is mentally incompetent to stand trial on charges of stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through her front gate.",
      "The move in a Los Angeles County mental health court came after a second psychiatrist examined the defendant, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, and reached the same conclusion as the first: that his mental health would not allow him to answer to felony charges of vandalism and stalking of the \u201cFriends\u201d star.",
      "\u201cThe court finds the defendant is not currently competent to stand trial,\u201d Judge Maria Cavalluzzi said. \u201cCriminal proceedings will remain suspended.\u201d",
      "Carwyle, 48, of Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty. He appeared behind glass in a custody area of the courtroom and did not speak. He looked vastly different than his previous two court hearings. His scraggly gray hair and beard had been shorn, and he was wearing bright yellow county jail clothing after previously appearing with bare shoulders, wrapped in a blanket-like smock meant for suicide prevention.",
      "Carwyle had argued that he is competent, and exercised his right to a second opinion after an initial incompetence finding last week.",
      "\u201cIt's not the outcome my client would have preferred,\" Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge.",
      "A conviction on the charges, along with an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, could bring up to three years in prison for Carwyle. The incompetence finding has no set end date but it is temporary, and the standard criminal process could resume later.",
      "Cavalluzzi ordered more comprehensive mental evaluations to help determine where and how he'll be held, and what his treatment will be. The judge will get a report on the results at a June 26 hearing, where Aniston or her attorney will be allowed to share her perspective on the case.",
      "Aniston's lawyer, Blair Berk, was in the courtroom observing Thursday, but did not speak. Berk and the deputy district attorney handling the case declined comment outside court.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. Authorities said Aniston was home at the time, but did not come into contact, and no one was injured.",
      "Aniston became one of television's biggest stars in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends,\u201d from 1994 until 2004. She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "It didn't occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201c Karate Kid: Legends,\u201d he'd be the franchise's first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d And that gives him a lot of optimism.",
      "\u201cAt first I didn't even think about that,\u201d Wang told The Associated Press. \u201cThat feels like a very cool and actually privileged position that I get to be in.\"",
      "His casting happened, he said, in \"a world where that's normal enough.\"",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d which opens Friday, unites OG Ralph Macchio's Daniel and Jackie Chan's Mr. Han from the 2010 movie to help Wang's Li Fong win a New York City karate competition.",
      "In the original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d movie, which came out more than 40 years ago, Pat Morita was the only main Asian American cast member even though it takes place in California's San Fernando Valley. His beloved Mr. Miyagi helped underdog Daniel wax on and wax off against white karate bullies. That arc has been replicated and flipped in sequels and offshoots ever since. The overall lack of Asian and Asian American representation all these years has been a lingering point of contention for some.",
      "Jeff Yang, author of \u201cThe Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\u201d said he knows plenty of Asian Americans who find most of the Miyagi-verse entertaining. At the same time, even the recent Netflix \u201cCobra Kai\u201d series hardly had any young Asian American main characters. That lost opportunity felt like a \u201cloose, nagging tooth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a situation where the ancient or legendary martial arts master is transferring his skills not just to another generation, but into another community,\u201d Jeff Yang said. \u201cIn a way, that feels like for me as an Asian American, it turns it into a guilty pleasure.\"",
      "The Asians who were there were \u201ceither sidekicks or villains,\" he added.",
      "In Asia, there's a long cinematic history of elite martial artists-turned-actors ranging from icon Bruce Lee to Chan and Jet Li. But in Hollywood, Asian characters who did perform karate or kung-fu often weren't written three-dimensionally. Most of the stars who could shine for acting and on-screen fighting weren't Asian.",
      "\u201cIn a way that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMartial arts is one of the things that was brought to the United States by soldiers who had been stationed in Asia, learned the practice, embraced the lifestyle and the discipline.\u201d",
      "By the 1970s and '80s, karate dojos were becoming popular all over the U.S. in cities and suburbs. So \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d debuted at just the right time.",
      "Ken Nagayama, a martial arts grand master who runs a school in the Valley, was an instructor at a North Hollywood dojo used for scenes in the original film. He recalls meeting Pat Morita. But, he wasn't thinking about casting. He was impressed by how much interest in karate shot up because of one movie.",
      "\u201cWhen that came out, so many people were interested in taking class, especially younger kids,\u201d said Nagayama, who plans to watch \u201cLegends\u201d with some of his students. He had \u201ca whole mix\u201d of students of all races signing up.",
      "Steven Ho, a stunt coordinator and martial artist who lives in Los Angeles and has appeared multiple times on Conan O'Brien's talk shows, remembers Morita, Macchio and William Zabka watching tournaments he competed in to prepare for the first movie. He was such a fan of Morita that he never thought about how there were no other Asian actors.",
      "\u201cPat Morita, to me, he was the lead,\u201d Ho said. \u201cAlso, if that were the only martial arts film out there, then yeah, it would be odd and I would be disappointed. But you gotta remember the \u201880s and \u201990s we were living in the golden age of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, films that featured ... more authentic martial artists.\"",
      "It's a full-circle moment that Chan is one of the mentors in this new flick. Wang is still in disbelief he got to do combat choreography with the superstar.",
      "\u201cHe's the guy you think he is,\u201d Wang said with a grin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn it off when he\u2019s not on set.\u201d",
      "Ho happily points out that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is reinforcing how his 12-year-old twin sons are growing up without negative Asian stereotypes like he did. He\u2019d rather a story have no Asians if the characters are going to be the butt of the joke. That history of stereotyping of Asian men is why he initially declined appearing on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI thought \u201dOh, he\u2019s a tall guy. I\u2019m a short, Asian guy. They\u2019re just going to goof on me. They\u2019re going to go off on me,' so I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m gonna be out of town,\u2019\u201d Ho said.",
      "Luckily, the segments, which have earned millions of YouTube views, were crafted so Ho was the straight-man to O\u2019Brien\u2019s buffoonery.",
      "Twins Jonny and Ollie, in fact, are real-life karate kids. The boys, known as the \u201cTwinjas,\" know karate, mixed martial arts and other disciplines. They count Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon, as a friend. They've appeared on \u201cAmerica's Got Talent,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\" and taught Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg moves. They love \u201cCobra Kai\u201d for the drama and want to see \u201cLegends\u201d for Chan. They have since been introduced to the movie that started it all.",
      "For Ollie, Miyagi was his favorite character.",
      "\u201cI think that in the first Karate Kids, how the teacher was Asian, I think being a teacher is better than being a student,\u201d he said.",
      "Jonny says not every show or movie in this genre has to have an Asian lead, but when there is one, he takes note.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely a lot of other movies and shows that have Asian leads, like Simu Liu, the first Asian superhero,\u201d Jonny said, referring to Marvel's \u201c Shang-Chi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very significant.\"",
      "The Twinjas, who are working on a children's fiction book that's part mystery and part action, are not shy about voicing their own desire for \u201cany opportunities that come our way, we\u2019d love to take, especially for acting and using our martial arts skills,\u201d Ollie said.",
      "Perhaps they'll get some inspiration from seeing Wang in \u201cLegends.\u201d Wang considers it a \"point of pride\u201d if young Asian American children view him as a benchmark so they can see themselves as the hero.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep going back to is it's a privilege,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat I love about this series is ... there's this idea anyone can be the \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019\u201d",

      "The pardons signed Wednesday are the latest example of Trump, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.",
      "Here are some things to know about the Chrisleys:",
      "\u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which ran from 2014 to 2023, chronicled the extravagant exploits of the boisterous, tightly knit family of the couple and their five children, from high-end cars to luxury vacations to stunning mansions.

      "At trial prosecutors detailed a laundry list of offenses that started before they became famous.",

    "story": [
      "Wes Anderson has always been Wes Anderson, but with \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d he somehow seems more Wes Anderson than ever before",
      "\u201cThey say you murdered my mother,\u201d the young would-be nun tells the shady tycoon. \u201cI feel the need to address this.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s something about the deadpan delivery and the clear-eyed manner that makes you sit up and take notice of Liesl, and even more of Mia Threapleton, who plays her in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d (And there\u2019s another thing, too obvious to ignore: Boy, does she ever resemble her mom, Kate Winslet.)",
      "A vivid presence despite her dry-as-dust tone, Threapleton makes a splendid Andersonian debut here as half the father-daughter duo, along with Benicio Del Toro, that drives the director's latest creation. Their emerging relationship is what stands out amid the familiar Andersonian details: the picture-book aesthetic. The meticulous production design (down to those fascinating closing credits). The chapter cards. The \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Hollywood cameos. And most of all the intricate \u2014 nay, elaborate; nay, labyrinthine \u2014 plot.",
      "Indeed, Anderson seems to be leaning into some of these characteristics here, giving the impression of becoming even more, well, Wes Anderson than before. He will likely delight his most ardent fans but perhaps lose a few others with the plot, which becomes a bit exhausting to follow as we reach the midpoint of this tale.",
      "But what is the Phoenician scheme, anyway?",
      "It's a sweeping, ambitious, somewhat corrupt dream of one Anatole \u201cZsa-zsa\u201d Korda (Del Toro), one of the richest industrialists in Europe, to exploit a vast region of the world. We begin in 1950, with yet another assassination attempt on Korda\u2019s life \u2014 his sixth plane crash, to be exact, which occurs as he sits smoking a cigar and reading about botany.",
      "Suddenly, in a hugely entertaining pre-credits sequence, Korda\u2019s in the cockpit, ejecting his useless pilot and directing his own rescue, asking ground control whether he should crash into a corn or soybean field. The media mourns his passing \u2014 and then he turns up, one eye mangled, biting into a husk of corn. As usual, reports of his death have been \u2026 you know.",
      "Recovering at his estate, with some truly fabulous, tiled bathroom floors, Korda summons Liesl from the convent where he sent her at age 5. He wants her to be his sole heir \u2014 and avenger, should his plentiful enemies get him.",
      "His plans are contained in a series of shoeboxes. But Liesl isn't very interested in the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme. What she wants to know is who killed her mother. She also mentions they haven\u2019t seen each other in six years. (\u201cI apologize,\u201d he says.) And she wonders why none of his nine sons, young boys he keeps in a dormitory, will be heirs. But Korda wants her.",
      "They agree to a trial period. We do get the creeping feeling Liesl will never make it back to the convent \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the red lipstick, or the affinity she\u2019s developing for jewels? But we digress.",
      "We should have mentioned by now the tutor and insect expert, Bj\u00f8rn. In his first Anderson film but likely not the last, Michael Cera inhabits this character with just the right mix of commitment and self-awareness. \u201cI could eat a horse,\u201d he muses in a silly quasi-Norwegian accent before lunch, \u201cand easily a pigeon!\u201d",
      "Now it's on the road they go, to secure investments in the scheme. We won\u2019t get into the financial niceties \u2014 we writers have word-length limits, and you readers have patience limits. But the voyage involves \u2014 obviously! \u2014 a long line of characters only Anderson could bring to life.",
      "Among them: the Sacramento consortium, aka Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston, two American guys who hinge their financial commitment on the outcome of a game of HORSE.",
      "Next it\u2019s to Marseille Bob (Mathieu Amalric), and then to Marty (Jeffrey Wright), leader of the Newark Syndicate (we\u2019re not talking Jersey here, but Upper Eastern Independent Phoenicia), who offers a blood transfusion to Korda because, oh yes, he was shot by terrorists at the previous meeting. (Don't worry, the guy's indestructible.)",
      "Then there\u2019s Cousin Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, continuing the cameo parade), whom Korda seeks to marry to get her participation in the investment.",
      "And then back on the plane, the group is strafed by a fighter jet. Soon, it'll be revealed that one of them is a mole. We won\u2019t tell you who, although it\u2019s hard to tell if anything is really a spoiler here \u2014 like the part when Benedict Cumberbatch appears with a very fake beard as Uncle Nubar, who may be someone\u2019s father or may have killed someone, and engages in a slapstick fight with Korda, complete with vase-smashing.",
      "We also shouldn\u2019t tell you what happens with the big ol\u2019 scheme \u2014 it was all about the journey, anyway. And about Korda and Liesl, who by the end have discovered things about each other but, even more, about themselves.",
      "As for Liesl, at the end, she's clad stylishly in black and white \u2014 but definitely not in a habit. As someone famously said about Maria in \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201csomewhere out there is a lady who I think will never be a nun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a Focus Features release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violent content, bloody images, some sexual material, nude images, and smoking throughout.\u201d Running time: 101 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Hawkins plays a foster mother with a secret in the new horror movie \u201cBring Her Back.\u201d",
      "Beware the quirky foster mother who introduces herself as a bit of a weirdo. That\u2019s how Laura (Sally Hawkins) cheerily greets the newly orphaned teenage siblings Andy and Piper in the new horror \u201cBring Her Back,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday.",
      "The comment, more telling than the kids realize at the time, comes after Laura excitedly introduces Piper, who is non-sighted, to her dog. She thinks it\u2019s a good joke to not explain first that the animal is not alive.",
      "The taxidermy is in fact the least weird thing about Laura. Australian filmmakers Michael and Danny Philippou, also behind the teen chiller debut \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d have dreamed up a new nightmare of trauma, grief, resurrection and the deep failures of Australia\u2019s child protective services. That last part is not actually a prominent throughline in the film, but after witnessing what these kids endure in the brisk 99-minute runtime, you too might have some questions about that department\u2019s standard practices.",
      "Many horror movies and stories have utilized non-seeing characters to enhance the suspense. \u201cBring Her Back\u201d strives to make Piper (newcomer Sora Wong) more than a gimmick but a young woman trying to assert her independence \u2014 she refuses to use her cane, which she thinks makes everyone baby her.",
      "Piper\u2019s main protector is her sweet and attentive older brother Andy (Billy Barratt). The film gives the audience a morsel of normality with these two before plunging us into the horror, first with the sudden death of their father, and then with the strange goings on at Laura\u2019s secluded home.",
      "They\u2019re surprised when they arrive to find there\u2019s another child there as well: Olly (Jonah Wren Phillips), who is mute, deeply strange and, when not locked in his room, getting into bloody messes of his own making. If you\u2019re squeamish about gaping wounds and the full surround sound experience of their squishing and oozing, this might not be the movie for you. For those who delight in the crafts behind it all, the makeup and sound work here is truly top notch.",
      "Like many of \u201cBring Her Back\u2019s\u201d genre peers, the occult, nude older men and grainy VHS tapes also co-star in the proceedings. Laura, whose non-seeing daughter drowned recently, is particularly fixated on Piper and equally as dismissive of poor Andy.",
      "While you can probably guess her endgame, the way it comes together is more of the point, and the Philippou twins certainly infuse the film with a fair amount of foreboding before anything truly deranged starts happening. It\u2019s a fun mystery to watch Laura\u2019s strange behavior, which one eventful day includes encouraging Andy to kiss his dead father on the lips (\"it's custom\"), getting the kids drunk and peeing in a measuring cup.",
      "Andy, three months shy of 18, was not originally supposed to accompany his sister to the foster home. But he convinces the social worker to give him a chance until he can apply for legal guardianship. Unfortunately, Laura seems intent on driving him away. He already has lingering trauma from finding his dead father (and other things that will be revealed in time), and now there\u2019s this chipper, tiny woman ready to gaslight him into insanity. Barratt, who won acclaim for his portrayal of a 12-year-old accused of killing his mother\u2019s boyfriend in the British television film \u201cResponsible Child,\u201d is excellent in a difficult role.",
      "Hawkins, meanwhile, gets to be bigger and wilder with Laura, shedding the nurturing mothers of \u201cPaddington\u201d and \u201cWonka\u201d for something defiantly disturbed. She\u2019s also got a few delightfully chilling lines that I won\u2019t spoil. And yet somehow Hawkins is also able to stay clear of campiness and make Laura, unhinged though she may be, the teeniest bit empathetic.",
      "The film doesn\u2019t quite earn the emotional catharsis it seems to be striving for. It\u2019s a little too insane and also underdeveloped, especially Piper\u2019s character, to let the audience in on that level. But if you\u2019ve come for unexpected scares and creativity, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d will not disappoint.",
      "\u201cBring Her Back,\u201d an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome grisly images, language, graphic nudity, strong violent content, underage drinking). Running time: 99 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

Representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis lawyer Edward Brennan confirmed the settlement-cooperation deal and said Laurinaitis has \u201cevidence\u201d against McMahon and the company, but wouldn't say what it was.",
      "\u201cHis agreement to a confidential settlement is a pivotal next step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable and bringing justice to Ms. Grant after years of sexual abuse and trafficking,\u201d representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis said in a joint statement. \"Mr. Laurinaitis looks forward to moving on with his life. We cannot provide any additional details at this time.\u201d",
      "A court document filed Wednesday says Grant and Laurinaitis agreed to a dismissal of the lawsuit's claims against Laurinaitis, but allegations against the WWE and McMahon remain.",

      "\u201cToday\u2019s dismissal of John Laurinaitis as a defendant doesn\u2019t alter the facts of this case in any way. Vince McMahon never mistreated Janel Grant,\" Rosenberg said. \u201cNo matter how many press releases her team issues, the truth remains unchanged.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg added that a lawyer for Laurinaitis previously said the lawsuit's allegations were unfounded.",
      "Representatives for the WWE did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "Grant sued the WWE, McMahon and Laurinaitis last year in federal court in Connecticut, where the WWE is based in Stamford. In graphic detail, she alleges McMahon coerced her into sex acts with him, Laurinaitis and others, and she claims both men sexually assaulted her. She says she was made to do humiliating acts during the encounters. The lawsuit also includes photos of sexual texts it says McMahon sent Grant.",
      "McMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. He has previously said the lawsuit is \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.",
      "Grant first started working for the WWE in 2019 as an entry-level employee in its legal department, a job arranged by McMahon, and later transferred to the talent relations department, where Laurinaitis was her boss.",
      "Grant has said she was eventually pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.",
      "Currently pending in the lawsuit are motions by McMahon, the WWE and Laurinaitis to move all the claims to arbitration. They said the lawsuit should not be allowed because Grant agreed to settle any disputes in arbitration as part of her nondisclosure agreement.",
      "McMahon resigned from WWE\u2019s parent company in January 2024 after Grant filed her lawsuit. At the time, McMahon stepped down from his position as executive chair of the board of directors at WWE\u2019s parent company, TKO Group Holdings.",
      "McMahon also resigned as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant's lawsuit.",
      "McMahon bought what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1982 and transformed it from a regional wrestling company into a worldwide phenomenon. Besides running the company with his wife, Linda, who is now the U.S. education secretary, he also performed at WWE events as himself.",

According to Nielsen, \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d is among the top 10 most-watched animated kids series on streaming platforms despite not offering new episodes in 10 years.",

      "The creators insisted on using no double entendres, took out mean humor and refused to make the moms and dads idiots. Even the so-called villains \u2014 Candace and Doofenshmirtz \u2014 are good, deep down.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get a laugh, shocking somebody or putting somebody down are the two easiest, cheapest laughs to get,\u201d says Povenmire. \u201cWe\u2019d made this decision to make it nicer than the shows that we had seen on the air at the time.\u201d",
      "The show has been a magnet for celebrity cameos and the upcoming season is no different, with Michael Bubl\u00e9, John Stamos, \u201cTed Lasso\u201d stars Brendan Hunt and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez, Alan Cumming, Leslie Jones, Anna Faris, Megan Rapinoe, Meghan Trainor and Ruth Negga all making guest spots.",
      "Phineas and Ferb's penchant for building things like a submarine sandwich submarine or a vaporizer machine has over the years had an unintended effect \u2014 inspiring a generation of engineers.",
      "When Povenmire visits colleges, engineering students routinely approach to say his TV show was the reason they are studying the field. \u201cSo we\u2019re expecting a thank-you letter from all of the engineering schools around the world,\u201d jokes Marsh.",
      "Marsh recalls the first time he realized that he and Povenmire had a hit on their hands. He was with his child at an outdoor skating rink in Santa Monica early in the show's run when a little girl came skating by, singing their song \u201cS\u2019Winter,\u201d a mashup of summer and winter (One lyric goes: \u201cYou can freeze while you get tan\u201d),",
      "\u201cSo I started singing along with her, and she circles back and sings the entire song and then she looks at me and she goes, \u2018Wow, how do you know that song?\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I watched the show,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cIt was the first time anything I\u2019d written I heard somebody else sing back to me. It was like, \u2019Allright!'\u201d",

      "Matt Berninger's brooding, droning baritone is difficult to separate from The National's alt-rock brand of upbeat electric-guitar escape from minor-key plunges into the life's depths",
      "Matt Berninger's brooding, droning baritone is difficult to separate from The National.",
      "His second solo album, \u201cGet Sunk,\u201d doesn't diverge much from the alt-rock band he's fronted for more than a quarter-century. And why should it?",
      "The National's sad-dad brand exists in the bittersweet spot between Berninger's complex lyrics and a melodic versatility. And \"Get Sunk\u201d sounds more like an extension of the band's catalog than a self-serving experiment for a restless songwriter.",
      "It works on both levels \u2014 with the album's familiar, upbeat electric guitar-escapes.",
      "But when compared to his band's repertoire, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d runs out of steam. Even with his consistently clever lyrics, a couple of lethargic songs can drag down a 10-track lineup.",
      "The record arrives a few years after a struggle with pandemic-driven depression, as he detailed in an interview with David Letterman. Berninger was hit by a bad case of writer\u2019s block after his first solo record, \u201cSerpentine Prison,\u201d came out in 2020.",
      "The National\u2019s release of two new albums five months apart in 2023, after a four-year hiatus, helped thaw some of Berninger's frozen creativity. His family moved from California to Connecticut that year, too, further aiding his reset; he began reading and painting in the fresh air.",
      "On \u201cGet Sunk,\" the third track, \u201cBonnet of Pins,\u201d brings a hard edge, evoking the band's \u201cThe System Only Dreams in Total Darkness\u201d record from 2017. \u201cGet Sunk\u201d producer Sean O'Brien cranks on the guitar. Drummer Sterling Laws does his best impression of The National stalwart Bryan Devendorf. Julia Laws, whose indie rock band Ronboy has been touring with Berninger, sings backup on this smoky, stressful encounter with an ex-lover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cup trick shell game, it\u2019s a puff of smoke/And it gets me every time, it\u2019s a pretty good joke,\u201d Berninger sings. \u201cI know that you miss me, I know that you miss me/This stuff takes a lifetime.\u201d",
      "With the infectious opener \u201cInland Ocean\u201d bursting with a reverbed guitar that pulsates throughout the song, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d gets revved up right away. Even on the downbeat \u201cNowhere Special,\" Berninger is at his songwriting best ambling through a rant about an on-again, off-again relationship: \u201cA bat can haul our recording equipment into the woods/I know we shouldn\u2019t but I feel like we should.\u201d The closer, \u201cTimes of Difficulty,\u201d is tailor-made for a live-show singalong with the chant \u201cGet drunk! Get sunk! Forget! Get wet!\u201d that marks Berninger's search for clarity and creativity.",
      "Much like The National's 2019 album \u201cI Am Easy to Find,\u201d which brought in several women to pair vocals with his gravelly baritone, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d follows suit. Laws sings on eight of the 10 tracks, and Meg Duffy of the band Hand Habits joins Berninger on the sentimental \u201cFrozen Oranges.\"",
      "The sleepiness of \u201cFrozen Oranges\u201d is also the first warning there's just not enough energy to cover a whole album, not quite enough strength for \u201cGet Sunk\u201d to swim on its own. Berninger will be forever intertwined with The National, a connection there's no need to undo.",

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "A leading medical group is warning of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country",
      "CAIRO -- A leading medical group warned on Tuesday of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country, and said its teams have treated hundreds of patients in the region of the capital, Khartoum.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",
      "Activists have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",
      "French religious leaders this month issued a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the dangers of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",

Each French movie averaged nearly three minutes of on-screen smoking, effectively the same exposure as six 30-second television ads.",
      "Cinema has been particularly influential. Belmondo\u2019s rebellious smoker in Jean-Luc Godard \u2019s \u201cBreathless\u201d became shorthand for youthful defiance worldwide. Bardot\u2019s cigarette smoke wafted through \u201cAnd God Created Woman,\u201d symbolizing unbridled sensuality.",

Air France did not ban smoking on all its flights until 2000, years after major U.S. carriers began phasing it out in the late 1980s and early \u201990s. The delay reflected a country slower to sever its cultural romance with cigarettes, even at 35,000 feet.",
      "Strolling through the stylish streets of Le Marais, the trendiest neighborhood in Paris, reactions to the smoking ban ranged from pragmatic acceptance to nostalgic defiance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about time. I don\u2019t want my kids growing up thinking smoke is romantic,\u201d said Cl\u00e9mence Laurent, a 34-year-old fashion buyer, sipping espresso at a crowded caf\u00e9 terrace. \u201cSure, Bardot made cigarettes seem glamorous. But Bardot didn\u2019t worry about today's warnings on lung cancer.\u201d",
      "At a nearby boutique, vintage dealer Luc Baudry, 53, saw the ban as an attack on something essentially French. \u201cSmoking has always been part of our culture. Take away cigarettes and what do we have left? Kale smoothies?\u201d he scoffed.",
      "Across from him, 72-year-old Jeanne L\u00e9vy chuckled throatily, her voice deeply etched \u2014 she said \u2014 by decades of Gauloises. \u201cI smoked my first cigarette watching Jeanne Moreau,\u201d she confessed, eyes twinkling behind vintage sunglasses. \u201cIt was her voice \u2014 smoky, sexy, lived-in. Who didn\u2019t want that voice?\u201d",
      "Indeed, Jeanne Moreau\u2019s gravelly, nicotine-scraped voice transformed tobacco into poetry itself, immortalized in classics such as Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cJules et Jim.\u201d Smoking acquired an existential glamour that made quitting unimaginable for generations of French smokers.",
      "France\u2019s new law mirrors broader European trends. Britain, Spain and Sweden have all implemented significant smoking bans in public spaces. Sweden outlawed smoking in outdoor restaurant terraces, bus stops and schoolyards back in 2019. Spain extended its bans to caf\u00e9 terraces, spaces still exempt in France\u2014at least for now.",
      "In the Paris park Place des Vosges, literature student Thomas Bouchard clutched an electronic cigarette that is still exempt from the new ban and shrugged.",
      "\u201cMaybe vaping\u2019s our compromise,\u201d he said, exhaling gently. \u201cA little less sexy, perhaps. But fewer wrinkles too.\u201d",

      "More than two dozen people were trapped in the rubble when the Gunung Kuda quarry in Cirebon district collapsed on Friday. Rescuers pulled a dozen injured people and 10 bodies from the debris during a grueling search effort.",
      "They retrieved three more bodies late Friday, and another worker died in hospital, bringing the death toll to 14, said the National Search and Rescue Agency in a statement. Five people have been hospitalized with serious injuries.",
      "Local television reports showed emergency personnel, along with police, soldiers and volunteers digging desperately in the quarry in a steep limestone cliff, supported by five excavators, early Saturday.",
      "Authorities said six to eight people are still believed to be trapped.",
      "The cause of the collapse is still under investigation, and police have been questioning six people including the owner of the quarry, said local police chief Sumarni.",

      "It comes after the U.S. State Department has revoked visas of a number of Mexican musicians for playing a genre of music that it says glorifies cartel violence.",
      "The group, which has soared to international fame playing Mexican regional music, said in a statement posted on its Instagram account that the visas of them and their team are currently under \u201cadministrative review by the U.S. Embassy\" and that it would make it \u201cimpossible\u201d for them to perform in the La Onda Fest to be held in the city of Napa Valley, California on June 1. But the post didn't detail what it would mean in the long term for the musical group.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Mexico said that visa cases are confidential according to U.S. law and couldn't provide more information on the case.",
      "The suspension is just the latest in a series of moves the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has taken targeting Mexican artists in the genre, who in some cases have glorified the leaders of cartels as sort of Robin Hood figures. While the genre of \u201cnarco-corridos\u201d has stirred controversy, much of the music also speaks to the harsh realities facing Mexican youth caught in cartel violence.",

In March 2023, Panama\u2019s Congress reached an agreement with First Quantum, allowing subsidiary Panama Copper to continue operating the mine in a biodiverse jungle on the Atlantic coast west of the capital for at least 20 more years.",

      "Later, she was taken to a room on the local military base where she said soldiers raped her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take it. My whole body hurt,\u201d Ixtap\u00e1 said. She got pregnant, aborted and wasn\u2019t able to have children. Tum Ram\u00edrez was convicted of raping two women and for signaling four women to be raped by others.",

      "The sculpture shows Stalin surrounded by beaming workers and children with flowers. It was installed at the Taganskaya station to mark the 90th anniversary of the Moscow Metro, the sprawling subway known for its mosaics, chandeliers and other ornate decorations that was built under Stalin.",
      "It replaces an earlier tribute that was removed in the decade following Stalin's 1953 death in a drive to root out his \u201ccult of personality\u201d and reckon with decades of repression marked by show trials, nighttime arrests and millions killed or thrown into prison camps as \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d",
      "Muscovites have given differing responses to the unveiling earlier this month, with some recalling how the country lived in fear under his rule. Many commuters took photos of the monument and some laid flowers beneath it.",
      "Aleksei Zavatsin, 22, told The Associated Press that Stalin was a \u201cgreat man\" who had \u201cmade a poor country into a superpower.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe raised the country from its knees,\u201d he said.",
      "Activists from Society.Future, a Russian political movement that voices pro-democratic and nationalist views, protested by placing posters at the foot of the monument that quoted top politicians condemning the dictator.",
      "One poster, featuring President Vladimir Putin, cited him as bemoaning Stalin's \u201cmass crimes against the people,\" and saying his modernization of the USSR came at the price of \u201cunacceptable\u201d repression.",
      "The unveiling came weeks after Putin signed a decree renaming the airport in Volgograd as Stalingrad \u2014 as the city was called when the Soviet Red Army defeated Nazi German forces there in one of the bloodiest battles of World War II.",
      "Volgograd itself briefly reverted to its former name on May 8-9 for Victory Day celebrations and will be temporarily renamed five more times this year to mark related wartime anniversaries.",
      "Putin has invoked the Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted five months and saw up to 2 million soldiers and civilians killed, as justification for Moscow's actions in Ukraine.",
      "Russian political analyst Pyotr Miloserdov said the Kremlin has used a broader drive to embrace Stalin's legacy to justify both the conflict in Ukraine and crackdown on dissent at home.",
      "\u201cStalin was a tyrant, a despot, and that\u2019s what we need,\" he told AP. Authorities want to revive Stalin's image to popularize the idea of strongman rule, he added, and paint violence and repression as justified under extraordinary circumstances.",
      "\u201cThis can lead to justifying any senseless, forceful actions. Under Stalin, this was allowed, there was a war. ... So, here is our special military operation, and now this is allowed too. This is simply an attempt to justify the use of force on people,\" Miloserdov said.",

      "For months, experts have warned that Palestinians in Gaza are on the brink of famine",
      "For months, U.N. officials, aid groups and experts have warned that Palestinians in Gaza are on the brink of famine.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel eased a weekslong blockade on the territory as a result of international criticism, but the U.N. humanitarian aid office said Friday that deliveries into Gaza remain severely restricted, describing the current flow of food as a trickle into an area facing catastrophic levels of hunger.",
      "Gaza\u2019s population of more than 2 million people relies almost entirely on outside aid to survive because Israel\u2019s 19-month-old military offensive has wiped out most capacity to produce food inside the territory.",
      "Israel said it imposed the blockade to pressure Hamas into releasing the hostages it holds and because it accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid, without providing evidence. The U.N. says there are mechanisms in place that prevent any significant diversion of aid, though aid trucks have been robbed and hungry crowds have broken into aid warehouses a few times.",
      "No famine has been formally declared in Gaza.",
      "Here's a look at what famine means and how the world finds out when one exists.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on hunger crises, considers an area to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially are starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they\u2019re too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.",
      "Famine can appear in pockets \u2014 sometimes small ones \u2014 and a formal classification requires caution.",
      "Last year, experts said a famine was ongoing in parts of North Darfur in Sudan. Somalia, in 2011, and South Sudan, in 2017, also saw famines in which tens of thousands of people were affected.",
      "Gaza poses a particular complication for experts since access is severely limited, making gathering data difficult if not impossible in some cases.",
      "Last year, the IPC said an area can be classified as in \u201cfamine with reasonable evidence\u201d if two of the three thresholds have been reached and crossing the third appears likely to have happened.",
      "The IPC unites experts from more than 20 organizations like the U.N.\u2019s health, development, and food aid agencies; charity CARE International; the Famine Early Warning Systems Network; and the European Union and the World Bank.",
      "The short answer is, there\u2019s no set rule.",
      "While the IPC says it is the \u201cprimary mechanism\u201d used by the international community to analyze data and conclude whether a famine is happening or projected, it typically doesn\u2019t make such a declaration itself.",
      "Often, U.N. officials or governments will make a formal statement, based on an analysis from the IPC.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread misunderstanding that someone has to declare a famine before it is a famine. That is not the case,\u201d said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \u201cWhen IPC shows the data that hits the threshold for a famine, then it\u2019s a famine.\u201d",
      "Theoretically, governments and the international aid community, including the United Nations, unlock aid and funding to help feed people en masse.",
      "A small amount of food is entering Gaza again following the 2 1/2-month Israeli blockade. But aid groups say it is a fraction of what is needed \u2014 and gunfire and chaos have plagued food distribution in recent days.",
      "The Israeli military says it has facilitated the entry of nearly 1,000 trucks the past 12 days, far below the rate even at the highest times during the war when several hundred trucks a day would enter.",
      "In general, international preparation and effective deployment in response to famines can be lacking.",
      "\u201cThere is not a big, huge bank account\u201d to draw on, said OCHA\u2019s Laerke. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that we build the fire engine as we respond.\"",

      "Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has won a libel suit against BBC over a claim he authorized the killing of an informant",
      "LONDON -- Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams won his libel suit against the BBC on Friday over a claim that he authorized the killing of an informant inside the Irish republican movement.",
      "A jury at the High Court in Dublin ruled in Adams\u2019 favor and awarded him 100,000 euros ($113,000) in damages. Jurors deliberated for just under seven hours after the monthlong trial before reaching a verdict, rejecting the BBC's argument that it had acted in good faith and in a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d way.",
      "Adams sued Britain\u2019s public broadcaster over a claim in a decade-old documentary and online article that he sanctioned the killing of Denis Donaldson, a long-serving Sinn Fein official who acknowledged in 2005 that he had worked for British intelligence. He was shot dead at his cottage in rural Ireland four months later.",
      "In the BBC program broadcast in September 2016, an anonymous source claimed the shooting was sanctioned by the political and military leadership of the IRA and that Adams gave \u201cthe final say.\u201d",
      "Adams denies involvement and called the allegation a \u201cgrievous smear.\u201d",
      "Adams, 76, is one of the most influential figures of Northern Ireland\u2019s decades of conflict, and its peace process. He led Sinn Fein, the party linked to the Irish Republican Army, between 1983 and 2018. He has always denied being an IRA member, though former colleagues have said he was one of its leaders.",
      "Around 3,600 people were killed in \u201cthe Troubles,\u201d Northern Ireland's three decades of violence involving Irish republican and British loyalist militants and U.K. soldiers. The IRA stopped fighting and disarmed after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended the violence, though small splinter groups opposed to the peace process continued to mount occasional attacks.",
      "A splinter group known as the Real IRA claimed responsibility in 2009 for killing Donaldson. An Irish police investigation remains ongoing.",
      "Adams' lawyer, Paul Tweed, said outside court that his client was \u201crelieved and satisfied\u201d that jurors had reached \u201cthe unequivocal conclusion that the subject allegation was highly defamatory.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the BBC argued that the documentary didn't claim that Adams had sanctioned murder, merely putting that forward as an allegation alongside Adams\u2019 denial. They also argued the program didn't harm Adams' reputation, because he was widely considered to have been an IRA commander and so had little reputation to lose.",
      "Speaking after the ruling, Adams said \"I\u2019ve always been satisfied with my reputation.",
      "\u201cObviously, like yourself, we all have flaws in our character, but the jury made the decision and let\u2019s accept the outcome, and I think let\u2019s accept what the jury said,\" he said.",

      "Federal health officials say at least 45 people in 18 states have been sickened in an expanding salmonella outbreak tied to recalled cucumbers",
      "Nearly four dozen people in 18 states have been sickened in an expanding outbreak of salmonella food poisoning tied to recalled cucumbers sent to restaurants, hospitals, cruise ships and grocery stores, including Target stores, federal health officials said Friday.",
      "At least 16 people have been hospitalized after eating cucumbers produced by Florida-based Bedner Growers and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The cucumbers were sold from April 29 through May 19.",
      "The outbreak includes reports of illness from people aboard six different cruise ships that departed from U.S. ports between late March and mid-April, the CDC said. The true number of sick people is likely much higher and the outbreak could affect additional states, officials said.",
      "Several companies have issued recalls for whole cucumbers and cucumbers used in a range of sandwiches, salsas and other foods linked to the outbreak. Target recalled dozens of products, including whole cucumbers, salads and vegetable rolls.",
      "The outbreak was detected during a follow-up inspection in April to a 2024 outbreak that sickened 551 people and led to 155 hospitalizations in 34 states and Washington, D.C. In that outbreak, investigators found salmonella bacteria linked to many of the illnesses in untreated canal water used at farms operated by Bedner Growers and Thomas Produce Company.",
      "As part of the new investigation, FDA officials found salmonella in a sample of Bedner Growers cucumbers at a distribution center in Pennsylvania. That sample matched the strain of salmonella that made people sick. In addition, \u201cmultiple other strains\u201d of salmonella were detected that match samples in a government database. CDC officials are working to determine whether additional illnesses in people match those strains.",
      "Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, severe vomiting, dehydration and stomach cramps. Most people who get sick recover within a week. Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",

      "Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has vetoed a bill that would have made Colorado the first state to ban landlords from using rent-setting algorithms",
      "Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has vetoed a bill that would have made Colorado the first state to ban landlords from using rent-setting algorithms, which many advocates have blamed for driving up housing costs across the country.",
      "RealPage is the target of a federal lawsuit filed last year that accuses the real estate software company of facilitating an illegal scheme to help landlords coordinate to hike rental prices. Eight other states, including Colorado, have joined the Department of Justice's lawsuit, though RealPage has vehemently denied any claims of collusion and has fought to have the lawsuit dismissed.",
      "Critics say RealPage software combines confidential information from each real estate management company in ways that enable landlords to align prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents. RealPage\u2019s clients include huge landlords who collectively oversee millions of units across the U.S.",
      "The Colorado bill, which recently passed the Democratic-led Legislature along party lines, would have prevented the use of such algorithms.",
      "In a veto letter Thursday, Polis said he understands the intent of the bill but that any collusion among landlords would already violate existing law.",
      "\u201cReducing market friction through legitimate means that do not entail collusion is good for both renters and landlords,\u201d Polis wrote. \u201cWe should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing.\u201d",
      "In a statement, RealPage applauded Polis' veto, calling it an example of \u201ccourageous leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,\u201d said Jennifer Bowcock, a spokesperson for the Texas-based firm.",
      "But Polis' decision outraged local housing advocates and the American Economic Liberties Project, a consumer rights advocacy group that has helped lead the fight against RealPage and other companies that use rent-setting algorithms.",
      "\u201cThis veto sends the devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from people who have the least,\u201d said Sam Gilman, co-founder and president of the Community Economic Defense Project, a Colorado-based nonprofit.",
      "RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage's clients charge the highest possible rent.",
      "Although Colorado was the first state to pass a bill targeting rental algorithms, at least six cities have passed similar ordinances over the past year. They include Philadelphia; Minneapolis; San Francisco; Berkeley, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "RealPage has decried those measures and sued over Berkeley's ordinance, saying it violates the company\u2019s free speech rights and is the result of an \u201cintentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims\u201d about its products.",
      "RealPage argues that the real driver of high rents is a lack of housing supply. It also says that its pricing recommendations often encourage landlords to drop rents since landlords are incentivized to maximize revenue and maintain high occupancy.",
      "A clause recently added to Republicans\u2019 signature \u201c big, beautiful \u201d tax bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. On Tuesday, five Democratic senators sent a letter to RealPage asking if the company was involved in getting that clause inserted.",
      "In an email, Bowcock said RealPage was not involved in the AI moratorium language, but she said the company supports \u201ca thoughtful, well-grounded, and consistent regulatory approach to AI, rather than a patchwork of state and local legislation.\u201d",

      "The New York Mets are hiring U.S. Tennis Association CEO Lew Sherr as their new president of business operations",
      "PARIS -- The New York Mets are hiring the person who oversees the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Lew Sherr, as their new president of business operations.",
      "Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. His departure was announced by the USTA on Friday; he will remain there until the end of June, then start with the Mets in July.",
      "\u201cFor right now, my focus is the smoothest possible transition,\u201d Sherr said in an interview with The Associated Press at the French Open. \u201cBut I'm hugely excited about what's happening over there. (Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. You see it on the field, off the field. The energy around the team. The energy around what they\u2019re trying to do for the community with their foundation. The plans for the casino and the hotel and entertainment district.\u201d",
      "Steve Cohen is among the bidders for three casino licenses to be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission and has been lobbying to have the state legislature reclassify the parking lots adjacent to Citi Field \u2014 also near the facility that hosts the U.S. Open \u2014 from parkland to commercial land for a gaming facility.",
      "The Mets announced Scott Havens' departure as their president of business operations on Tuesday; he was in that post since December 2023. Chief legal officer Katie Pothier, chief marketing officer Andy Goldberg, chief communications officer Nancy Elder and senior vice president of finance Peter Woll have left since November.",
      "The USTA said Brian Vahaly and Andrea Hirsch will be interim co-CEOs during a search for Sherr's replacement. Vahaly is chairman of the USTA Board; Hirsch is the USTA's chief operating officer and chief legal officer.",
      "In Sherr's time as CEO, the USTA has seen growth in tennis participation around the country, along with increases in U.S. Open attendance, sponsorships, and revenue from ticket sales and broadcasting rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve taken some big swings,\" Sherr said Friday, \u201cand thankfully, they\u2019re paying off.\u201d",
      "Just last week, he spoke at a news conference in New York to unveil an $800 million project to update Arthur Ashe Stadium and create a player performance center on the tournament grounds. He also made significant changes to this year's U.S. Open mixed doubles event in a bid to attract top singles players, making it a two-day, 16-team competition the week before the singles brackets begin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet, in that I really have loved being part of this organization for 15 years and the opportunities I've had to do just really interesting things \u2014 and not just on the commercial side, but in terms of helping us think about growing the sport,\u201d Sherr said. \"I\u2019m leaving sleeping well at night, knowing (the USTA) is going to be well looked-after.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a draft analysis of the environmental effects of building a protective tunnel around an aging Enbridge oil pipeline running beneath a channel connecting two Great Lakes",
      "Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.",
      "The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.",
      "With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.",
      "Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.",
      "The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.",
      "Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.",
      "Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.",
      "The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.",
      "Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,\u201d Enbridge officials said in a statement.",
      "The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains \u201can existential threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cChances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes \u2014 our most valuable freshwater resource \u2014 skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.\u201d",
      "Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.",
      "\u201cMy key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,\" she said.",
      "Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.",
      "Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.",
      "Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.",
      "Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.",
      "A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.",
      "About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa\u2019s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it\u2019s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",

The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would stop Aldi from selling products that infringe on its trademarks.",
      "A message seeking comment was left Thursday with Aldi.",
      "In the lawsuit, Mondelez displayed side-by-side photos of multiple products. Aldi\u2019s Thin Wheat crackers, for example, come in a gold box very similar to Mondelez's Wheat Thins. Aldi\u2019s chocolate sandwich cookies and Oreos both have blue packaging. The supermarket's Golden Round crackers and Mondelez\u2019s Ritz crackers are packaged in red boxes.",
      "Aldi, a German discount chain with U.S. headquarters in Batavia, Illinois, keeps prices low by primarily selling products under its own labels.",
      "The chain has faced lawsuits over its packaging before. Last year, an Australian court found that Aldi infringed on the copyright of Baby Bellies snack puffs for young children. In that case, Aldi's packaging featured a cartoon owl and similar colors to the name-brand packaging.",
      "Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",
      "Mondelez said in its lawsuit that the company had contacted Aldi on numerous occasions about \u201cconfusingly similar packaging.\u201d Mondelez said Aldi discontinued or changed the packaging on some items but continued to sell others.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that Aldi infringed on Mondalez's trade dress rights for the packaging of Nutter Butter and Nilla Wafers cookies, and its Premium cracker brand.",

      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",
      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump\u2019s tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "TOKYO -- Asian shares were mostly lower Friday as uncertainty grew about what will happen next after a U.S. court blocked  many of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs.",
      "Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.1% in afternoon trading to 38,022.62. Government data showed Tokyo core inflation, excluding fresh food, rising to a higher-than-expected 3.6% in May. Some analysts say that makes it more likely the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates.",
      "Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,436.30. South Korea's Kospi declined 0.9% to 2,696.40, ahead of a presidential election set for next week.",

      "It\u2019s a downshift after stocks initially leaped nearly 2% in Tokyo and Seoul, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling late Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade. The court said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive  increases in taxes on imports from around the world  does not authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "The ruling at first raised hopes in financial markets that a hamstrung Trump would not be able to drive the economy into a recession with his tariffs, which had threatened to grind down on global trade and raise prices for consumers already sick of high inflation.",
      "But the tariffs remain in place for now while the White House appeals the ruling, and the ultimate outcome is still uncertain. The court\u2019s ruling also affects only some of Trump\u2019s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.",
      "The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Thursday allowed the president to temporarily continue collecting the tariffs under the emergency powers law while he appeals the trade court\u2019s decision.",

      "President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday to celebrate a details-to-come deal for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday to celebrate a details-to-come deal for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, which he says will keep the iconic American steelmaker under U.S.-control.",
      "Though Trump initially vowed to block the Japanese steelmaker\u2019s bid to buy Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, he changed course and announced an agreement last week for what he described as \u201cpartial ownership\u201d by Nippon. It's not clear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalized or how ownership would be structured.",
      "Trump stressed the deal would maintain American control of the storied company, which is seen as both a political symbol and an important matter for the country\u2019s supply chain, industries like auto manufacturing and national security.",
      "Trump, who has been eager to strike deals and announce new investments in the U.S. since retaking the White House, is also trying to satisfy voters, including blue-collar workers, who elected him as he called to protect U.S. manufacturing.",
      "U.S. Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed \u201cpartnership\u201d but also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.",
      "State and federal lawmakers who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy U.S. Steel and spend billions on U.S. Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government\u2019s veto power in the form of a \u201cgolden share.\u201d",
      "In the absence of clear details or affirmation from the companies involved, the United Steelworkers union, which has long opposed the deal, this week questioned whether the new arrangement makes \u201cany meaningful change\u201d from the initial proposal.",
      "\u201cNippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel\u2019s facilities if it owned the company outright,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.\u201d",
      "The White House did not offer any new details Thursday. U.S. Steel did not respond to messages seeking information. Nippon Steel also declined to comment.",
      "No matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign to make the revitalization of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of U.S. Steel, once the world\u2019s largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.",
      "Trump said Sunday he wouldn\u2019t approve the deal if U.S. Steel did not remain under U.S. control and said it will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.",
      "In an interview on Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Dan Meuser called the arrangement \u201cstrictly an investment, a strategic partnership where it\u2019s American-owned, American run and remains in America.\u201d",
      "However, Meuser said he hadn\u2019t seen the deal and added that \"it\u2019s still being structured.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick came out in favor of the plan, calling it \u201cgreat\u201d for the domestic steel industry, Pennsylvania, national security and U.S. Steel\u2019s employees. A bipartisan group of senators, joined by then-Senate candidate McCormick, had opposed Nippon Steel\u2019s initial proposed purchase of U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion after it was announced in late 2023.",
      "In recent days, Trump and other American officials began touting Nippon Steel\u2019s new commitment to invest $14 billion on top of its $14.9 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the U.S.",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s other senator, Democrat John Fetterman \u2014 who lives across the street from U.S. Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Steel Works blast furnace \u2014 didn\u2019t explicitly endorse the new proposal. But he said he had helped jam up Nippon Steel\u2019s original bid until \u201cNippon coughed up an extra $14B.\u201d",
      "The planned \u201cgolden share\u201d for the U.S. amounts to three board members approved by the U.S. government, which will essentially ensure that U.S. Steel can only make decisions that\u2019ll be in the best interests of the United States, McCormick said Tuesday on Fox News.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, had largely refrained from publicly endorsing a deal but said at a news conference this week that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the arrangement.",
      "In an interview published Thursday in the conservative Washington Examiner, Shapiro said: \u201cThe deal has gotten better. The prospects for the future of steelmaking have gotten better.\u201d",
      "Chris Kelly, the mayor of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel\u2019s Irvin finishing plant is located, said he was \u201cecstatic\u201d about the deal, though he acknowledged some details were unknown. He said it will save thousands of jobs for his community.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a reprieve from taking steel out of Pittsburgh,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. Justice Department has formally moved to dismiss a criminal fraud charge against Boeing and asked a judge to cancel an upcoming trial connected to two plane crashes that killed 346 people",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Justice Department has formally moved to dismiss a criminal fraud charge against Boeing and has asked a judge to cancel an upcoming trial connected to two plane crashes that killed 346 people off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia, according to court documents filed Thursday.",
      "The deal, announced last week, will allow the American aircraft manufacturer to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before the planes crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019.",
      "The \u201cagreement in principle\u201d will require the company to pay and invest more than $1.1 billion, including an additional $445 million for the crash victims\u2019 families, in return for dismissing the criminal case, according to court documents. Dismissing the fraud charge will allow the manufacturer to avoid a possible criminal conviction that could have jeopardized the company\u2019s status as a federal contractor, experts have said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, will decide whether to accept the motion to dismiss, accept the terms of the non-prosecution agreement and whether to cancel the trial. O\u2019Connor on Thursday ordered all the lawyers to present him with a briefing schedule on the government\u2019s motion by June 4.",
      "Some relatives of the passengers who died in the crashes have been pushing for a public trial, the prosecution of former company officials, and more severe financial punishment for Boeing. The Justice Department has noted that the victims\u2019 families had mixed views on the proposed deal.",
      "Nadia Milleron, a Massachusetts resident whose 24-year-old daughter, Samya Stumo, died in the Ethiopia crash, in an email Thursday said it hurt her to read the Justice Department's \u201cfalse\u201d statement that the agreement will secure meaningful accountability, deliver public benefits and bring finality to a complex case whose outcome would otherwise be uncertain.",
      "\u201cThis is not a difficult or complex case because Boeing signed a confession,\u201d Milleron said. \u201cThere will be no accountability as a result of the NPA (non-prosecution deal).\u201d",
      "Boeing said in a statement that the company is committed to complying with its obligations under the resolution, including commitments to further institutional improvements and investments, as well as additional compensation for families of those who died in the two plane crashes.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply sorry for their losses, and remain committed to honoring their loved ones\u2019 memories by pressing forward with the broad and deep changes to our company that we have made to strengthen our safety system and culture,\u201d a Boeing spokesperson said in the statement.",
      "Attorney Mark Lindquist, who represents dozens of the victims' families said in a statement Thursday that although he had wanted to see a more vigorous prosecution, he didn't think it was going to happen.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I can only hope the criminal case and the lawsuits motivated Boeing to improve safety,\u201d Lindquist said. \u201cThat\u2019s what really matters. We all want to walk onto a Boeing plane and feel safe.\u201d",
      "Boeing was accused of misleading the Federal Aviation Administration about aspects of the Max before the agency certified the plane for flight. Boeing did not tell airlines and pilots about a new software system that could turn the plane\u2019s nose down without input from pilots if a sensor detected that the plane might go into an aerodynamic stall.",
      "The Max planes crashed after a faulty reading from the sensor pushed the nose down and pilots were unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded until the company redesigned the software.",
      "The Justice Department charged Boeing in 2021 with deceiving FAA regulators about the software and about how much training pilots would need to fly the plane safely. The department agreed not to prosecute Boeing at the time, however, if the company paid a $2.5 billion settlement, including the $243.6 million fine, and took steps to comply with anti-fraud laws for three years.",
      "But last year, federal prosecutors said Boeing violated the terms of the 2021 agreement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws. Boeing agreed last July to plead guilty to the felony fraud charge instead of enduring what could have been a lengthy public trial.",
      "Then in December, O'Connor rejected the plea deal. The judge said the diversity, inclusion and equity, or DEI, policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in picking a monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s compliance with the agreement.",
      "Under the new agreement, Boeing must retain an \u201cindependent compliance consultant\u201d who will make recommendations for \u201cfurther improvement\u201d and report back to the government, court documents said.",

      "TOKYO -- China will resume Japanese seafood imports that it banned in 2023 over worries about Japan's discharge of wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, a Japanese official said Friday.",
      "The issue has been a significant political and diplomatic point of tension for the wary Asian powers.",
      "Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the two sides reached an agreement after Japanese and Chinese officials met in Beijing and the imports will resume once the necessary paperwork is done.",
      "China did not immediately comment. China blocked imports of Japanese seafood because it said the release would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities in eastern China.",
      "Japanese officials have said the wastewater must be released to make room for the nuclear plant\u2019s decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligible.",
      "Friday's announcement is based on an agreement between the two nations that Beijing would take steps toward ending the ban by joining water sampling missions by the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The March 2011 nuclear meltdowns followed an earthquake and tsunami. There were meltdowns in the plant's three reactors, causing large amounts of radioactive water to accumulate. The water release has been a milestone for the plant\u2019s battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that officials say has hampered the daunting task of removing fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors.",
      "The wastewater was treated and heavily diluted to reduce the radioactivity as much as possible before Japan began discharging the wastewater in August 2023.",
      "Last September, then-Prime Minster Fumio Kishida said the two sides reached \u201ca certain level of mutual understanding\u201d that China would start working toward easing the import ban and join the IAEA expanded monitoring of wastewater discharges.",
      "People inside and outside Japan protested the initial wastewater release. Japanese fishing groups said they feared it would further damage the reputation of their seafood. Groups in China and South Korea also raised concerns.",
      "Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings has said the utility would compensate Japanese business owners appropriately for damages suffered by export bans.",

      "She noted that more than 60%, or roughly $8 billion, of the upcoming general fund budget is slated for health, education and public safety. The budget has not yet been approved.",
      "Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Santiago, vice president of Puerto Rico's Independence Party, said after the governor's address that the numbers announced are not sufficient given that thousands of certain government employees, including police officers, are needed.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n, a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, decried federal bureaucracy during her address, noting her administration would keep pushing to free some $18 billion in federal funds set aside to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid, which Hurricane Maria razed in September 2017 as a Category 4 storm.",
      "She also renewed her pledge to cancel the government\u2019s contract with Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico.",

      "He noted that in the past five months, Gonz\u00e1lez has presented three candidates for Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of state, two candidates for its justice department and another two candidates for its labor department. None of those positions have been filled as Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s party has failed so far to approve her nominees.",

      "The lawsuits come a little over a month after Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed the legislation restricting pharmacy benefit managers, also known as PBMs, which run prescription drug coverage for big clients that include health insurers and employers that provide coverage.",

      "The Trump administration is dropping plans to terminate leases for 34 offices in the Mine Safety and Health Administration",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The Trump administration is dropping plans to terminate leases for 34 offices in the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the agency responsible for enforcing mine safety laws, the Department of Labor said Thursday.",
      "Earlier this year, the Department of Government Efficiency, created by President Donald Trump and run by Elon Musk, had targeted federal agencies for spending cuts, including terminating leases for three dozen MSHA offices. Seven of those offices were in Kentucky alone. Ending the MSHA leases had been projected to save $18 million.",
      "Musk said this week that he\u2019s leaving his job as a senior adviser.",
      "A statement released by a Labor Department spokesperson Thursday said it has been working closely with the General Services Administration \u201cto ensure our MSHA inspectors have the resources they need to carry out their core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthy workplaces for American miners.\u201d",
      "Some MSHA offices are still listed on the chopping block on the DOGE website, but the statement did not indicate whether those closings will move forward.",
      "MSHA was created by Congress within the Labor Department in 1978, in part because state inspectors were seen as too close to the industry to force coal companies to take the sometimes costly steps necessary to protect miners. MSHA is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a relief and good news for miners and the inspectors at MSHA,\u201d said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for the agency.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly, in large part because of the dramatic decline in coal production. But the proposed DOGE cuts would have required MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what they were thinking when they talked about closing offices,\u201d Spadaro said. \u201cThey obviously did not understand the nature of the frequency and depth of inspections that go on in mines. It\u2019s important for the inspectors to be near the mine operations that they\u2019re inspecting.\u201d",
      "A review in March of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by staff at MSHA offices in the facilities on the chopping block. MSHA, which also oversees metal and nonmetal mines, already was understaffed. Over the past decade, it has seen a 27% reduction in total staff, including 30% of enforcement staff in general and 50% of enforcement staff for coal mines, the law center said.",
      "Coal industry advocates are also trying to save hundreds of jobs within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Some estimates had about 850 of the agency\u2019s roughly 1,000 employees being cut by the Trump administration.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered the restoration of a health monitoring program for coal miners and rescinded layoffs within NIOSH\u2019s respiratory health division in Morgantown, West Virginia. The division is responsible for screening and reviewing medical exams to determine whether there is evidence that coal miners have developed a respiratory ailment, commonly known as black lung disease.",
      "At a May 14 Congressional hearing, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was reversing the firing of about 330 NIOSH workers. That same day, the United Mine Workers of America was among several groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to reinstate all NIOSH staff and functions.",
      "\u201cFor months, coal communities have been raising the alarm about how cuts to MSHA and NIOSH would be disastrous for our miners,\u201d said Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association. \u201cWe\u2019re glad that the administration has listened and restored these offices, keeping mine inspectors in place.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep making progress and do whatever it takes to protect coal miners from black lung disease and accidents,\u201d she said.",

      "In one of the nation\u2019s first wrongful-death claims seeking to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the changing climate, a Washington state woman is suing seven oil and gas companies, saying they contributed to an extraordinarily hot day that led to her mother's fatal hyperthermia.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state court this week says the companies knew that their products have altered the climate, including contributing to a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest that killed 65-year-old Juliana Leon, and that they failed to warn the public of such risks.",
      "On June 28, 2021, an unusual heat wave culminated in a 108-degrees Fahrenheit (42.22 degrees Celsius) day \u2014 the hottest ever recorded in the state, according to the filing. Leon had just driven 100 miles from home for an appointment, and she rolled down her windows on the way back because her car's air conditioning wasn't working.",
      "Leon pulled over and parked her car in a residential area, according to the lawsuit. She was found unconscious behind the wheel when a bystander called for help. Despite medical interventions, Leon died.",
      "The filing names Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company.",
      "\u201cDefendants knew that their fossil fuel products were already altering the earth\u2019s atmosphere,\u201d when Juliana was born, Thursday\u2019s filing said. \u201cBy 1968, Defendants understood that the fossil fuel-dependent economy they were creating and perpetuating would intensify those atmospheric changes, resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters and foreseeable loss of human life.\u201d",
      "The filing adds: \u201cThe extreme heat that killed Julie was directly linked to fossil fuel-driven alteration of the climate.\u201d",
      "Chevron Corporation counsel Theodore Boutrous Jr. said in a statement: \u201cExploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense. The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.\u201d",
      "ConocoPhillips, BP, Shell and BP subsidiary Olympic Pipeline Company declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the companies of hiding, downplaying and misrepresenting the risks of climate change caused by humans burning oil and gas and obstructing research.",
      "International climate researchers said in a peer-reviewed analysis that the 2021 \u201cheat dome\u201d was \u201cvirtually impossible without human-caused climate change.\u201d",
      "Scientists have broadly attributed the record-breaking, more frequent, longer-lasting and increasingly deadly heat waves around the world to climate change that they say is a result of burning fossil fuels. Oil and gas are fossil fuels that, when burned, emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a really advanced scientific understanding about the specific effects that climate change can cause in individual extreme weather events,\u201d said Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. \u201cScientists today are a lot more confident in saying that but for climate change, this would not have happened.\"",
      "Silverman-Roati said the specificity of the case could clarify for people the consequences of climate change and the potential consequences of company behavior.",
      "The lawsuit was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\u201cBig Oil companies have known for decades that their products would cause catastrophic climate disasters that would become more deadly and destructive if they didn\u2019t change their business model,\u201d said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, said in a statement on the case. \u201cBut instead of warning the public and taking steps to save lives, Big Oil lied and deliberately accelerated the problem.\u201d",
      "States and cities have long gone after fossil fuel industry stakeholders for contributing to the planet\u2019s warming. Recently, Hawaii and Michigan announced plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change, though the states have been met by counter lawsuits from the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "The Trump administration has been quick to disregard climate change and has moved against initiatives aimed at combating it. The U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 an agency whose weather forecasting and research workforce has been gutted \u2014 will no longer track the cost of weather disasters fueled by climate change. And the Environmental Protection Agency has been called on to a rewrite its long-standing findings that determined planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal government has ramped up support for oil and gas production in the name of an \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d agenda, and it rolled back a host of other efforts and projects to address climate change.",
      "Around the world, other climate cases are being watched closely as potentially setting unique precedent in the effort to hold major polluters accountable. A German court ruled this week against a Peruvian farmer who claimed an energy company's greenhouse gas emissions fueled global warming and put his home at risk.",
      "Still, a case that looks to argue these companies should be held liable for an individual\u2019s death is rare. Misti Leon is seeking unspecified monetary damages.",
      "\u201cLooking ahead, it\u2019s hard to imagine this will be an isolated incident,\u201d said Don Braman, associate professor at George Washington University Law School. \"We\u2019re facing an escalating climate crisis. It\u2019s a sobering thought that this year, the hottest on record, will almost certainly be one of the coolest we\u2019ll experience for the foreseeable future.",
      "\u201cIt is predictable or \u2014 to use a legal term, foreseeable \u2014 that the loss of life from these climate-fueled disasters will likely accelerate as climate chaos intensifies,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the heart of all this is the argument about the culpability of fossil fuel companies, and it rests on a large and growing body of evidence that these companies have understood the dangers of their products for decades.\u201d",

      "But they say more than $4.5 billion of the funds were stolen and laundered through bribes and kickbacks.",

      "The scandal led to the fall of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak\u2019s government in 2018. Najib was later convicted by a Malaysian court of abuse of power and other crimes related to the scandal and sentenced to 12 years in prison.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it\u2019s navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power",
      "WASHINGTON -- Google returned to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues being dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers are attempting to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers say only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "Mehta used Friday's hearing to ask probing and pointed questions to lawyers for both sides while hinting that he was seeking a middle ground between the two camps' proposed remedies.",
      "\u201cWe're not looking to kneecap Google,\u201d the judge said, adding that the goal was to \u201ckickstart\u201d competitors' ability to challenge the search giant's dominance.",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Mehta indicated in court Friday that he was still undecided on how much AI\u2019s potential to shake up the search market should be incorporated in his forthcoming ruling. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been struggling with,\u201d Mehta said early in the hearing.",
      "Justice prosecutor David Dahlquist urged the judge to issue forward-thinking remedies that would \u201cpry open\u201d the search market to competition and not allow Google to use its search monopoly to unfairly benefit themselves in the AI race.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "Google\u2019s attorney John Schmidtlein said Friday that AI companies should \u201cget to work\u201d on their own products rather than try to persuade the court to give them unfair access to Google\u2019s innovations.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",

      "The Tohono O\u2019odham Nation had vowed when the case was dismissed to pursue all legal avenues for protecting land that it and other tribes consider sacred. Tribal Chairman Verlon Jose reiterated that the tribe will continue to fight for its rights and that Tuesday's ruling marked an important victory in the long-running dispute.",
      "\u201cThe Tohono O\u2019odham Nation supports clean, renewable energy \u2014 when it is done the right way,\u201d Jose said in a statement. \u201cWith the SunZia project, the federal government failed to work with tribes to protect our cultural resources as required by law.\"",
      "The valley represents a 50-mile (80-kilometer) stretch of the planned 550-mile (885-kilometer) conduit. The route is expected to carry electricity from wind farms in central New Mexico to existing transmission lines in Arizona to serve populated areas as far away as California. The project was among those touted as an important part of former President Joe Biden\u2019s goal for a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.",
      "Construction in the San Pedro Valley already is complete, said Matt Dallas, a SunZia spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing the opinion, and SunZia remains on track for commercial operation in 2026.\u201d Dallas said.",
      "In response to questions about the latest ruling and whether the federal government was in discussions with the tribes, Interior spokeswoman J. Elizabeth Peace said the department doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.",
      "Peace did say the agency \u201cremains committed to stewarding our natural and cultural resources, honoring tribal trust responsibilities and managing public lands for all Americans.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump in recent weeks has signed a number of executive orders promoting domestic energy production and has cited the need for reliability of the nation's electric grid amid growing demand driven partly by data centers and artificial intelligence.",

      "The Nebraska Legislature has passed a bill that significantly weakens a voter-backed measure requiring employers to offer paid sick leave",
      "Republicans in the Nebraska Legislature managed to pass a bill that significantly weakens a voter-backed measure requiring employers to offer paid sick leave. And they did it with the help of a Democrat.",
      "Backers of the bill overcame a filibuster on Wednesday with the exact number of votes needed \u2014 33 \u2014 thanks to the support of a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln.",
      "Raybould, whose family owns several grocery store chains in the state, was also the main sponsor of another bill that sought to restrict a voter-backed minimum wage law. That bill suffered an unexpected defeat earlier this session when a freshman lawmaker failed to show up for a vote on it. Raybould's attempt to attach it to the paid sick leave measure on Wednesday also failed.",
      "By a nearly 3-to-1 margin, Nebraska voters in November approved a ballot measure that requires all Nebraska employers to provide at least some paid sick leave to their employees.",
      "The ballot language, which had been set to take effect Oct. 1, required businesses to provide workers with one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to seven days at businesses with more than 20 employees. Employees at smaller businesses could accrue up to five days\u2019 worth of paid sick leave a year. The leave could be used for the employees themselves or to tend to a family member.",
      "But the bill passed Wednesday and expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jim Pillen carves out exceptions. It allows businesses to withhold paid sick leave from 14- and 15-year-olds, as well as from temporary and seasonal agricultural workers. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees would not need to provide paid sick leave at all.",
      "More concerning, opponents say, is a provision that strips from the new law the ability of workers to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave. The removal of that enforcement language would \u201cessentially gut\u201d the paid leave measure, said Sen. John Cavanaugh, who opposed the bill. Cavanaugh reiterated that paid sick leave received nearly 75% approval \u2014 more support than most lawmakers got at the polls.",
      "\u201cThe voters wanted this more than they wanted you here,\u201d he said, addressing fellow lawmakers. \u201cThis is about respect for the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Nebraska joins other states leading efforts to counter voter-approved policies on everything from paid sick leave to abortion. Some states are seeking to limit the voter initiative process itself, leading to pushback from voters.",
      "Supporters of the Nebraska paid sick leave rollback say they're seeking to protect both workers and businesses. Raybould has said throughout debate this session that teens under 16 will find themselves unable to get an after-school or summer job without changes to both minimum wage and paid sick leave measures. She says no one will hire teens with limited experience and federal child labor restrictions at $15 per hour \u2014 the minimum wage set to take effect Jan. 1.",
      "\u201cWe have to find that balance between business and labor,\u201d Raybould said during debate Wednesday. \u201cWe have to be competitive, and we have to be flexible.\u201d",
      "Others went further, with Republican Sen. Mike Jacobson saying that government telling businesses what wages and benefits they must offer employees \u201cthreatens democracy.\u201d If employees don't like the terms of their employment, he said, it's incumbent on them to find a different job.",
      "Sen. Robert Hallstrom is another Republican who supported restrictions on both the minimum wage and paid sick leave. He said the Legislature has the right to make changes to voter-backed measures, asking if young or seasonal workers who would be affected by those changes would \u201crather have a $10-an-hour job or no job?\u201d",
      "The Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans coalition, which was behind the effort to get paid sick leave on the Nebraska ballot last year, said the bill passed Wednesday would remove paid sick leave protections for 140,000 workers in the state.",
      "\u201cDespite thousands of Nebraskans demanding that our Legislature honor the clear will of voters, 33 senators ignored those calls yet again today,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"It will prevent thousands of Nebraskans from being able to access the good life.\u201d",

      "Businesses that have been unsettled by President Donald Trump\u2019s on again, off again tariffs don't know how much faith to put in the reprieve from a federal court that halted most of the taxes on foreign imports",
      "NEW YORK -- Businesses that have been unsettled by President Donald Trump's on again, off again tariffs grappled Thursday with how much faith to put in the latest reprieve, which came from a federal court that halted most of the taxes on foreign imports.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled late Wednesday that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency as justification for his wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal and requested an emergency stay that would keep the tariffs in place during ongoing legal proceedings that are widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Business owners and the National Retail Federation said that without a definitive word in the case, the New York-based trade court's ruling only creates more uncertainty and makes it harder to budget and plan orders.",
      "\u201cThe ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade blocking most of President Trump\u2019s tariffs is just another chapter in this difficult journey toward a clear, consistent and strategic trade policy,\" Jonathan Gold, the trade group's vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in an emailed statement. \"We urge rapid resolution as this process continues in the courts.\u201d",
      "The president invoked the emergency powers law in early April when he imposed varying import tax rates on products from dozens of countries, including the biggest trading partners of the U.S. After financial markets showed signs of panic, Trump lowered the rate to 10% for every country except China, whose goods were taxed at 145%.",
      "Jonathan Silva, the owner of WS Game Company, said he did not intend to change his plans based on the ruling. He has the board games his company sells made in China,",
      "\u201cWe know that this will take time for the appeals process to take place and a final ruling to be instituted,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut we are hopeful that this will be the beginning of a more academic use of tariffs in the coming months and years. All we want to do is have certainty in the environment that we are operating in, as the day-to-day retaliations and pauses are not conducive to business operations.\u201d",
      "The CEO of electronics retailer Best Buy, Corie Barry, told reporters on Thursday that the legal news did not make her more or less optimistic but rather underscored the importance of continuing to remain agile while not changing course in response to near-daily tariff developments.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we would do differently based on the news overnight,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWhat I really tried to work with the team on is to not actually overreact to any given moment in time, but instead to stay maniacally focused on our customers and ensure we are bringing the right assortment, price, and (promotions) to them, whatever the backdrop.\u201d",
      "Barry told analysts that Best Buy has taken a variety of steps to offset higher tariff costs, including pushing vendors to spread out where they do manufacturing. The company is increasing some prices to absorb tariff-related costs, she said, calling the move \u201ca last resort.\u201d She declined to be specific given the fluid situation.",
      "Jim Umlauf, whose business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others, said the court ruling did not offer reassurance but only further complicated his decision-making.",
      "\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t know whether the decision will hold, whether it applies to (Trump's) original 2018 tariffs, or how it will be enforced,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout clarity, we\u2019re left planning around a moving target. Like many others, we\u2019ve already locked in quotes and made purchasing decisions assuming tariffs would remain in place. This development, rather than offering relief, introduces new logistical complications at the worst possible time.\u201d",
      "Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan, the founder of a Salt Lake City kitchen and bathroom accessories company called Dorai Home, said she expected the trade war to continue. The constant flux since Trump's return to office has made her \u201cnumb,\u201d but O'Callaghan said she has tried to make educated decisions.",
      "The company already postponed the launch of several new products, laid off the CEO and some other key employees. It paused order shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis when the president Trump lowered the rate for Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days.",
      "Now, Dorai Home plans to test price increases to see if shoppers will still buy its products.",
      "\u201cIn a business sense, you have to try to create as much certainty and stability as you can with the variables you can control,\" O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "But some businesses were more optimistic. Burlington Coat Factory CEO Michael B. O\u2019Sullivan said Thursday that the tariff pause might help discount retailers like his that buy excess inventory from other retail companies.",
      "The court ruling and continued uncertainty may further fuel a production race that started when the tariff rate for Chinese products were substantially reduced, O'Sullivan said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s now a huge rush on production and shipping across the industry. Now, the court decision last night could add to that rush,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of shortages, this topsy-turvy stop/start surge has the potential to create attractive buying opportunities.\u201d",

      "Powell told Trump that the central bank would make decisions about the short-term interest rate it controls \u201cbased solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.\u201d The Fed's rate typically influences borrowing costs across the economy, including for mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing.",
      "The meeting comes as Trump has assailed Powell for not reducing the Fed\u2019s key interest rate, calling him \u201cToo Late Powell.\u201d The president initiated the meeting, the Fed said.",
      "Trump argues that there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and so Powell should cut rates, though such a move might not necessarily reduce the borrowing costs consumers face. Inflation is down substantially from a year ago, yet it remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Trump has also called Powell a \u201cfool\u201d and earlier this year suggested he would fire the Fed chair.",
      "After financial markets reacted negatively, Trump said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of removing Powell, whose term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "The meeting is the first during Trump\u2019s second term, though the two met and had lunch together in his first term. Fed chairs regularly meet with Treasury secretaries but less often with presidents, given that the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions are intended to be separate from political concerns.",
      "Earlier this month, Powell said he had never requested a meeting with a president and added, \u201cI never will,\u201d suggesting it was inappropriate given the Fed's political independence.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine myself doing that,\" Powell said at a press conference May 7. \u201cIt\u2019s always\u2014comes the other way: A President wants to meet with you.\u201d",

      "Czech Republic Justice Minister Pavel Bla\u017eek has resigned from his post over a bitcoin-related scandal",
      "PRAGUE -- Czech Republic Justice Minister Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from his post over a bitcoin-related scandal on Friday.",
      "Bla\u017eek was under fire from the opposition after his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for about 1 billion Czech koruna (more than $45 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn't aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Bla\u017eek was a close ally of Fiala in the government, and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. It's not clear who might replace him.",
      "The issue focused on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes. The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn't clear where the bitcoins came from. It was also not clear why the person donated the bitcoins to the ministry.",
      "The issue has been investigated by the police organized crime unit. The scandal took place just months before the Oct 3-4 parliamentary election. The main opposition ANO (YES) party led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 is predicted to win the vote.",

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus on Friday unveiled four of its newly-delivered Airbus H145 helicopters that officials say are among the most advanced rotorcraft in the word with a proven track record that gives the Cypriot National Guard an operational edge.",
      "The helicopter is currently used by Germany, the U.S. Hungary, Belgium, Ireland and other militaries with over 500 variants currently in operation, logging over 8 million flight hours, according to Cyprus Defense Minister Vassilis Palmas.",
      "\u201cThe new helicopter is a multi-role, digital instrument that is geared toward the demands of the 21st century,\u201d Palmas told a ceremony at Cyprus\u2019 main Paphos air base.",
      "Two more of the state-of-the-art aircraft will be delivered, while the contract with Airbus allows for the purchase of additional helicopters, said Airbus Senior Vice President for the H145 program Daniela Dudek.",
      "Dudek said the reliability of the 3.8 ton aircraft is affirmed by its 40 years of service but the integration of advanced avionics and weapons systems make it the \u201cmost military-capable aircraft in its category.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we achieved over years to quickly integrate existing technology on the market, defense technology, and it is unique what you have here. You\u2019re even more advanced than what we currently have in Germany,\u201d Dudek said.",
      "The helicopter's advanced avionics, which Airbus codeveloped with Israeli companies in the last two years, also includes an integrated weapons system dubbed H-Force which enables the pilot to easily operate the helicopters weaponry in flight, eliminating the need for a separate weapons officer on board.",
      "Dudek said another unique aspect of the Cypriot helicopters is an integrated battle management system that enables the aircraft to operate seamlessly with forces on the ground as well as other aircraft, including those belonging to the forces of other nations.",
      "Additionally, the helicopter\u2019s electronic warfare and other systems afford it a strong self-protection capability.",
      "Ethnically-divided Cyprus is in the process of modernizing its defensive capabilities to bring it up to modern European and NATO standards after years of relying on mainly Soviet-era, Russian-made weaponry. The island nation continues to operate Russian-made T-80 main battle tanks, but has recently sold off 11 Russian-made Mi35 attack helicopters to Serbia.",
      "Cyprus was split in 1974, when Turkey invaded following a coup by Athens junta-backed supporters of uniting the island with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence and maintains more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s northern third.",
      "The Cypriot defense minister said the helicopter purchase is part of wider strategic planning for the continuous upgrading of the National Guard, enabling the island to take part in joint military drills with friendly nations.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

      "In a pristine corner of the Amazon, Brazilian and British scientists have spent more than two decades simulating drought to understand how the rainforest might respond to a drier future",
      "CAXIUANA NATIONAL FOREST, Brazil -- A short walk beneath the dense Amazon canopy, the forest abruptly opens up. Fallen logs are rotting, the trees grow sparser and the temperature rises in places sunlight hits the ground. This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "California, which is home to some of the largest tech companies in the world, will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent starting in 2027. And New York state allows parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform\u2019s algorithm.",

      "An alleged kidnapping in New York is the latest instance in which authorities say cryptocurrency-related crimes have involved real-world violence",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A man says he was tortured for weeks in a New York townhouse. Another in Paris was held for ransom and his finger cut off. A couple in Connecticut were carjacked, beaten and thrown into a van.",
      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.",
      "The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States\u2019 official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F.

      "The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.",
      "The alleged attempted robbery is known as a \u201cwrench attack.\u201d It\u2019s a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.",
      "Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency\u2019s move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,\u201d Ariss said.",
      "Some of the crypto\u2019s key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.",
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent.

      "Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.",
      "Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \u201csomething exotic\u201d and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\u201cWhile our discovery doesn\u2019t yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\u201d Wang said. \u201cEither we are uncovering something entirely new, or we\u2019re seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d",

      "After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.",
      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe.

      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",

      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "Aix-Marseille University in France started the \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program in March \u2014 pledging to \u201cwelcome\u201d U.S.-based scientists who \u201cmay feel threatened or hindered in their research.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s \u201cGlobal Talent Attraction Program,\u201d announced in April, promises competitive salaries and relocation packages.",
      "\u201cIn response to what is happening in the U.S.,\u201d said Anna-Maria Arabia, head of the Australian Academy of Sciences, \u201cwe see an unparalleled opportunity to attract some of the smartest minds here.\u201d",
      "Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world\u2019s leading scientific power \u2014 and has led to the invention of cell phones and the internet as well as new ways to treat cancer, heart disease and strokes, noted Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the journal Science.",
      "But today that system is being shaken.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",
      "Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. \u2014 but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.",
      "\u201cThere are threats to science ... south of the border,\u201d said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada\u2019s leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the \u201cCanada Leads\u201d recruitment drive. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.\u201d",
      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",
      "U.S.-based applicants in this year\u2019s recruitment round for France\u2019s Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.",
      "At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program \u2014 aimed at young female researchers \u2014 drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.",
      "Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.",
      "Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., \u201cwe are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.\u201d",
      "Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.",
      "Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he\u2019s applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,\u201d said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "But it\u2019s not easy to pick up and move a scientific career \u2014 let alone a life.",
      "Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like \u201cAmerica as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.\u201d",
      "Still, she wasn\u2019t sure of her next move. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,\u201d she said.",
      "The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide \u201cChoose Europe\u201d initiative.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.",
      "Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there\u2019s more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.",
      "\u201cScience is a global endeavor,\u201d said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators.",
      "One aim of recruitment drives is to \u201cto help prevent the loss of talent to the global scientific community,\u201d he said.",
      "Researchers worldwide will suffer if collaborations are shut down and databases taken offline, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,\u201d said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology. So the cuts and policies were \u201cvery frightening also for us because it was an example for the whole world.\u201d",

      "Hegseth made his remarks in a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, which is organized by the International Institute for Security Studies and is a high-profile gathering of regional and international security leaders.",
      "His remarks laid out how the Trump administration sees the Indo-Pacific region as a \"priority theater\" and how the U.S. is prepared to stand by allies in a region where China continues to carry out aggressive military actions, particularly against Taiwan and the Philippines.",
      "\"We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not instigate nor seek to subjugate or humiliate,\" Hegseth said. \"President Trump and the American people have immense respect for the Chinese people and their civilization, but we will not be pushed out of this critical region. And we will not let our allies and partners be subordinated and intimidated.\"",
      "In recent years China has invested heavily in building up its military and increased its naval and air presence around Taiwan, engaging in almost daily harassment of Taiwan's borders -- raising concerns that it is preparing to retake by force the island nation it considers a breakaway province.",

      "\"To be clear: any attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the world,\" said Hegseth who stressed that China may be ready to act sooner than the 2027 deadline that China's President Xi Jinping had set for China's military to be prepared for possible action against Taiwan.",
      "\"There is no reason to sugarcoat it. The threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent -- we hope not, but it certainly could be,\" said Hegseth.",
      "China has also increased tensions with the Philippines where Chinese military vessels regularly harass Philippine ships operating in the international waters of the South China Sea as it continues to assert its territorial claims in the region.",
      "Relations between the U.S. and China have also soured following Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Chinese imports that led China to announce reciprocal tariffs. Both sides have since entered into a shaky temporary agreement to lower their tariffs.",

      "Republican Sens. Eric Schmitt and John Cornyn will co-chair a first-of-its-kind Senate Judiciary Committee hearing next month on the subject, which they say was covered up by members of the media. The focus echoes President Donald Trump's oft-repeated claims about Biden's mental fitness while president and criticism of Biden's use of autopen, a mechanical device to automatically add a signature to a document that's been utilized by several past presidents, including Trump in his first term.",
      "\"We need to get past the failures of the media, which were legend as you pointed out, or the political issue of 'were you for Biden or against Biden?' This is about a constitutional crisis, where we basically have a mentally incompetent president who's not in charge,\" Cornyn said Thursday on Fox News' \"The Will Cain Show.\"",
      "\"The question is: Who is in charge? Whose finger is on the nuclear button or has the nuclear codes? Who can declare war? How do we defend the nation when we have basically an absent president? And those are constitutional issues we need to address and correct,\" Cornyn said.",

      "\"What I can say is that we're not looking back, we're gonna continue to look forward because at this moment, we've got real problems that need to be addressed on behalf of the American people, including the Republican effort to snatch away health care, to snatch away food assistance and hurt veterans,\" Jeffries said.",

      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has also dodged any questions about Biden's health, responding to CNN's Kasie Hunt earlier this month by saying, \"Kasie, we're looking forward.\"",

      "Audience members at the Butler County, Iowa, event raised concerns that proposed cuts to Medicaid under the Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" being mulled in the Senate could threaten the lives of individuals who lose access to health care or food benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). As Ernst explained her position on removing those who should not qualify for Medicaid under the current law from eligibility, an audience member could be heard shouting back at her, \"People are going to die.\"",
      "Ernst quipped back, \"Well, we all are going to die,\" she said.",

      "\"Well, what you don't want to do is listen to me when I say that we are going to focus on those who are most vulnerable. Those who meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid we will protect. We will protect them,\" Ernst continued. \"Medicaid is extremely important here in the state of Iowa. If you don't want to listen, that is fine, but what I am doing is going through and telling you that those that are not eligible, those that are working and have the opportunity for benefits elsewhere, then they should receive those benefits elsewhere and leave those dollars for those that are eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "Medicaid benefits have become a key focus of negotiations on a massive spending package that Republicans, under the direction of Trump, are working to move through Congress.",
      "House Republicans passed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" last week. The House version of the bill implements Medicaid reforms and changes to other programs while extending the Trump 2017 tax cuts and plussing up spending in areas such as border security and defense spending.",
      "It will also add about $3.8 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",
      "Republicans stress that their version of the bill aims to create savings in Medicaid by targeting \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" in the system. Speaker Mike Johnson has said the proposal includes going after those who are \"defrauding the system.\"",
      "The Medicaid provisions proposed by Republicans have not yet been scored by the CBO, though a score is expected next week.",
      "The Senate has promised modifications to the bill, a fact that Ernst pointed to repeatedly during her town hall. Still, in her home state, concerns about Medicaid ruled the discussion.

      "CLOVIS, Calif. -- California\u2019s high school track-and-field state finals will award one extra medal Saturday in events where a transgender athlete places in the top three, a rule change that may be the first of its kind nationally by a high school sports governing body.",
      "The new California Interscholastic Federation policy was written in response to the success of high school junior AB Hernandez, a trans student who competes in the girls high jump, long jump and triple jump. She led in all three events after preliminaries Friday. The CIF said earlier this week it would let an additional student compete and medal in the events where Hernandez qualified.",
      "The two-day championship kicked off in the sweltering heat at high school near Fresno. The atmosphere was relatively quiet Friday despite critics \u2014 including parents, conservative activists and President Donald Trump \u2014 calling for Hernandez to be barred from girls competition leading up to the meet.",
      "There was some pushback Friday. A group of fewer than 10 people gathered outside the stadium ahead of the meet to protest Hernandez's participation. Some of them wore \u201cSave Girls\u2019 Sports\u201d T-shirts. At one point as Hernandez was attempting a high jump, someone in the stands yelled an insult. An aircraft circled above the stadium for more than an hour during the events, carrying a banner that read, \u201cNo Boys in Girls\u2019 Sports!\u201d",
      "The rest of the night ran smoothly for Hernandez, who finished the triple jump with a mark close to 41 feet (13 meters), nearly 10 inches (25 centimeters) ahead of her closest competitor, San Francisco Bay Area junior Kira Gant Hatcher.",
      "Hernandez also led in the long jump with a mark close to 20 feet (6 meters) to advance to the final. She advanced in the high jump, clearing 5 feet, 5 inches (1.7 meters) with ease.",
      "She did not address the press.",
      "The CIF rule change reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls\u2019 participation in youth sports.",
      "\u201cThe CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\u201d the group said in a statement after announcing its rule change.",
      "A recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women\u2019s sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats.",
      "The federation announced the rule change after Trump threatened this week to pull federal funding from California unless it bars trans female athletes from competing on girls teams. The CIF said it decided on the change before then.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice also said it would investigate the state federation and the district that includes Hernandez\u2019s high school to determine whether they violated federal sex discrimination law by allowing trans girls to compete in girls sports.",
      "Some California Republicans also weighed in, with several state lawmakers attending a news conference to criticize the federation for keeping Hernandez in the competition and a Republican gubernatorial candidate planning to attend Saturday's finals.",
      "California law allows trans students to compete on sex-segregated sports teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "The federation said the rule would open the field to more \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes. One expert said the change may itself be discriminatory because it creates an extra spot for \u201cbiological female\u201d athletes but not for other trans athletes.",
      "The federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\u201d or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.",
      "Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn\u2019t worry about critics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.",
      "California\u2019s state championship stands out from that of other states because of the number of competitors athletes are up against to qualify. The state had the second-largest number of students participating in outdoor track and field in the nation during the 2023-2024 school year, behind Texas, according to a survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations.",
      "Olympians Marion Jones and Tara Davis-Woodhall previously set state championship records in the long jump in 1993 and 2017, respectively, both surpassing 22 feet (6.7 meters).",
      "The boys 100-meter dash heats were also a highlight Friday. Junior Jaden Jefferson of De La Salle High School in Concord finished in 10.01 seconds, about .2 seconds faster than a meet record set in 2023. Jefferson's time won't count as a record unless he can replicate his results in the final.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Many U.S. corporations this year stopped supporting Pride events that celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in budget shortfalls ahead of the summer festivities and raising questions about corporate America\u2019s commitment to the cause.",
      "The moves come as President Donald Trump has shown antipathy for trans protections and has attempted to roll back some LGBTQ+ friendly federal policies. Experts also note that a growing slice of the public has grown tired of companies taking a stance on social and political issues.",
      "San Francisco Pride, the nonprofit that produces one of the country\u2019s largest and best-known LGBTQ+ celebrations, is facing a $200,000 budget gap after corporate donors dropped out. In Kansas City, Missouri, KC Pride lost about $200,000 \u2014 roughly half its annual budget.",

      "In response, many Pride organizations have canceled some dance parties, reduced the number of stages, hired less pricey headliners and no longer give volunteers free food or T-shirts.",
      "But the core celebrations will go on. In San Francisco, this year\u2019s Pride theme is \u201cQueer Joy is Resistance.\u201d In New York, it's \u201cRise Up: Pride in Protest,\u201d and, in Boston, it's \u201cHere to Stay!\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you come to Pride this year, that\u2019s a revolutionary act,\u201d said Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride. \u201cYou are sending a message to those in Washington that, here in San Francisco, we still have the same values that we\u2019ve always had \u2014 you can love who you love here. We\u2019re not going to retreat from that.\u201d",
      "Following media coverage of their retreat, some companies changed course but asked that their names not be affiliated with the events, the event organizers said.",

      "\u201cWith everything we\u2019re facing from the Trump administration, to lose five of your partners within a couple of weeks, it felt like we were being abandoned,\u201d Ford said.",
      "After the withdrawals drew attention, some corporations said they would donate but only anonymously, Ford said, declining to identify those companies. As of this week, neither Comcast, Anheuser-Busch nor Diageo appeared on the organization\u2019s website as sponsors of the June 29 festivities. It was unclear if they donated.",
      "Anheuser-Busch and Diageo didn\u2019t reply to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. A spokesperson for Comcast also declined to comment but said some of its companies are sponsoring Silicon Valley Pride and Oakland Pride.",

      "Piedmont said NYC Pride has also received anonymous corporate funding and that he appreciates the unpublicized support.",
      "\u201cWriting a check to a nonprofit and supporting a nonprofit with no strings attached is stepping up to the plate,\u201d Piedmont said.",
      "The shift reflects how corporations are adjusting to a changing cultural landscape that began during the pandemic and accelerated with Trump's second term, experts said.",
      "\u201cCompanies are resourceful, they are clever at identifying trends and studying their environment and their customers\u2019 needs, but those needs change and corporations adjust,\u201d said Amir Grinstein, a marketing professor at Northeastern University.",
      "Corporations' presence in rainbow-filled Pride parades, concerts and dance parties became more ubiquitous after the landmark 2015 Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, as companies splashed their names on parade floats, rainbow flags and bright plastic bracelets.",
      "So-called brand activism reached its peak between 2016 to 2022, a period of social upheaval around the pandemic, police brutality and transgender rights, Grinstein said.",
      "But research has since found a growing number of American consumers don't want companies taking positions on such topics, said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.",

      "San Francisco's organizers cut ties with Meta after the parent company of Facebook and Instagram terminated its DEI goals and content moderation policies.",
      "Twin Cities Pride ended its relationship with Target over the Minneapolis-based retailer's curtailing of its DEI initiatives following a backlash from conservatives and the White House. The company's retreat from DEI policies led to a counter-boycott by civil rights advocates.",
      "Target announced in May that sales fell more than expected in the first quarter due to customer boycotts, tariffs and other economic factors. The company now offers only some Pride products at a few stores and online.",

      "The week began with Capricorn Clark, a personal assistant who was later a global brand director for Combs\u2019 company. She recalled witnessing Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, and said he raged about wanting to kill rapper and romantic rival Kid Cudi.",
      "It ended with another ex-assistant, testifying under the pseudonym \u201cMia,\" who alleges Combs raped her during a torturous eight-year tenure working for the rap star. She is the second of three women expected to testify that he sexually assaulted them. Combs has pleaded not guilty.",

      "Then, she testified, she watched in shock as Combs viciously assaulted Cassie, his on-again, off-again girlfriend for more than a decade, in 2011 after learning she was dating Cudi. Clark said her \u201cheart was breaking from seeing her get hit like that,\" and neither she nor Combs\u2019 bodyguard intervened.",

      "She also testified about her own run-ins with Combs, telling jurors that he kidnapped her at gunpoint and took her to Cudi\u2019s house as he fumed that he was going to kill the rapper. Cudi testified that he believed Cassie and Combs had broken up. He said his relationship with Cassie only lasted a few weeks.",

Their first daughter, Frankie Stone Fine, was born in 2019. They welcomed a second daughter, Sunny Cinco Fine, in 2021.",
      "Jurors heard from a Los Angeles police officer who responded to the December 2011 break-in at Cudi\u2019s home and an arson investigator who spoke about his efforts to solve the firebombing of Cudi's Porsche 911 weeks later.",
      "Officer Chris Ignacio said he found Christmas gifts, some opened, with luxury watches and purses. Cudi has testified that his dog was traumatized after being locked in a bathroom by intruders.",
      "Ignacio said he saw a car with tinted windows registered to Bad Boy outside the house but didn't approach it because he had no proof a crime had occurred.",
      "Prosecutors are trying to prove that Combs was behind the break-in and the subsequent firebombing, which involved a Molotov cocktail dropped through a hole sliced in the convertible\u2019s fabric roof.",
      "Lance Jimenez, a Los Angeles Fire Department arson investigator, said the explosive was made from a 40-ounce Olde English 800 malt liquor bottle and a silky designer handkerchief.",
      "\u201cI personally felt it was targeted,\u201d he said of the Jan. 9, 2012, attack.",
      "Celebrity stylist Deonte Nash was a witness like no other, adding flair and humor within seconds of taking the stand on Wednesday. Asked if he wanted to testify, he declared: \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d",
      "Nash said he knew Combs as \u201cPuff\u201d and Cassie as \u201cCass.\u201d He said he responded to a Craigslist ad and started working at Bad Boy Entertainment as an intern and then a stylist from 2008 to 2018.",
      "Prosecutor Maurene Comey put a picture of Nash in front of him and asked, \"Is it a glamour shot of you?\u201d",
      "\u201cYes. I look amazing,\u201d Nash responded, drawing laughs.",
      "Asked what he had heard Combs call Cassie over the years, Nash answered \u201cUm, Baby Girl, CC, Cass\u201d and then listed a number of slurs against women. Asked how often Combs used one particular slur, Nash said: \u201cUm, quite a bit. That was his fave.\u201d",
      "Nash later testified that Cassie had confided in him that she didn't always want to go along with Combs\u2019 demands that she have sex with other men during his drug-fueled \u201cfreak-off\u201d marathons.",
      "Mia testified that Combs sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions: forcibly kissing her and putting his hand up her dress at his 40th birthday party, forcing her to perform oral sex as they packed for a trip, and raping her after he climbed into her bed at his Los Angeles home.",
      "Mia said she thought her sexual abuse was sporadic enough that each time it occurred, she thought it would never happen again. She said she put on a brave face and continued to work for Combs, in part because she felt shame, blamed herself and feared what would happen if she reported him to authorities.",
      "Cassie testified previously that Combs raped her after she broke up with him in 2018.",
      "Mia said she witnessed Combs physically attacking Cassie \u201call the time\u201d at his houses, her apartments, hotels, events and while traveling. She said Combs also turned his wrath on her, throwing her into a swimming pool, dumping a bucket of ice on her and hurling a bowl of spaghetti in her direction.",
      "Prosecutors insisted all week that they are ahead of schedule in presenting their case and said they could be done calling witnesses by mid-June.",
      "But Combs lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the defense\u2019s presentation might take longer than expected \u2014 particularly after prosecutors revealed they were making \u201cfairly substantial changes\u201d to their plan.",
      "\u201cIt may be that because of witnesses the government is not calling, we might have more on the defense case,\u201d he said.",
      "As a result, he added, the trial might run to the start of July.",

      "The 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail more than two weeks ago by cutting out a hole behind a toilet received help from at least 14 people, many of them friends and family who provided food, cash, transport and shelter according to court documents",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail more than two weeks ago by cutting out a hole behind a toilet received help from at least 14 people, many of them friends and family who provided food, cash, transport and shelter according to court documents.",
      "Records reviewed by The Associated Press show how some of the fugitives received aid before and after their escape \u2014 including from a number of people named in police reports but not yet facing charges.",
      "A former jail employee is accused of driving escapee Lenton Vanburen to a relative's home and helping him FaceTime family the day of the escape, while another friend later offered him a hiding place in a vacant apartment he had been hired to repaint.",
      "Others sent money via apps, lied to authorities during interrogation and messaged or called the fugitives, police say. Some are now held on bonds $1 million or higher and most face the felony charge of accessory after the fact.",
      "In a city with an entrenched mistrust of the criminal justice system, authorities on Thursday raised the reward to $50,000 per fugitive. They stressed that friends and family are key to capturing the two remaining escapees, convicted murderer Derrick Groves and Antoine Massey, who faces kidnapping and rape charges.",
      "\u201cWe understand that some of you might be reporting a friend, a loved one, a relative and albeit not easy, it is critical to your safety and the safety of the public that you report them,\u201d Jonathan Tapp, special agent in charge of FBI New Orleans, said Thursday.",
      "After the audacious escape in the early hours of May 16, a woman who police described as \u201cassociated\u201d with Groves \u201cpicked up\u201d and transported escapee Vanburen to a relative's residence, the documents show.",
      "She then video-called Vanburen's sisters, who came to meet him.",
      "This woman \u2014 who has not been charged with aiding in the escape \u2014 shares the same name as a former Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office employee, according to court records. In 2023, that employee was arrested for bringing a folding knife and a bag of Cheetos containing tobacco and marijuana into the jail.",
      "The charges were dropped in part due to the woman's lack of criminal history and she \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d a pretrial diversion program, the Orleans Parish District Attorney's office told The Associated Press. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office did not respond to request for comment.",
      "In a text message to an AP reporter, the woman denied bringing in contraband or aiding fugitives.",
      "Separately, authorities arrested a jail plumber they say helped the men escape, but his attorney maintains he was just trying to unclog a toilet.",
      "Several escapees, including Massey, relied on internet phone services to communicate with accomplices and \u201cavoid detection\" by not leaving a trail of cellular signals, police reports say.",
      "Escapee Corey Boyd used an internet phone service to message several contacts seeking money and access to their iCloud accounts, threatening to kill one person if they did not comply, court records show.",
      "The FBI reviewed months of calls from Boyd's \u201ctop caller\u201d while incarcerated. They then found a brief call from a new phone number the night after the escape and used that to help track down Boyd. They discovered that Boyd\u2019s aunt was messaging him on Instagram to help him get food as hid in the apartment where a SWAT team captured him May 20.",
      "One of the women accused of helping Massey suffered from years of physical abuse from him, court records show.",
      "The woman, who had previously filed a protective order against Massey after he attempted to strangle her, was aware of his planned escape and later misled authorities, police say.",
      "She exchanged messages with Massey\u2019s 31-year-old sister saying they hoped he \"never gets caught.\"",
      "Authorities staked out the New Orleans home of Massey\u2019s sister but a search six days after the escape turned up empty-handed. Police learned Massey had been inside the home before the raid and altered and deleted evidence on his sister's phone.",
      "Court records show police accuse Massey's sister of lying to them, slowing down the manhunt and forcing them to lose \u201ccritical days and hours\u201d in the search.",
      "At least seven of the people facing felony charges for aiding the fugitives have ties to Lenton Vanburen, Jr. according to authorities.",
      "After alerting two of his sisters by prison phone in the hours before his escape, he instructed they contact \u201cmy girl\u201d and provide her with a \u201cclean phone\u201d so the two could communicate.",
      "The woman identified by police as Vanburen's love interest told The Associated Press she never received the phone and denied involvement in the escape plans.",
      "Vanburen's sisters met up with him the night of his escape at a family member's residence where he was able to shower, change clothes and was given toiletries. Another family member later reportedly took him to a relative's home in Mississippi.",
      "Vanburen was ultimately captured in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Monday and two men arrested this week were accused of helping him find shelter in a hotel \u2014 paid for in cash \u2014 and an apartment undergoing renovation. The Baton Rouge court system had no record of their legal representation.",
      "In another case, a 59-year-old Louisiana woman is accused of sending cash to fugitive Jermaine Donald, a family friend, according to her attorney.",
      "Lindsey Hortenstine, communications director for the Orleans Parish Public Defenders\u2019 office, said that most of the people arrested in connection with helping the fugitives have not yet secured attorneys.",
      "Louisiana State Police Superintendent Colonel Robert Hodges said tips from friends and family remain essential to locating the remaining fugitives.",

    "story": [
      "Would U.S. companies go back to Russia if there\u2019s a peace deal over Ukraine",
      "Hundreds of foreign companies left Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, including major U.S. firms like Coca-Cola, Nike, Starbucks, ExxonMobil and Ford Motor Co.",
      "But after more than three years of war, President Donald Trump has held out the prospect of restoring U.S.-Russia trade if there\u2019s ever a peace settlement. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has said foreign companies could come back under some circumstances.",
      "\u201cRussia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic \u2018bloodbath\u2019 is over, and I agree,\u201d Trump said in a statement after a phone call with Putin. \u201cThere is a tremendous opportunity for Russia to create massive amounts of jobs and wealth. Its potential is UNLIMITED.\u201d",
      "The president then shifted his tone toward Putin after heavy drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, saying Putin \u201chas gone absolutely crazy\u201d and threatening new sanctions. That and recent comments from Putin warning Western companies against reclaiming their former stakes seemed to reflect reality more accurately \u2014 that it\u2019s not going to be a smooth process for businesses going back into Russia.",
      "That\u2019s because Russia\u2019s business environment has massively changed since 2022. And not in ways that favor foreign companies.",
      "And with Putin escalating attacks and holding on to territory demands Ukraine likely isn\u2019t going to accept, a peace deal seems distant indeed.",
      "Here are factors that could deter U.S. companies from ever going back:",
      "Russian law classifies Ukraine\u2019s allies as \u201cunfriendly states\u201d and imposes severe restrictions on businesses from more than 50 countries. Those include limits on withdrawing money and equipment as well as allowing the Russian government to take control of companies deemed important. Foreign owners\u2019 votes on boards of directors can be legally disregarded.",
      "Companies that left were required to sell their businesses for 50% or less of their assessed worth, or simply wrote them off while Kremlin-friendly business groups snapped up their assets on the cheap. Under a 2023 presidential decree the Russian government took control of Finnish energy company Fortum, German power company Unipro, France\u2019s dairy company Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg.",
      "Even if a peace deal removed the U.S. from the list of unfriendlies, and if the massive Western sanctions restricting business in Russia were dropped, the track record of losses would remain vivid. And there\u2019s little sign any of that is going to happen.",
      "While the Russian government has talked in general about companies coming back, \u201cthere\u2019s no specific evidence of any one company saying that they are ready to come back,\u201d said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s all at the political narrative level.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions and legal changes have left \u201clong-lasting damage\u201d to its business environment, says Elina Ribakova, non-resident senior fellow at the Bruegel research institute in Brussels.",
      "She said a return of U.S. businesses is \u201cnot very likely.\u201d",
      "In a meeting at the Kremlin on May 26 to mark Russian Entrepreneurs Day, Putin said that Russia needed to throttle large tech firms such as Zoom and Microsoft, which had restricted their services in Russia after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, so that domestic tech companies could thrive instead.",
      "\u201cWe need to strangle them,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAfter all, they are trying to strangle us: we need to reciprocate. We didn\u2019t kick anyone out; we didn\u2019t interfere with anyone. We provided the most favorable conditions possible for their work here, in our market, and they are trying to strangle us.\u201d",
      "He reassured a representative from Vkusno-i Tochka (Tasty-period) \u2014 the Russian-owned company that took over McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the country \u2014 that Moscow would aid them if the U.S. fast food giant tried to buy back its former stores. Asked for comment, McDonald\u2019s referred to their 2022 statement that \u201cownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable.\u201d",
      "On top of Russia\u2019s difficult business environment, the economy is likely to stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military, economists say.",
      "\u201cRussia has one of the lowest projected long-term growth rates and one of the highest levels of country risk in the world,\u201d says Heli Simola, senior economist at the Bank of Finland in a blog post. \u201cOnly Belarus offers an equally lousy combination of growth and risk.\u201d",
      "Most of the opportunity to make money is related to military production, and it\u2019s unlikely U.S. companies would work with the Russian military-industrial complex, said Ribakova. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear where exactly one could plug in and expect outsize returns that would compensate for this negative investment environment.\u201d",
      "Some companies, including Renault and Ford Motor Co., left with repurchase agreements letting them buy back their stakes years later if conditions change. But given Russia\u2019s unsteady legal environment, that\u2019s tough to count on.",
      "The Russian purchasers may try to change the terms, look for more money, or ignore the agreements, said Weafer. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to how those buyback auctions will be enforced.\u201d",
      "Multinational oil companies were among those who suffered losses leaving Russia, so it\u2019s an open question whether they would want to try again even given Russia\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves. US.. major ExxonMobil saw its stake in the Sakhalin oil project unilaterally terminated and wrote off $3.4 billion.",
      "Russia\u2019s major oil companies have less need of foreign partners than they did in the immediate post-Soviet era, though smaller oil field services might want to return given the size of Russia\u2019s oil industry. But they would have to face new requirements on establishing local presence and investment, Weafer said.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics, 2,329 foreign companies are still doing business in Russia, many from China or other countries that aren\u2019t allied with Ukraine, while 1,344 are in the process of leaving and 494 have exited completely. The Yale School of Management\u2019s Chief Executive Leadership Institute lists some two dozen U.S. companies still doing business in Russia, while some 100 more have cut back by halting new investments.",
      "U.S. sanctions are considered the toughest, because they carry the threat of being cut off from the U.S. banking and financial system. But the EU is still slapping new rounds of sanctions on Russia. Even if U.S. sanctions are dropped, EU sanctions would continue to present compliance headaches for any company that also wants to do business in Europe.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will seek to energize activists at Democratic state conventions in South Carolina and California on Saturday, as the party's 2024 vice presidential nominee works to keep up the high national profile he gained when Kamala Harris selected him as her running mate.",
      "Walz, a former schoolteacher who went to Congress and then became his state\u2019s governor, will keynote the South Carolina gathering in Columbia, traditionally a showcase for national-level Democrats and White House hopefuls. Another leader who often appears on those lists, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, spoke Friday night at the party\u2019s fundraising dinner.",
      "South Carolina held the first Democratic presidential primary of the 2024 campaign, and the party hopes for a repeat as first in line in 2028. But the national party organizations haven't settled their 2028 calendars yet, and party officials in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada are also vying to go first.",
      "\u201cFrom the classroom to the governor\u2019s office, Tim Walz leads with compassion and common sense,\u201d the South Carolina party posted on social media earlier this month when it announced his appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s proof that you can govern with both heart and backbone, and he\u2019s bringing that message to South Carolina.\u201d",
      "Walz, who's on a long list of potential 2028 candidates who have been traveling to early-voting states, will also be a featured speaker as California Democrats gather in Anaheim on Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fired up to welcome Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to the Convention stage in Anaheim,\u201d state chair Rusty Hicks said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s a former teacher, a veteran, and a trailblazer who\u2019s spent his career fighting for working families and standing up for the values we all share \u2014 fairness, dignity, and opportunity for all.\u201d",
      "Democrats have been debating since Harris lost to President Donald Trump in November over which direction the party should take. That self-examination reflects deep frustrations among Democratic voters that their leaders are failing to put up enough resistance against Trump, who has taken a much more aggressive approach to his second term in the White House.",
      "Walz hasn't officially said if he'll seek a third term in 2026, but acknowledges he's thinking about it. He said in a recent interview with KSTP-TV that he would probably wait to decide until July, after he calls a special session of the closely divided Minnesota Legislature to finish work on the state's next budget. Those negotiations have gone slowly despite his frequent meetings with legislative leaders.",
      "He's given mixed signals on a 2028 presidential run while keeping up his attacks on Trump. He told The New Yorker Radio Hour for an interview that aired in March that he would \u201ccertainly consider that\u201d if circumstances were right. He told CNN's \u201cState of the Union\u201d last month that he was \u201cnot thinking about running in 2028.\u201d",

      "The explosive growth of the data centers needed to power America\u2019s fast-rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing has spurred states to dangle incentives in hopes of landing an economic bonanza",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The explosive growth of the data centers needed to power America's fast-rising demand for artificial intelligence and cloud computing platforms has spurred states to dangle incentives in hopes of landing an economic bonanza, but it's also eliciting pushback from lawmakers and communities.",
      "Activity in state legislatures \u2014 and competition for data centers \u2014 has been brisk in recent months, amid an intensifying buildout of the energy-hungry data centers and a search for new sites that was ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Many states are offering financial incentives worth tens of millions of dollars. In some cases, those incentives are winning approval, but only after a fight or efforts to require data centers to pay for their own electricity or meet energy efficiency standards.",
      "Some state lawmakers have contested the incentives in places where a heavy influx of massive data centers has caused friction with neighboring communities. In large part, the fights revolve around the things that tech companies and data center developers seem to most want: large tracts of land, tax breaks and huge volumes of electricity and water.",
      "And their needs are exploding in size: from dozens of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts and from dozens of acres up to hundreds of acres for large-scale data centers sometimes called a hyperscaler.",
      "While critics say data centers employ relatively few people and pack little long-term job-creation punch, their advocates say they require a huge number of construction jobs to build, spend enormous sums on goods and local vendors and generate strong tax revenues for local governments.",
      "In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are writing legislation to fast-track permitting for data centers. The state is viewed as an up-and-coming data center destination, but there is also a sense that Pennsylvania is missing out on billions of dollars in investment that's landing in other states.",
      "\u201cPennsylvania has companies that are interested, we have a labor force that is capable and we have a lot of water and natural gas,\u201d said state Rep. Eric Nelson. \"That\u2019s the winning combination. We just have a bureaucratic process that won\u2019t open its doors.\u201d",
      "Kansas approved a new sales tax exemption on goods to build and equip data centers, while Kentucky and Arkansas expanded pre-existing exemptions so that more projects will qualify.",
      "Michigan approved one that carries some protections, including requirements to use municipal utility water and clean energy, meet energy-efficiency measures and ensure that it pays for its own electricity.",
      "Such tax exemptions are now so widespread \u2014 about three dozen states have some version of it \u2014 that it is viewed as a must-have for a state to compete.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s often a nonstarter if you don\u2019t have them, for at least the hyperscalers,\u201d said Andy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL. \u201cIt\u2019s just such a massive impact on the overall spend of the data center.\u201d",
      "In West Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill to create \u201cmicrogrid\u201d districts free from local zoning and electric rate regulations where data centers can procure power from standalone power plants.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, called the bill his \u201clandmark policy proposal\u201d for 2025 to put West Virginia \u201cin a class of its own to attract new data centers and information technology companies.\u201d",
      "Utah and Oklahoma passed laws to make it easier for data center developers to procure their own power supply without going through the grid while Mississippi rolled out tens of millions of dollars in incentives last year to land a pair of Amazon data centers.",
      "In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster signed legislation earlier this month that eased regulations to speed up power plant construction to meet demand from data centers, including a massive Facebook facility.",
      "The final bill was fought by some lawmakers who say they worried about data centers using disproportionate amounts of water, taking up large tracts of land and forcing regular ratepayers to finance the cost of new power plants.",
      "\u201cI do not like that we\u2019re making customers pay for two power plants when they only need one,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told colleagues during floor debate.",
      "Still, state Sen. Russell Ott suggested that data centers should be viewed like any other electricity customer because they reflect a society that is \u201caddicted\u201d to electricity and are \u201cfilling that need and that desire of what we all want.

      "A single photo sparked a 25-year search in Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- It wasn't going to be easy to track down the woman who came to be known as \u201cMiss Atomic Bomb.\" All Robert Friedrichs had to go on was a stage name he found printed under an archival newspaper photo that showed her posing with other Las Vegas showgirls.",
      "It would take him more than two decades to unravel the mystery of Lee A. Merlin's true identity.",
      "Friedrichs, 81, isn\u2019t a detective. He\u2019s a historian and a retired scientist who got his start during the atomic age, a complicated moment in American history when the line was blurred between fear and fascination with nuclear power.",
      "Between 1951 and 1992, hundreds of nuclear tests were performed, mostly underground, in the desert outside Las Vegas. But it was the massive mushroom clouds from the above-ground nuclear blasts that captured the public\u2019s imagination throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.",
      "Las Vegas sought to capitalize on that craze, and in 1957 sent a photographer out on assignment to shoot a promotional ad for nuclear tourism. He got an idea to capture the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel in a swimsuit in the shape of a fluffy mushroom cloud. In the photo, the high-heeled showgirl is smiling with arms outstretched as the desert unfolds behind her like a stage.",
      "The image played a key role in shaping Las Vegas \u2019 identity as a city of fantasy and spectacle. Yet little was known about the star of the photo \u2014 until now.",
      "Friedrichs first set out to find Miss Atomic Bomb around 2000. The Atomic Museum was set to open in Las Vegas in a few years and as a founding member, he was \u201choping against hope\u201d that she was still alive and could attend the grand opening.",
      "What started as a simple question \u2014 Who was she? \u2014 became an obsession for Friedrichs that outlasted careers and outlived friends.",
      "Friedrichs filled stacks of binders with clues and potential leads, like one that led him \u201cto a guy in South Dakota.\" Days off were spent either combing through online newspaper archives or sifting through special collections at the library.",
      "He tracked down the photographer from that famous photoshoot and interviewed former showgirls who confirmed Miss Atomic Bomb's stage name. But the woman\u2019s real name still eluded him.",
      "Leads dried up and months turned into years.",
      "The mystery didn\u2019t keep him up at night, but he said when he was awake, it consumed his thoughts. He would sometimes stare at the photo, wondering if she\u2019d ever give up the answer.",
      "Then, last winter, something unexpected happened. He gave a talk at the Atomic Museum about his search, and the next day, an audience member sent him a copy of an obituary. A detail stood out: The woman had once been the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel.",
      "Her name was Anna Lee Mahoney.",
      "She was born on Aug. 14, 1927, in the Bronx. Mahoney trained in ballet in New York before performing in shows and musicals under her stage name, Lee A. Merlin.",
      "By 1957, she was the lead dancer at the Sands Hotel\u2019s Copa showroom, a frequent haunt of the Rat Pack and mobsters. She performed for elite audiences, including Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong, according to her obituary.",
      "After hanging up her dancing shoes, Mahoney worked for 30 years as a mental health counselor, moved to Hawaii and got married. She died in 2001 in Santa Cruz, California, after a battle with cancer.",
      "Her photograph is one of the most requested of the 7.5 million images kept in the Las Vegas Convention Center and Visitors Authority\u2019s archive. It has inspired Halloween costumers, and former Playboy Bunny Holly Madison recreated it in 2012. One of the outtakes from the famous shoot appears in the background of an episode of \u201cCrime Story,\u201d a police TV drama set in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just really amazing that one click of the shutter could have such an impact,\u201d Friedrichs said.",
      "A temporary exhibit showcasing the decades-long search opens June 13 at the Atomic Museum.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about Miss Atomic Bomb, about Anna Lee Mahoney,\u201d said Joseph Kent, the museum\u2019s deputy director and curator, \u201cbut it\u2019s also about Robert\u2019s quest to find out her real identity.\u201d",
      "Over the years, the project had become deeply personal for Friedrichs.",
      "He and the photographer, Don English, became fast friends after their first meeting. Before the Atomic Museum opened to the public, Friedrichs took English inside to tour the space. English brought the original camera he used to take the infamous photo.",
      "English posed in the lobby for a photo with a life-sized cardboard cutout of \u201cMiss Atomic Bomb.\u201d Friedrichs jokes it\u2019s his favorite of all the photos he\u2019s collected of her in 25 years.",
      "English died in 2006, long before Friedrichs solved the mystery. Instead he called English\u2019s daughter to share the news.",
      "\u201cShe was really excited that we had gotten this put to bed,\u201d Friedrichs said.",
      "And then there were the showgirls who spent hours talking with Friedrichs. They shared their stage names and stories about vintage Vegas \u2014 fancy dinners, photoshoots and lavish gifts like a beautiful citrine ring that one of them got from a man who wanted to marry her.",
      "The women provided a glimpse into the atomic era, life as Copa showgirls and how they became icons of Las Vegas, yet were sometimes misidentified in photo captions or their names altogether omitted.",
      "And finally, with the help of private investigators who donated their time, Friedrichs uncovered conclusive evidence linking all of Miss Atomic Bomb\u2019s names to a single Social Security number.",
      "\u201cIt's something I always hoped would be completed in my lifetime,\" said Friedrichs, teary-eyed.",
      "His motivation to solve the mystery didn\u2019t come from curiosity alone. The missing name was a gap in the historical record, he said, and he wanted to fix it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like knowing someone was the first president of the United States, but what was his name again?\u201d",

      "The truck hauling an estimated 70,000 pounds (31,751 kilograms) of honeybee hives rolled over around 4 a.m. close to the Canadian border near Lynden, the Whatcom County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in social media posts.",
      "It appears the driver did not navigate a tight turn well enough, causing the trailer to roll into a ditch, county emergency management spokesperson Amy Cloud said in an email. The driver was uninjured, Cloud said.",
      "Deputies, county public works employees and several bee experts responded to the scene. The box hives later came off the truck, and local beekeepers swarmed to help recover, restore and reset the hives, according to the sheriff's office.",
      "The plan is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee in the next day or two, according to the sheriff's office. The goal is to save as many of the bees as possible.",
      "\u201cThank you to the wonderful community of beekeepers: over two dozen showed up to help ensure the rescue of millions of pollinating honey bees would be as successful as possible,\u201d the sheriff's office post said.",

      "The city commissioned the land survey after drawing scrutiny for spending $16,000 to upgrade an area around a grave marker on the property that pays tribute to Confederate soldiers, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.",
      "The stone marker was placed there in 1939 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. It honors more than 100 Confederate soldiers from South Carolina who died in a wartime hospital across the street.",
      "The Richmond Free Press, a newspaper with a large Black readership, first reported on the upgrades, which had included fencing, landscaping and a new bench. The newspaper raised questions about city expenditures on the project in the wake of removing various other Confederate monuments in recent years. Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy.",
      "The city noted the scrutiny in the study, which sought to verify that the land had been used as a cemetery for Confederate soldiers. Using ground penetrating radar and other research methods, the study found that there are more than 472 probable graves and 270 possible graves there, if not more.",
      "The land was originally in the former Richmond suburb of Manchester, which was later encompassed by the city. Manchester bought the land in 1857, possibly for a cemetery, four years before the Civil War started in 1861.",
      "The study included a review of old municipal, hospital and burial records. Newspaper articles from the late 19th century and early 20th century reference people who died in the Civil War being buried there. Maps also show a cemetery existing in that spot in 1876, after the Civil War.",

      "James Talbot, a former Catholic priest convicted of sexually assaulting boys in Maine and Massachusetts after he was exposed by The Boston Globe, has died",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- James Talbot, a former Catholic priest convicted of sexually assaulting boys in Maine and Massachusetts after he was exposed by the investigation that led to the movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d has died. He was 87.",
      "Talbot, a former Jesuit, appeared on a list provided by the religious order of northeastern Jesuits who faced credible allegations of sexual abuse of a minor. Talbot died on Feb. 28 at a hospice center in St. Louis, said Mike Gabriele, a spokesperson for Jesuits USA East.",
      "Talbot was one of the subjects of an investigation into priest sex abuse by The Boston Globe that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 and was adapted into the 2015 movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d The investigation revealed widespread sexual abuse, and coverup of that abuse, within the Catholic Church. Jesuits USA East did not offer a comment about Talbot's death.",
      "He pleaded guilty in 2018 to gross sexual assault and unlawful sexual contact after charges that he sexually abused a 9-year-old boy at a Maine church in the 1990s. He was ordered to serve three years in prison for that conviction.",
      "Prior to the Maine conviction, Talbot spent six years in prison after pleading guilty to raping and sexually assaulting two students in Boston. He has settled lawsuits with more than a dozen victims in addition to the convictions.",
      "Talbot was a former teacher and athletic coach at Boston College High School from 1972 to 1980 who then transferred to Maine. He was at Cheverus High School in Portland, Maine, until 1998.",
      "Former Boston College High School student Jim Scanlan, 63, reported Talbot's abuse in Massachusetts. The Associated Press does not typically use the names of sexual assault victims without their consent, which Scanlan provided. His reports led to criminal charges against Talbot.",
      "Scanlan said he has reached out to other survivors of Talbot's abuse. He said he holds people in positions of power within the church accountable for allowing Talbot to continue committing abuse over many years.",
      "Scanlan said he has tried to move on from his own anger at Talbot, but it's a long process.",
      "\u201cThe opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference,\u201d Scanlan said. \u201cMaybe I just parked him away a long time ago, resolved I couldn't change what happened.\u201d",
      "Jesuits USA East said Talbot had been residing at the Vianney Renewal Center in Dittmer, Missouri, prior to entering hospice care. The center cares for sexually abusive priests as well as providing other health care services.",

      "South Carolina death row inmate Stephen Stanko has chosen to die by lethal injection after his lawyers say he is troubled by what appeared to be a lingering death of the last person in the state who was killed by firing squad",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina death row inmate Stephen Stanko on Friday chose to die by lethal injection after his lawyers said he was troubled by what appeared to be a lingering death of the last person in the state who was killed by a firing squad.",
      "Stanko, who set to die June 13, had a choice among firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair. His lawyers said in previous court filings he didn\u2019t want to suffer what he thought was cooking from thousands of volts of electricity.",
      "They said he was leaning toward the firing squad before questions surfaced about whether Mikal Mahdi suffered agonizing pain for about 45 seconds \u2014 three times longer than expected \u2014 at his April 11 execution after the firing squad nearly missed his heart.",
      "In reviewing autopsy reports, attorneys told him the state's lethal injection protocols appear to send a rush of fluid into the lungs that feels like drowning when a lethal dose of pentobarbital is put into the inmate's veins.",
      "Stanko's lawyers had asked the South Carolina Supreme Court to delay his execution so they could get more information about the firing squad or further investigate any potential problems, but the justices refused their request Wednesday.",
      "Stanko, 57, has been sentenced to death twice in the state for two separate murders \u2014 the killing of a friend and the killing of his girlfriend as he raped her daughter.",
      "South Carolina restarted executions in September after obtaining pentobarbital used in lethal injections thanks to a new secrecy law. The state didn\u2019t execute a prisoner from 2011 to 2024 after its supply of lethal injection drugs expired and pharmacies refused to sell them more unless their identities could be kept secret.",
      "Stanko is being executed for killing his 74-year-old friend Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying, and shot Turner twice while using a pillow as a silencer, authorities said.",
      "Stanko stole Turner\u2019s truck, cleaned out his bank account and spent the next few days in Augusta, Georgia, where he told people in town for the Masters golf tournament that he owned several Hooters restaurants. He stayed with a woman who took him to church. She called police once after seeing his photo and learning that he was wanted, police said.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials.",
      "During Stanko\u2019s execution, he will be strapped to a gurney with his arm outstretched. Medical workers will place an IV in his arm before the curtain is opened to the witness room.",
      "His lawyer can read a final statement and then the execution will start with no announcement. It has typically taken about 20 minutes before a doctor comes in, checks the inmate and declares him dead.",
      "Autopsies done on two of the three previous inmates killed by lethal injection in South Carolina in the past year have shown their lungs filled with massive amounts of fluid. Experts said that is what usually happens when someone is given a massive dose of pentobarbital.",
      "Medical experts hired by the state said the drug knocks the inmate unconscious before they ever feel any other sensation or pain. Witnesses to the executions said inmates don't have any signs of consciousness after about 30 seconds.",
      "Other experts hired by lawyers for the inmates said prisoners may still be able to feel and that the rush of fluid is like drowning.",
      "One of the three inmates killed by lethal injection last year did not choose to have an autopsy for religious reasons.",
      "In the three most recent lethal injection deaths, prison officials have given two large doses of the sedative pentobarbital about 10 minutes apart.",
      "Most other states and the federal government give just one dose of the drug but have a second on hand if needed.",
      "Prison officials have not said why they are giving two doses or whether that is part of their normal procedures, citing a 2023 law that keeps secret the providers of lethal injection drugs, the identities of members of execution teams and the procedures used.",

      "Officials in communities from rural to urban and red to blue have blasted the Trump administration\u2019s recently-published list of \u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Officials in communities from rural to urban and red to blue blasted the Trump administration's list of \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d with many saying they've been outspoken supporters of the president and his stringent immigration policies.",
      "Officials who back President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown questioned how their jurisdictions wound up on a list of more than 500 that the Department of Homeland Security says are obstructing enforcement. Several communities were misspelled, including Cincinnati, which was spelled Cincinnatti.",
      "Jim Davel, administrator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, said the inclusion of his heavily Republican community must be a clerical error.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea how we got on this list whatsoever right at this point,\u201d Davel said. \u201cI think it was just a big mix up, probably some paperwork or something.\"",
      "Meanwhile, those with policies protecting immigrants also pushed back, saying they are doing right by their communities.",
      "\u201cThis is simply the latest attempt by the Trump administration to strong-arm cities like Seattle into changing our local policies through bluster and threats to critical federal funding for public safety and homelessness,\u201d Bruce Harrell, the city's mayor, told The Associated Press in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work \u2014 the law is on our side \u2014 and we will not hesitate to protect our people and stand up for our values.\u201d",
      "The list was published as the Trump administration ramps up efforts to follow through on the president's campaign promises to remove millions of people who are in the country illegally. It came out as Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced major leadership changes, and after a White House official said the administration wanted to drive daily immigration arrests significantly higher.",
      "The administration says each jurisdiction on the list will receive formal notification that the government has deemed them noncompliant and if they\u2019re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.",
      "The list was compiled using a number of factors, including whether the localities identified themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions, how much they complied with federal officials enforcing immigration laws, if they had restrictions on sharing information with immigration enforcement or had any legal protections for people in the country illegally, according to Homeland Security.",
      "But communities said the list doesn't appear to make sense. In California's Orange County, the city of Huntington Beach is on the list even though it has sued the state over its policies that protect immigrants and its City Council supports Trump. But the nearby city of Santa Ana, which has policies to protect members of its sizable immigrant community, is not.",
      "In North Dakota, seven mostly small, rural counties wound up on the list, including Slope County, which has about 700 people and overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2024. County officials reached out to Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong\u2019s office to see what steps to take next, and plan to discuss the matter next week with the county state\u2019s attorney, County Commission Chairman Scott Ouradnik said.",
      "Communities supportive of immigrants said their policies aren't just about immigrants but all residents by ensuring anyone who is a victim or witness feels they can come forward and report crime. States including California, Illinois and Washington, which have such policies, are on the list.",
      "In Hartford, Connecticut, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said the capital city\u2019s laws and policies have enhanced the vibrancy and safety of the community. The city bars people\u2019s immigration status from being used to deny city services and police can't arrest people solely because of immigration status.",
      "\u201cWhile my administration remains laser-focused on real solutions that protect our community, it is clear that current federal policies do not share this commitment to safety and threaten to undermine the gains we have made,\u201d Arulampalam said in a statement.",
      "Nithya Nathan-Pineau, an attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said it\u2019s unclear what criteria were used to formulate the list or define the concept of sanctuary nor what legal action the government plans to take against the jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cIt seems quite arbitrary because not all of these states or specific jurisdictions have a policy that limits cooperation with ICE,\u201d Nathan-Pineau said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that this is another attempt to intimidate and bully.\u201d",
      "There's no clear definition of what a sanctuary jurisdiction is, but the term generally applies to state and local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. It originated in the 1980s with U.S. churches that housed Central Americans who fled civil wars.",
      "Last month, Trump signed an executive order requiring the secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions that they considered to be obstructing federal immigration laws. The list is to be regularly updated.",
      "Federal departments and agencies, working with the Office of Management and Budget, would then be tasked with identifying federal grants or contracts with those states or local jurisdictions that the federal government identified as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d and suspending or terminating the money, according to the executive order.",
      "ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, enforces immigration laws nationwide. The agency often seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding them until those authorities are able to take custody.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Two days away from the start of hurricane season, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state\u2019s top emergency manager joked Friday that they didn't want to encounter each other again until the storm season ends in late November. Forecasts suggest that\u2019s unlikely.",
      "While the upcoming season, which starts Sunday, isn't expected to be as topsy-turvy as last season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there's a 60% chance it will be above normal, a 30% chance near normal and just a 10% chance it will be quieter than average. Relentless storms, including Debby, Helene and Milton, which landed in Florida last year, made for the third-costliest hurricane season on record last year.",
      "\u201cYou just have to prepare and plan that we are going to have impacts,\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference in front of shelves of generators at a Home Depot store in Jupiter, Florida. \u201cIf you plan and it doesn't happen, you're never going to have regrets. If you don't plan and it happens, you're going to immediately be saying, \u2018Why didn\u2019t I do this?'\u201d",
      "Ahead of any hurricanes headed toward the peninsula, Floridians should be prepared to have seven days of food, water and supplies for their households, including pets. If they need to evacuate, they don't have to travel hundreds of miles when traveling just a few miles inland to a hotel or shelter works, officials said.",
      "Floridians living on the coast should be familiar with their evacuation zone so they know which areas emergency officials are referring to if an evacuation is issued, said DeSantis and Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.",
      "The NOAA forecast calls for 13 to 19 named storms with six to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph). A normal season has 14 named storms, seven of which strengthen to hurricanes and three power up further to major hurricanes.",
      "Normally, at the start of hurricane season, Floridians would be able to buy storm supplies under a state program that doesn't tax items like generators, batteries, flashlights, tarps and coolers. However, that is on hold since the Florida Legislature hasn't passed a budget, DeSantis said.",
      "Despite enjoying a GOP supermajority in both chambers, legislative leaders failed to pass the one bill Florida law requires, the state budget, ahead of the scheduled end of the regular session at the beginning of May. Lawmakers are expected to return to Tallahassee in June to hammer out a spending deal ahead of the July 1 start of the next fiscal year.",
      "\u201cSo we don't have any tax holiday in place in the state of Florida,\u201d said DeSantis, taking a jab at lawmakers who openly defied the Republican governor during this past legislative session in contrast to previous years of deference.",

      "A Michigan man who had a key role in building one of the longest bridges in the United States has been buried 15 years after his death after a funeral home near the iconic structure surprised the public by saying it still had his ashes.",
      "Larry Rubin was laid to rest Wednesday in Petoskey, 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the Mackinac Bridge, which connects Michigan's two peninsulas.",
      "For decades, Rubin was the senior staff member at the Mackinac Bridge Authority, which manages the bridge, a 5-mile (8 km) span over the Straits of Mackinac that is considered the third-longest suspension bridge in the U.S. It opened in 1957.",

      "Authorities say a bloodhound picked up Grant Hardin\u2019s scent shortly after prison guards learned that he\u2019d slipped past a gate",
      "A bloodhound picked up the scent shortly after the \u201c Devil in the Ozarks \u201d escaped from a lockup in northern Arkansas. The hound didn't have to go far to begin the hunt \u2014 it lives at the prison as part of a specialized unit that uses man's best friend to help track fugitives.",
      "Although the scent of convicted killer Grant Hardin was lost because of heavy rain, experts say that even days after Sunday's escape, the animal's highly developed sense of small can still pick up a fresh trail.",
      "Bloodhounds are known for being tenacious trackers, said Brian Tierney, president of the National Police Bloodhound Association. They're playing a key role in the search for Hardin, now in its sixth day.",
      "They also save lives, as one young bloodhound did just two weeks ago in Maine. Millie, a 10-month-old hound tracked a 5-year-old girl with autism who went missing from her home on May 16, Maine State Police said. The dog found the girl waist-deep in water in a cedar swamp, the agency said. Authorities credited Millie's dedication and \u201cincredible nose\u201d for saving the girl.",
      "Bad weather confounded the hunt for Hardin, who was serving a 30-year sentence for murder when he escaped from the North Central Unit, a medium-security prison in Calico Rock, Arkansas.",
      "The hound found - then lost - Hardin's scent when heavy rains blew through the area, said state prison spokesman Rand Champion. Hardin was tracked for less than a quarter of a mile when the bloodhound lost the trail. The fugitive could have gone in any direction after that.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the most frustrating things, that they were able to track him but then they lost him because of the rain,\u201d Champion said.",
      "Hardin took almost nothing with him and left behind plenty of clothes, bedsheets and other items that are used to familiarize the bloodhounds with his scent, Champion said. Those items are shared with the dogs to give them the initial scent of the person they are seeking, Tierney said. It\u2019s a process that\u2019s standard operating procedure for Arkansas\u2019 prison dogs.",
      "A former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in a fatal shooting for which he was serving a 30-year sentence.",
      "Hardin\u2019s DNA was matched to the 1997 rape of a teacher at an elementary school in Rogers, north of Fayetteville. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison for that crime. Eventually, his notoriety led to a TV documentary, \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "Champion said that someone should have checked Hardin\u2019s identity before he was allowed to leave, describing the lack of verification as a \u201clapse\u201d that is being investigated.",
      "Authorities haven't disclosed how many dogs are involved in the manhunt, but the Calico Rock prison is known for its bloodhounds that live in a kennel on prison property. The nearly one dozen dogs at the prison have helped many other agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to track a variety of people over the years, according to a 2021 state audit report on the prison.",
      "Southern prisons have a long history of keeping bloodhounds around in case of escapes, like the one featured in country artist Blake Shelton's song \u201cOl' Red,\" about a hound that hunts escaped inmates with \"a nose that could smell a two-day trail.\"",
      "Dogs in Arkansas' prison system have also been used to help other agencies find people who are not dangerous, such as missing children, people with special needs or elderly people, Champion said.",
      "The bloodhounds tend to raise a ruckus when they find their mark. But the prison system uses other types of dogs in searching for children and vulnerable people who go missing, and those dogs tend to lick people and make friends with them when they are found, Champion said.",
      "Fugitives being hunted by bloodhounds have been known to take extreme steps to throw the dogs off their trail, Tierney said.",
      "Two convicted killers who broke out of a maximum-security prison in upstate New York in 2015 collected dozens of containers of black and cayenne pepper before their escape. They had intended to use the pepper \u201cto interfere with tracking dogs they assumed would be part of a manhunt for them after the escape,\u201d a state investigation found. One of the men was shot and killed during the manhunt; another was also shot but survived and was captured.",
      "Tierney said he's heard of other methods used by fugitives to evade tracking dogs. Among them: Sleeping in trees could allow one's scent to disperse before reaching the ground, he said.",

      "After a few months on the job, most shift supervisors concluded that he was \u201cnot suited for police work,\u201d Fayetteville's police chief at the time wrote to the director of the state commission on enforcement standards in the spring of 1991.",

      "Wisconsin communities with fewer than 7,500 people can hand count ballots under a decision by the state elections commission this week",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin communities with fewer than 7,500 people can hand count ballots under a decision by the state elections commission this week.",
      "However, under the Wisconsin Elections Commission decision, those communities and all other Wisconsin towns, villages and cities must still comply with federal law and provide at least one electronic voting machine at a polling location to accommodate voters with disabilities.",
      "The commission's decision Tuesday came in reaction to a complaint against the northwestern Wisconsin town of Thornapple, population about 700, over its decision to hand count ballots in the April 2024 presidential primary or the August state primary. The decision also comes as a federal lawsuit over Thornapple's decision not to have an accessible voting machine continues.",
      "A federal judge in October sided with the U.S. Department of Justice and ruled Thornapple was violating 2002's Help America Vote Act, or HAVA. The judge ordered the town to offer disabled people accessible voting machines. An appeal by the town is pending.",
      "Under the commission's decision this week, communities with fewer than 7,500 people can choose to have no other electronic vote-casting or tabulating machines other than one for disabled voters.",
      "Elections commission staff determined state law makes it optional for communities with fewer than 7,500 people to provide voting machines in every ward in every election. The law says those communities may \u201cadopt and purchase voting machines or electronic voting systems for use in any ward \u2026 at any election.\u201d",
      "Republican commissioner Bob Spindell said the decision will give smaller communities more flexibility, especially in low-turnout local elections. But But Democratic Commissioner Ann Jacobs, who cast the lone no vote, said she worried small communities could game the system by selling voting machines purchased with funding from a state grant and then keep the money.",
      "The complaint against Thornapple was filed by the liberal law firm Law Forward on behalf of two Thornapple residents. A spokesperson for the law firm did not immediately return an email seeking comment Friday. The commission's decision could be appealed to circuit court.",

      "Homeowners eager to sell may have to wait a while before a buyer comes along",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Homeowners eager to sell may have to wait a while before a buyer comes along.",
      "As of April, the U.S. housing market had nearly 34% more sellers than buyers shopping for a home, according to an analysis by Redfin.",
      "Aside from April 2020, when the pandemic brought the economy and home sales activity to a standstill, there haven\u2019t been this few buyers in the market for a home before, based on records that date back to 2013.",
      "The trend is good news for home shoppers \u2014 if they can afford to buy at current mortgage rates and prices, which are still rising nationally, albeit more slowly.",
      "Fewer buyers means less competition for home listings and more pressure on sellers to dial back their asking price and make other concessions to help get a deal done. That's a stark reversal from just a few years ago, when it wasn't uncommon for homeowners to receive offers well above their asking price from multiple home shoppers.",
      "\u201cThe balance of power in the U.S. housing market has shifted toward buyers, but a lot of sellers have yet to see or accept the writing on the wall,\u201d said Asad Khan, a senior economist at Redfin.",
      "The lopsided balance between buyers and sellers is reflected in home sales, which remain in a slump going back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic. Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. Sales fell last month to the slowest pace for the month of April going back to 2009.",
      "Sellers began outnumbering buyers in November 2023, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage climbed to a 23-year high of nearly 8%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The average rate reached 6.89% this week, its highest level since early February.",
      "All told, there were 1.9 million sellers and 1.5 million prospective homebuyers in April, or 490,041 fewer people in the market for a home relative to sellers. A year ago, there were 6.5% more sellers than buyers. Two years ago, buyers outnumbered sellers by 5.3%.",
      "Redfin based its estimate of the number of sellers in April on active listings, or the number of homes for sale at any point during the month. It estimated the pool of people in the market for a home by creating a model that takes several other data into account, including the typical time it takes for a someone to buy after taking a tour of a home.",
      "Faced with a market with fewer potential buyers, some sellers have opted to lower prices or offer sales incentives, such as agreeing to pay for a buyer\u2019s closing costs or other expenses. Nearly 1 in 5 home listings had their price reduced last month, according to Realtor.com.",
      "The growing imbalance between buyers and sellers should pull U.S. home prices 1% lower by the end of this year, according to Redfin.",
      "Prices have already begun to decline in select metro areas. In the four weeks ended April 20, home prices fell in 11 of the top 50 most populous U.S. metro areas, including Dallas, Oakland, California, and Jacksonville, Florida, according to Redfin.",
      "The market with the biggest gap between buyers and sellers is Miami, where sellers outnumber buyers by about 3 to 1, according to Redfin. The strongest seller\u2019s market is Newark, New Jersey, with 47.1% fewer sellers than buyers.",
      "Despite tipping more in favor of buyers, the housing market is likely to remain unaffordable for many Americans. The median U.S. home sales price has jumped 53% over the past six years, far outpacing wage growth.",
      "And while the inventory of previously occupied U.S. homes climbed last month to the highest level since September 2020, it\u2019s still well below pre-pandemic era levels and short on properties that most Americans can afford.",
      "Before the pandemic, households earning $75,000 a year could afford to buy nearly half of all homes on the market nationally. As of March, only 21.2% of home listings were affordable, according to a recent analysis by the National Association of Realtors. A home is considered affordable if monthly payments don\u2019t exceed 30% of household monthly income.",
      "\u201cWithout a significant boost in housing inventory at price points below $260,000, the path to homeownership will remain blocked for millions of Americans who are otherwise financially ready to buy,\u201d according to the NAR report.",

      "The investigation into the shooting continues and more people could be charged, authorities said.",
      "Officials said 120 people partied on the boat over the holiday weekend and were leaving on the dock when the shooting happened. Ten people were wounded by gunfire, mostly on the lower parts of their body, and one person was hurt by a falling speaker, authorities said.",
      "Investigators think only one person fired shots. They didn't say what started the dispute on the boat and how it led to the shooting on the dock and also would not say what kind of weapon was used.",
      "About 3 miles (5 kilometers) down the Intracoastal Waterway, a North Myrtle Beach police officer accidentally shot himself in the leg as he tried to get a boat into the water to respond to the shooting scene, officials said.",

      "Swit died at her home in New York City, her rep, B. Harlan Boll, said in a statement to CBS News on Friday. She was believed to have died of natural causes.",
      "Swit starred on stage and screen, but she was perhaps best known for her long-running role as the head nurse who was a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce on \"M*A*S*H,\" which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983.",
      "The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, a landmark celebrated for its freewheeling humor, its satirical approach to war movies, the excess of blood in the operating room and the nudity of its nurses. The TV series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, was toned down for television but maintained the movie's anti-establishment ethos.",
      "The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital that was the show's setting allowed for doctors burdened by the grueling work to let off steam by playing pranks, telling jokes while performing \"meatball surgery,\" and tussling with patients and Army ranks over such issues as racism, sexism, infidelity and the effects of PTSD among service members.",
      "The large ensemble included Wayne Rogers as Capt. \"Trapper\" John McIntyre, McLean Stevenson as Lt. Col. Henry Blake, Larry Linville as Maj. Frank Burns, and William Christopher as Father Francis Mulcahy. One actor from Altman's film, Gary Burghoff, reprised his role as \"Radar\" O'Reilly, the super-efficient corporal who was the glue that held the hospital together. A new character, Cpl. Max Klinger, played by Jamie Farr, was continually trying to get a Section 8 discharge from the Army for cross-dressing.",
      "Later seasons would feature Mike Farrell as Capt. B.J. Hunnicutt, Harry Morgan as Col. Sherman Potter and David Ogden Stiers as Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester.",
      "Swit won two Emmys for her performances on \"M*A*S*H\" and was nominated eight other times for her work on the show. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes.",
      "As the show developed and incorporated more dramatic plot lines with the comedic ones, Swit wanted to portray Houlihan as more than the \"Hot Lips\" nickname her character was given while having an affair with Linville's Burns.",
      "\"Around the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\" Swit told the author of \"The Complete Book of 'M.A.S.H,'\" Suzy Kalter.",
      "\"To oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn't go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\"",
      "Following the news of her death, Swit was hailed for her work.",
      "\"Loretta Swit's portrayal of Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2013 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy's most enduring roles,\" Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York, said in a statement. \"Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion.\"",
      "In 2003, Swit told Yahoo Entertainment that she would have picked a different ending for her character when the series concluded with Houlihan deciding to return to the U.S. instead of a post in another country.",
      "\"I think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn't agree with that, but that's what they wanted her to do,\" Swit said.",

      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",

Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps.

That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",

      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",

      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",

      "Todd Chrisley made his first public remarks since he and his wife Julie were pardoned by President Donald Trump earlier this week.",
      "Todd and Julie Chrisley were best known for their 10-season USA Today reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best.\" They\u00a0were in prison\u00a0for charges that include bank fraud and tax evasion.",
      "Todd Chrisley, 57, had been serving a 12-year sentence at a minimum-security men's federal prison in Florida. Julie Chrisley, 52, had been serving a seven-year sentence at a federal prison in Kentucky. Both were released on Wednesday, after the pardons from Mr. Trump.",
      "The reality star said that his prosecution had been politically motivated and denied any wrongdoing. He and his daughter Savannah teased the family would return to the screen in a new TV series. The new show will detail the couple's legal battle, Savannah Chrisley said.",
      "\"It's going to give people a look into the trial and things that we went through, and we're going to set the record straight,\" she said Friday.",
      "Cameras for the untitled show \"started filming literally the night that we got home,\" Todd Chrisley said. Savannah Chrisley said the cameras captured her parents' homecoming.",
      "\"You will see the first time he and Mom see each other for the first time,\" Savannah Chrisley said.",
      "Todd Chrisley said he has been relieved to reunite with his wife and family. He said he was able to e-mail his wife from prison and stay in contact with Savannah and their other four children.",
      "\"I woke up the first morning and I was looking around and like, 'This is really real. I'm home,'\" Todd Chrisley said. \"So I was grateful for our family to be all back in the same room, to be together, to share a meal together, to pray together, and to know that we're still in the fight together.\"",
      "Jurors found the reality TV stars had submitted fake bank statements and financial records to receive personal loans. They then used the money to buy luxury cars, designer clothes and real estate. They also concealed the millions they made from their reality show and failed to file tax returns and pay taxes. Julie Chrisley was also convicted of obstruction of justice.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke to the Chrisleys' children on Tuesday, the day before they were officially pardoned. He told them that he believed the Chrisleys received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he does not know the Chrisleys personally. Savannah Chrisley was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention. She also spoke with Mr. Trump's daughter-in-law Laura Trump earlier this month, and compared her family's case to the president's legal troubles.",
      "The Chrisley's law firm said in a statement that the pair sought a presidential pardon by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",

      "Fans have been eagerly awaiting the rerecording of \"Reputation,\" originally released in 2017, for years, but Swift said in her letter that she hasn't even rerecorded a quarter of that album.",
      "\"The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it,\" she wrote. \"To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it.\"",
      "However, she added the unreleased vault tracks \u2014 songs she wrote at the time but were cut from the tracklist \u2014 may be released in the future. She has included songs \"From the Vault\" on each of her rerecorded albums.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The style of Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado (Feb. 8, 1944-May 23, 2025) was marked by rich black-and-white imagery of imperiled nature and impoverished humanity. Though he insisted he was \"just a photographer,\" Salgado's genius was in focusing on real people and the dignity of their toil: miners in Brazil, India and Indonesia; fishermen in the Mediterranean; cane cutters in Cuba; firefighters engaging with oil well conflagrations in Kuwait; slaughterhouse workers in South Dakota.",
      "Born in Aimor\u00e9s, Brazil, Salgado emigrated to France in 1969 while Brazil was under a military dictatorship. In Paris, he dedicated himself to photography. His pictures were distributed by Sygma, Gamma and Magnum, of which he later became president. In 1994 Salgado and his wife founded the Amazonia Images agency to distribute his work.",
      "Salgado's main projects included the \"Amazonia\" series; \"Gold,\" about the extraction of gold from the earth; \"Genesis,\" a tour of the world at its most primordial; and \"Exodus,\" which depicted refugees and migrants.",
      "In 1995, Salgado, overseeing his exhibition titled \"Workers\" at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, described to \"Sunday Morning\" his images that captured men and woman whose labor was being increasingly replaced by mechanized industrialization: \"I believe it's a story of humanity, the way that we work, that we produce, from the beginnings until now \u2026 I believe that all humanity must know about it because if you want to build something for the future, we must know the past, and we must know what's happening at the present moment.\"",
      "In addition to photography, Salgado was also an environmental activist, working to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and founding a nature reserve. He and his wife also created Instituto Terra, which to date has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimor\u00e9s.",
      "Salgado was the subject of the 2014 Oscar-nominated documentary \"The Salt of the Earth,\" co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado."

The theme of \"The White Lotus\" is not far off. Each season of the scripted show is set in a different faraway destination at a fictional White Lotus resort, where the worlds of the often ostentatious guests collide \u2014 in an over-the-top fashion.",

Merlino, who started on Team Goliath, was voted out ninth while White, also originally playing as a Goliath, was runner up.",
      "Each season of \"White Louts\" has a different cast with new plot lines, but White likes to bring people back, surprising the audience with the recurring characters. Merlino's character stayed in Maui. But during Season Two, set in Italy, more \"Survivor\" contestants showed up.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",

      "While Kennedy said in his video announcement\u00a0that healthy pregnant women were also being removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, several pages of agency guidance saying that pregnant women are recommended to get vaccinated because of their higher risk of severe disease remain on the CDC's website as of Friday.",
      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby. The benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" one CDC webpage still reads.",

      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",

      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",
      "The changes come as the CDC's tally of measles cases has begun to show signs of accelerating again.",
      "At least 1,088 cases of measles have been reported so far this year, the CDC said Friday, with two more states \u2014 Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 now reporting their first confirmed cases. Around 90% of confirmed cases are linked to outbreaks within the U.S., not travel outside the country.",
      "A tally of cases backdated by when their symptoms began has climbed for a second straight week, in the agency's preliminary data, after falling from a peak in late March during the height of the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states.",
      "While federal health officials have said that this Southwest outbreak now appears to be slowing, they have warned of the risk of renewed spread driven by travel.",
      "\"This outbreak does appear to be leveling off, but the affected states remain hypervigilant, and that's because it's travel season,\" the CDC's Dr. Manisha Patel, chief medical officer of the agency's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told a webinar published by the American Medical Association on May 15.",

      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

      "\"I was having trouble swallowing,\" she recalled.",
      "Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.",

      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",

      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",

      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",

There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S.

      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",

      "Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry.\u00a0 Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U. S. Steel's electric arc furnaces. The Company is on track to meet its goal of 20% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 goal and has a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\"",

The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.",

EPA has issued three recent Clean Air Act enforcement settlements, which have significantly reduced air emissions. In Burns Harbor, Cleveland Cliffs BOF steel making shop and Phoenix Global slag processing companies and in Gary, the U.S. Steel Gary Works' blast furnace have all decreased particulate matter and metal hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere. Our state partner, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, also conducts inspections and enforcement actions.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced Friday he'll double steel tariffs from 25% to 50% during a visit at a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh area.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",
      "U.S. Steel employs about 22,000 people, with more than 14,000 employees in North America and the rest in Slovakia.",

    "summary": "Higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic in Las Vegas, but casual trips are down.",
    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",
      "\"Las Vegas is gonna respond to this,\" Hill said. \"We are going to have a great summer.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

    "story": [
      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",
      "Aldi's Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies, for example, come in a red box, similar to that of Mondelez's Nutter Butter cookies. The white script font and cookie image on the packaging also mimic the Nutter Butter packaging, the snack company claims.",
      "Aldi also sells a product called Thin Wheat, which in addition to the nearly synonymous name to Nabisco's Wheat Thins, has a similar design to the Mondelez product, including a yellow background, the word \"original\" and crackers pictured on the bottom half of the box, the lawsuit says.",
      "The trademark lawsuit is not the first for Aldi, which been called out numerous times over its products' packaging. Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",
      "Mondelez is one of the worlds largest multinational food companies, with a footprint in over 150 countries. Aldi, a U.S.-based company, operates 6,600 stores across more than 10 countries, according to its website.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 16:04:33 -0400",
    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

    "summary": "Counselors are urging foreign students applying to U.S. colleges to avoid certain topics online as the State Department scrutinizes their social media.",
    "story": [
      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

    "summary": "Prices and finances are big factors in how Americans decide their summer plans.",
    "story": [
      "Summer begins with Americans' economy ratings continuing to get a bit brighter than they were this winter \u2014 though still not good \u2014 with their outlook more mixed. But feelings of financial concern and stress are more prevalent than feelings of being secure.",
      "With a big majority still saying their incomes don't keep pace with inflation, prices and finances of course play a big role in how Americans decide what their summer plans will be. And that, too, helps define two different outlooks heading into the season.",
      "Slightly more Americans say they'll take a vacation this summer than report taking one in 2024. Most likely to take a vacation are the just-over half who say they're at least doing OK financially and can keep up with expenses. (For the higher income earners among them especially, summer will also involve travel.)",
      "But for those who say their finances are not good, it continues to be largely because of prices and incomes not keeping up with inflation. They're largely forgoing any vacation or travel.",
      "In all, feelings about finances span a range and most report feeling things from stress and concern to security and optimism at least once in a while. But Americans describe feeling concern or stress even more often these days, rather than feeling secure or content. That's especially the case among those whose personal financial situation isn't good.",
      "Ratings of the economy remain net-negative overall \u2014 this has been the case for years \u2014 but lately they have been ticking up off the dips they saw in late winter, February and March.",
      "Outlook and direction remains mixed, and with more negativity than positivity. But relatively fewer today are planning as if the country is headed for outright recession, as said so last month; opinion has shifted toward expectations of a slowdown, but not recession.",
      "In a different study consumer confidence was also reported to have rebounded lately.",
      "Those in comparably lower income levels report feeling stress about finances more often. Stress and concern go up with feeling less secure in a job (for those employed.) Concern about monthly ability to pay for food and groceries is strongly associated with more frequent feelings of stress. Conversely, feelings of being secure or optimistic financially are linked to confidence in being able to save, buy extras and pay for the basics.",
      "People for whom the stock market matters to their finances report less frequent feelings of stress. The market has had volatility over recent months, but those invested also have higher incomes, and report less concern about paying for day to day items to begin with.",
      "Summer plans",
      "As summer begins, one way Americans traditionally try to alleviate stress, of course, is a vacation or getaway. But access to that, too, splits on financial lines.",
      "For the just over half of Americans who say their financial situation is good, most plan to take a vacation of some form this summer, and most of those will also involve travel.",
      "Large majorities, often even if their finances are ok, say their incomes are not keeping pace with inflation, and this generally hasn't changed over time.",
      "For the bulk of people who do travel, summer means a road trip. It's far and away the main way they'll travel. (Though on balance, people who say their financial situation is bad say they'll take fewer car trips than last summer.)",
      "Peoples' assessment of the direction of gas prices is mixed and not very different than it was in March.",
      "Americans are more likely to expect their summer to be exciting rather than boring. And yet, for all the attention it gets, summer doesn't rate as Americans' favorite season. That's fall.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,216\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between May 26-29, 2025.

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. Its order said that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay, and gave the plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to respond to the administration.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. The trade court decision could provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil. However, the federal appeal's decision on Thursday to reinstate the duties adds more uncertainty over tariffs.",
      "As the Trump administration's appeal works its way through the courts, it's unclear whether business should ultimately plan for relief if the trade court's ruling stands, or whether the tariffs might stick. And Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "With the temporary stay imposed by the appeals court, all of his tariffs are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 still in effect.",
      "But the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration had other tariff measures available that would take a few months to put in place. He added, \"But we're not planning on pursuing those right now because we are confident this ruling is incorrect,\" Hassett said.",
      "What about other lawsuits targeting the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are being challenged in a number of other lawsuits, including one filed by a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources. Its CEO, Rick Woldenberg, had told CBS MoneyWatch in April that he was suing because he believed the tariffs would prove catastrophic, both for his business and the U.S. economy.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Learning Resources, writing in his decision that the IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs.\" The judge also blocked the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from the toy maker and its sibling business, hand2mind, writing that the companies were likely to suffer \"significant and unrecoverable losses.\"",
      "Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday that while the court's decision was \"gratifying,\" he's still facing uncertainty over the ongoing threat of tariffs because he expects the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.",
      "\"There is going to be a lot of dust in the air for the next two weeks as 'emergency this' and 'emergency that' are filed all over the place,\" he said. \"For things to change in our business, we need some certainty on our costs.\"",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. If the trade court's decision is upheld, the effective tariff rate will ultimately be lowered, although it would still be significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics on Thursday, after the trade court's ruling but before the appeals court said the tariffs could remain in place temporarily.",
      "\"I hope this is a process that will lead to certainty,\" Learning Resources CEO Woldenberg said about the two court rulings. But, he added, \"until I know if it's going to stick, I can't plan around not paying the tariffs.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",

      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",

      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loans-credit-scores-plunge/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 15:41:02 -0400",
    "summary": "New delinquency reports will hurt the credit scores of borrowers who fail to make payments on their student loans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's resumption of student loan payments earlier this month is taking a toll on many borrowers' credit records.",
      "Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers from January through March of 2025, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For its report, the Fed looked at a borrower delinquency rate based on shares of student loan borrowers with at least one student loan reported as past due or in default.",
      "Another 1 million borrowers experienced credit score drops of at least 150 points for the first three months of 2025. A low credit score makes securing future loans both more difficult and more costly, pushing milestones like buying a home, or saving for retirement, further out of reach. It can even impact one's employment prospects.",
      "\"The key risk is that this could lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans, which could reduce delinquent borrowers' access to credit, which would then be used for other areas of spending such as on cars and mortgages,\" Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some 2.4 million of the newly delinquent borrowers previously had credit scores above 620, which are considered good and would have allowed them to qualify for new car loans, mortgages and credit cards before the delinquencies were reported, Fed researchers said.",
      "\"These borrowers saw substantial declines in their credit standing in the first quarter and will now face steeper borrowing costs or denial for new credit,\" Fed researchers said in the report.",
      "Grace period expires",
      "Student loan repayments were paused at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by President Trump in March 2020, during his first term. After multiple extensions of the payment pause by former President Biden, repayments resumed in October 2023.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education then instituted a 12-month \"on ramp\" period which expired in October 2024, to give student borrowers some leniency as they resumed payments. During the transition period, loan servicers did not report missed payments or delinquent loans to credit bureaus, protecting many student borrowers from the worst consequences of not making their payments. Borrowers are considered delinquent on their loans when a payment is more than 90 days late.",
      "The pandemic-era pause on repayment had a positive effect on borrowers' credit scores: Between 2019 and 2024, the number of borrowers with credit scores below 620 fell by more than 4 million, as borrowers moved into higher credit score brackets, an analysis from Oxford economics shows.",
      "With that grace period having ended on May 5, newly delinquent student borrowers' credit scores are also being dinged, as their failures to pay back their debts are reported to credit bureaus.",
      "\"Borrowers receiving a new delinquency will see a drop in their credit score. This may signal a reversal of the positive credit score trend seen during the pandemic, which would lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in a report.",
      "Long-lasting consequences",
      "Substantial drops in delinquent student borrowers' credit scores will have long-lasting ramifications for those affected, including lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans and limited access to credit in general, according to experts.",
      "\"The long-term issue is they'll have trouble accessing other types of loans in the future, like mortgage and car loans. It's easier to build credit scores when you don't have negative data, but when you have a delinquency, it's hard to come out of that. It takes a lot of effort,\" Tushar Bagamane, CEO of budgeting tool Vola Finance, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Consumers with multiple delinquencies report having to pay \"exorbitantly high on interest\" on larger loans once a delinquency impacts their credit score, Bagamane said.",
      "\"They have to pay more on their home loans and the cost of those lines of credit affects the income they have left after meeting their essential needs,\" he said. \"The ability to refinance existing loans with a low credit score can be prohibitively expensive and at that point, borrowers are almost left outside the financial system.\"",
      "By that he means they can't achieve milestones like owning a home or acquiring other assets, \"which is not a good position to be in,\" Bagamane added.",
      "American dream increasingly out of sight",
      "Zwemmer, of Oxford Economics, noted that a delinquency remains on one's credit report for seven years, and so avoiding becoming delinquent on a loan in the first place is the best course of action. If millions of student borrowers drop into lower credit score brackets, it could exacerbate the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans.",
      "\"Older and lower-income segments of the population will be most impacted, so we'll be looking to see if there's a further bifurcation of U.S. consumers,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "Jason Ackerman, a certified public accountant and co-founder of WealthRabbit, a retirement planning platform, said that as their credit scores drop, those who can least afford to shoulder higher borrowing costs will see their rates rise.",
      "\"Younger people are getting further behind on the American dream of buying a house and saving for retirement,\" Ackerman told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Their payments get higher \u2014 and the more you're putting toward student loans, the less you can put toward other things.\"",

      "The meeting, held at Mr. Trump's invitation, comes after the president has repeatedly pressed Mr. Powell to lower the Fed's benchmark rate. Mr. Trump earlier this month called Mr. Powell a \"fool\" for acting \"too late\" in cutting rates.",

      "He also stressed that monetary policy will support \"maximum employment and stable prices,\" referring to the Fed's dual mandate of keeping unemployment and inflation low.",
      "At a press conference earlier this month, Powell emphasized that he's never requested a meeting with a U.S. president, and never would.",
      "\"I wouldn't do that,\" he said. \"There's never a reason for me to ask for a meeting; it's always been the other way.\" Mr. Trump had not requested that they meet, Powell said at the time.",
      "The meeting comes as ongoing tariff uncertainty clouds business and investment decisions. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs are illegal. However, the president is expected to keep pushing tariffs, which are already having an inflationary effect, as retailers raise consumer prices to offset added costs they are facing.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on Powell to lower interest rates and even threatened to remove him from his post, writing in an April 17 social media post that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "Powell has previously underlined the Fed's historical political independence, noting in December that the central bank's job is to make decisions based on economic data without regard to the views of elected officials.",

We are working to quickly and securely restore operations.\"",
      "Victoria's Secret also didn't specify when it first identified the issue and began pulling back services. Most media reports of the retailer's website going dark emerged Wednesday \u2014 when the company also shared an update on social media \u2014 but some frustrated customers online said they began experiencing issues earlier in the week, as far back as Monday.",
      "An FAQ on the corporate site for Victoria's Secret notes that the company doesn't have an estimate for when its site will be back up. Its customer care services were also offline as of Wednesday night.",
      "The company added that it is trying to fulfill orders placed before Monday and that it would be extending return windows and some direct mail coupon offers for impacted customers in the U.S.",

      "Shares for Victoria's Secret tumbled about 4% as of midday Thursday.",
      "While not confirmed by the company, the \"security incident\" impacting Victoria's Secret's operations bears all the hallmarks of a cyberattack. And it arrives as more and more companies report breaches that disrupt operations and/or expose customer data.",
      "Last week, for example, Adidas announced that it had recently become aware of an \"unauthorized external party\" obtaining some consumer data \u2014 mostly consisting of contact information \u2014 through a third-party customer service provider. The German shoe and clothing company said it would be informing impacted customers and working with law enforcement.",
      "And several British retailers \u2014 Marks & Spencer, Harrods and Co-op \u2014 have all shared that they've been targeted by cyberattacks over recent weeks. The cyberattack hitting M&S stopped it from processing online orders and left store shelves empty, with the company estimating that this will cost it 300 million pounds ($400 million).",
      "And following any cybersecurity incident impacting a consumer-facing brand, experts warn that it's important for shoppers to be alert. Fraudsters might promise fake promotions through phishing emails, for example, or use sensitive information that may have been compromised.",

      "What were the Chrisleys convicted of?",
      "The pair were indicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in loans, with a federal jury convicting them in June 2022. The couple was also convicted of conspiring to defraud the IRS, along with additional tax crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of Georgia said at the time.",
      "The jury found that the couple submitted fake bank statements and other financial records to obtain personal loans, which they then used to buy luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "\"After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in 2022 after their conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, the couple concealed their income from their reality TV show from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The Chrisleys also failed to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "\"These convictions should send a clear message regardless of your fame or notoriety, everyone will be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes,\" said James E. Dorsey, special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, in a statement\u00a0on the Chrisley's convictions.",
      "Why did Trump pardon the Chrisleys?",
      "In a call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\" He added that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.",
      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has canceled $766 million awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.",
      "The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.",
      "The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.",
      "The new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",
      "He added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"",
      "Dr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... \u00a0If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"",
      "H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.",
      "Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.",
      "Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

    "summary": "A new term is popping up on Wall Street called \"TACO,\" which stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" The President says \"it's called negotiation.\"",
    "story": [
      "A new acronym is popping up on Wall Street to explain investors' reaction to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs: TACO.",
      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces, noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for a $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 a week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

      "In recent days, Musk has criticized parts of Mr. Trump's agenda. He told CBS News earlier this week he has some \"differences of opinion\" with the administration, and feels \"a little stuck in a bind\" when he disagrees.

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

    "summary": "President Trump said that Elon Musk \"will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\" Musk's tenure as a \"special government employee\" is formally ending.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency as the billionaire's tenure as a \"special government employee\" comes to an end, saying his work \"has been without comparison in modern history.\"",
      "\"He's one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced,\" the president said, with Musk standing next to him. \"He stepped forward to put his very great talents into the service of our nation, and we appreciate it.\"",
      "The president said that through his work with DOGE, his cost-cutting task force, Musk and his team have overhauled the work of the federal government, calling it \"the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations.\"",
      "But while Musk came into the second Trump administration with a lofty promise of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget \u2014 and even wielded a \"chainsaw for bureaucracy\" on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February \u2014 he leaves with a tally falling far short of that goal. The White House has said that DOGE's government-slashing efforts have saved roughly $170 billion in spending, but the initiative's \"wall of receipts\" documenting spending cuts\u00a0contained a number of errors\u00a0and miscalculations.",
      "And an analysis from the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service estimated that DOGE's actions could actually\u00a0cost the government $135 billion\u00a0as a result of lost productivity and changes in the status of federal workers. Some have been\u00a0mistakenly fired, only to be rehired again.",
      "As a special government employee, Musk was limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period, and May 30 was his 130th day. But Mr. Trump indicated Musk will remain involved.",
      "\"Many of the DOGE people\" are staying on, Mr. Trump said, \"And Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling. It's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things.\"",
      "During the Oval Office meeting, Mr. Trump also praised a recent,\u00a0temporary decision\u00a0from a federal appeals court that reinstated most of his tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law. A three-judge U.S. trade court panel unanimously ruled Wednesday that the 10% tariffs, levied against nearly every U.S. trading partner, were an\u00a0unlawful exercise of the president's authority. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily halted that decision while it takes more time to consider an appeal by the Justice Department.",
      "\"The tariffs are so important, and that's why we were so happy with the decision yesterday where the tariffs continued, because without the tariffs, our nation would be in peril,\" he said.",
      "Earlier this week, Musk announced on X, the social media site he owns, that he would be finishing his time at the White House and thanked Mr. Trump for \"the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" an initiative led by DOGE. He predicted DOGE's mission \"will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout government.\"",
      "The president had confirmed on social media that Musk's last day would be Friday but added the caveat that \"he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\" A senior administration official said Musk was set to begin his offboarding process Wednesday night. His departure marks his return to the private sector.",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration is \"committed\" to making the cuts made by DOGE permanent and will seek codification by Congress.",
      "In his time serving as a senior adviser to the president and leading DOGE, Musk roiled Washington through his team's unsparing cuts to the federal workforce, cancellation of billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts, and dismantling of several agencies, even if some of those actions have been blocked by the courts.",
      "DOGE's cuts have reverberated far outside the nation's capital, with food banks, nonprofit organizations and child abuse prevention programs, among others, impacted. Aid organizations warned earlier this year that the administration's slashing of foreign aid from the U.S. Agency for International Development threatened to exacerbate the devastating famine in Sudan.",
      "Musk, speaking in the Oval Office, defended DOGE's work and when pressed on the cuts the task force identified, said he expects it will achieve the $1 trillion goal he touted \"over time.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time,\" he said. For his Oval Office appearance, the Tesla CEO wore a DOGE baseball cap and black blazer over a \"DOGEfather\" t shirt. He also had a black eye and explained that while \"horsing around,\" his 5-year-old son had punched him in the face.",
      "Musk said he would continue visiting the White House and serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president.",
      "His time has been punctuated by a series of events that showcased his closeness with the president. He participated in Cabinet meetings at the White House, traveled on Air Force One with Mr. Trump and, joined by his son \"Lil X,\" addressed reporters in the Oval Office.",
      "The president also showcased Tesla vehicles on the driveway at the White House and said he'd purchase a red Model S. He\u00a0praised Musk during his joint address to Congress earlier this year for his work heading DOGE.",
      "But Musk has in recent days publicly split from Mr. Trump over his sweeping domestic policy package, which the president calls his \"big beautiful bill,\" that passed the House last week.",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said during an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" which will air on June 1.",
      "An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the tax provisions of the package, called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034.",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Transgender military service members must come forward and voluntarily leave active-duty service next week, by June 6, according to Defense Department\u00a0guidance issued by Secretary Pete Hegseth. After that, the military is expected to begin involuntary separations for active-duty trans service members who remain.",
      "One of the service branches, the Army, on Wednesday issued more guidance about how it will identify and interact with soldiers with gender dysphoria, according to documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "Although Hegseth had made formal assurances in a February memo that transgender service members would be treated with dignity, the Army's new internal directives to units instruct personnel to intentionally address transgender troops \u2014 even superior officers \u2014 in accordance with an individual's medical assignment at birth rather than by their preferred pronoun.",
      "When the military starts forcing out transgender troops through involuntary separations, soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria following a list of criteria outlined in the guidance. The markers include past requests for grooming standard exemptions tied to medical assignment at birth or the initiation of a medical treatment plan tied to gender dysphoria. \"Overt conduct,\" either on social media or in person, of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth and even a commander's \"private conversation\" where a soldier disclosed gender dysphoria are considered relevant under the guidance.",
      "The commander is expected to initiate a medical record review if aware of any of the criteria above, and service members will also be asked during routine medical check-ups about their identity as a result of the Defense Department's new policy.",
      "In a February\u00a0memo filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said transgender troops will be \"treated with dignity and respect.\" But in public, the Army veteran and former Fox News host has instead railed against transgender service members,\u00a0saying at a Special Operations Forces military conference in Florida in May, \"No more dudes in dresses, we're done with that s***.\"",
      "The Army guidance also instructs soldiers to use the \"utmost professionalism and treating all individuals with dignity and respect,\" but the policies run counter to transgender social norms, like addressing transgender troops by the pronouns they prefer.",
      "Army\u00a0Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer and Afghanistan veteran with 17 years of military service, now faces separation from the armed forces. She defended the service of transgender troops when contacted Friday by CBS News.",
      "\"By implementing this guidance\u2026you're making it worse than the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, because you're overtly hunting down and trying to identify transgender service members or anybody that\u2026exhibits symptoms of gender dysphoria,\" Corcoran said.",
      "She added: \"Transgender service members have served openly since 2016 without adverse impacts on readiness or unit cohesion. Thousands of transgender troops are combat-tested, having deployed to war zones and executed missions with distincction.\"",
      "The Defense Department defines gender dysphoria as a \"marked incongruence between an individual's experienced or expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least six months, as manifested by conditions causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\"",
      "The Army guidance issued to units on Wednesday begins with the suggestion that identifying with a gender different from one's sex assigned at birth is at odds with the values of truthfulness and discipline expected of service members \u2014 even beyond the uniform they wear. The guidance echoes the statements in President Trump's January\u00a0executive order stating the values of transgender service members represent a departure from the \"humility and selflessness required\" of military members and are \"inconsistent with\" the \"cohesion\" the armed forces demand.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Thursday, an Army spokesperson at the Pentagon said that since May 8, additional guidance has been issued as the service continues to voluntarily separate service members.",
      "When asked about soldiers being directed to misgender transgender soldiers, the Army spokesman, who did not want to be identified while speaking on behalf of the service, repeated what was in the guidance obtained by CBS News: \"Pronoun usage when referring to Soldiers must reflect their biological sex. In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\") must also reflect an individual's biological sex.\"",
      "The Army spokesman added, \"The Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered to serve our great nation. We are in the process of ensuring the Army is aligned with recent policy changes to Soldier requirements. Regardless of potential outcomes, every Soldier will be treated with dignity and respect.\"",
      "Commanders have also been instructed to revise official records to reflect service members' sex at birth, rather than their gender identity. In the interim, transgender troops are expected to comply with policies aligned with biological sex\u2014ranging from physical fitness standards to uniform requirements, sleeping quarters and access to restrooms and showers.",
      "Under current policy, decisions to separate soldiers outside standard regulatory grounds rest solely with the secretary of the Army \u2014 a power typically reserved for exceptional circumstances. Enlisted transgender soldiers will be separated under the Secretarial Plenary Authority, a mechanism the Army itself\u00a0acknowledges is \"exercised sparingly.\" Historically, this little used authority has surfaced during politically fraught chapters of military policy \u2014 from discharges over COVID-19 mandate refusals to the now-defunct \"Don't ask, Don't Tell\" era.",
      "While both enlisted and officer transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge unless their service warrants a lower characterization, they will also receive an RE-3 enlistment code, meaning they are not eligible to rejoin the Army or any other U.S. military service without a waiver.",
      "Army military officers will be separated on the basis that \"their continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\" CBS News has not yet seen directives from the other service branches and whether they mirror the Army's policies.",
      "Under the Army guidance obtained by CBS News, transgender officers will receive what's known as a \"Code JDK\" upon separation. The JDK code is for the Military Personnel Security Program, and is typically applied to discharge paperwork where a service member is being separated from the U.S. military for a security reason.",
      "Cody Harnish, a former Army Judge Advocate General officer and now a private defense attorney for U.S. service members, told CBS News by phone on Thursday that a JDK separation code is a red flag and signals to other government agencies that the service members were separated for \"national security interests.\"",
      "\"This can be a serious roadblock to keeping or transferring a security clearance to future employment requiring a clearance,\" said Harnish. He said under President Trump's executive order revoking gender identity discrimination protections, if a transgender veteran's separation from the military bears this code and is vetted for a job requiring a security clearance,\u00a0\"being transgender can again be viewed as a security concern.\"",
      "Harnish said that having the JDK separation code on their record may be interpreted by future employers \"as evidence of heightened risk, severely complicating or blocking clearance maintenance or transfer after military service.\"",
      "But amid the crackdown and political rhetoric surrounding the service of transgender service members, Maj. Corcoran offered a pointed reflection on patriotism, duty, and shared sacrifice.",
      "\"It's simple, we transgender service members believe in the same American values you do\u2014liberty and freedom,\" said Corcoran. \"The nation's strength comes together for a common purpose in the face of the ever-increasing hostile global environment. It is in the blood of the warrior spirit that we all stand ready to fight, and if need be, die in the defense of the cherished institutions of America. Let us embody this by serving.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",

      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "NOTUS on Thursday found seven of the studies cited appear never to have been published. An author of one of the studies said while she did conduct research on anxiety in children, she did not author the report that was listed in the MAHA report. Some studies were also misinterpreted in the report. The problematic citations were on topics around children's screen time, medication use and anxiety.",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials had already raised a number of issues with the report, which they said misstated several facts and left out already well-documented drivers known to be causing chronic disease in children that health authorities are already working to address.",
      "The report described growing rates of several health issues, including childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, cancer, allergies and autoimmune disorders. It blamed poor diet and ultra-processed foods, lack of physical activity, chronic stress and too many prescriptions and vaccines for children's health disorders.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked by reporters about the nonexistent studies Thursday and said the report would be updated.",
      "\"I understand there was some formatting issues with the MAHA report that are being addressed and the report will be updated,\" Leavitt said during the White House briefing. \"But it does not negate the substance of the report, which, as you know, is one of the most transformative health reports that has ever been released by the federal government.\"",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder disputed the idea that the errors were just a matter of \"formatting,\" calling it \"not just sloppiness but really unethical behavior.\"",

    "story": [
      "PBS on Friday sued President Trump and his administration over an executive order signed earlier this month that seeks to cut funding to the public TV network and NPR.",
      "The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., and comes days after NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations separately sued the Trump administration over the same executive order. Both PBS headquarters and a northern Minnesota PBS station are plaintiffs in Friday's case.",
      "Lawyers for PBS said the executive order is \"blatant viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of PBS and PBS Member Stations' private editorial discretion,\" and is a violation of the First Amendment and parts of the Public Broadcasting Act, which was passed in 1967. The suit argues that Mr. Trump does not have the authority to block federal funding to the public TV stations over their news coverage.",
      "\"The EO makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech,\" the complaint says. \"The EO smacks of retaliation for, among other things, perceived political slights in news coverage.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of government funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. The executive order dictates that the government \"shall cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, consistent with my Administration's policy to ensure that Federal funding does not support biased and partisan news coverage.\"",
      "The order also says indirect government funding should be cut off, including funding to local stations that later reaches the national networks.",
      "If the executive order is allowed to stand, the PBS complaint says, \"it would have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS Member Stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said: \"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime. Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS.\"",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting also sued Mr. Trump recently over his attempts to fire three members of its five-member board, arguing that the president was exceeding his authority.",
      "PBS CEO Paula Kerger said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that public broadcasters had \"never seen a circumstance like this\" and said the Trump administration was \"coming after us on many different ways.\"",
      "Kerger said the executive order was just one way the administration was targeting public media. She said a possible rescission of already appropriated funds, and an effort to challenge sponsorships from corporations through the Federal Communications Commission, among other things, were possible.",
      "\"Obviously we're going to be pushing back very hard, because what's at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations, across the country,\" Kerger said.",
      "She added that PBS only gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, but that some smaller stations receive up to 50% of their funding from federal sources and added the risks to the smaller stations are \"existential\" if the funding is cut.",

      "The United States and Israel are waiting for\u00a0Hamas\u00a0to respond to a 60-day\u00a0Gaza ceasefire\u00a0proposal, the White House said Thursday.",
      "Israel signed off on a proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump submitted, and it's been sent to Hamas, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "During the proposed 60-day ceasefire, a draft of the deal obtained by CBS News indicated that Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Five living hostages and nine deceased from the \"list of 58\" remaining hostages would be released on the first day of the agreement, while a second group would be released on the seventh day, according to the document.",
      "According to the document, humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal, and it will be distributed through \"agreed upon channels that will include the United Nations and Red Crescent.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that special envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home.\"",
      "Leavitt said Hamas hasn't accepted the deal, to her knowledge, but if there is a deal, the public will hear so directly from her, Witkoff or the president himself.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement Thursday that the proposal \"fails to meet any of our people's demands, foremost among them an end to the war and famine,\" but the \"movement's leadership is studying the response with full national responsibility, in light of the genocide our people are facing.\"",
      "A senior Hamas figure closely involved in negotiations told CBS News they are studying the proposal and don't feel there are a lot of options. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel is not going to attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire, the senior Hamas figure said.",
      "The proposal obtained by CBS News outlines that all Israeli offensive military activities in Gaza will cease once the deal is agreed upon, and that during the 60 days, there will be a cessation of aerial movement in the Gaza Strip for 10 hours daily, or 12 hours daily when the exchange of hostages and prisoners take place.",
      "Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would begin on the first day of the agreement and would include discussing the exchange of the remaining hostages, issues relating to redeployment and withdrawals of Israeli forces, and long-term security within Gaza.",
      "President Trump, who on Friday told reporters in the Oval Office that they are \"very close to an agreement on Gaza,\" will personally announce the ceasefire agreement, the proposal says.",
      "A source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas tells CBS News that a deal is close, and once a response is received, it will be transmitted directly to Mr. Trump and Witkoff.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to still be alive, out of about 250 who were taken during the group's terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest have either been released during earlier pauses in fighting or have been confirmed dead.",
      "An earlier two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas\u00a0ended in March\u00a0after the two sides failed to agree on terms for extending it, and Israel resumed strikes on the Gaza Strip. During that temporary truce, dozens of hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for Israel freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0he was open to a temporary ceasefire deal to release more hostages, but \"there will be no way we will stop the war\" until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Since then, about 54,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.",
      "Aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip\u00a0resumed earlier this month\u00a0after a more than two-month blockade. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid group,\u00a0began distributing food\u00a0this week.",

      "In a letter to newly appointed pardon attorney Ed Martin, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland asked Martin to \"explain the criteria and process\" he and his office have used to vet recent pardons by Mr. Trump.",
      "Dozens of people were pardoned this week, including a number of convicted fraudsters, adding to a series of pardons for convicted white-collar criminals in his second term. In some cases, the administration has said pardon recipients were unfairly targeted for being Trump supporters.",
      "This week's pardon recipients include reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, convicted on bank fraud and tax evasion charges; former Rep. Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and related charges; and former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins, convicted on fraud and bribery charges. Trump also commuted the sentence of one of Chicago's most infamous gangsters and a rapper convicted of felony gun charges.",
      "Some pardon recipients this term \u2014 and their family members \u2014 have expressed support for Mr. Trump. Electric truck entrepreneur Trevor Milton, who was pardoned on securities fraud charges, donated hundreds of thousands to a pro-Trump committee last year. And the mother of Paul Walczak, who was pardoned last month on tax charges, has helped raise money for Mr. Trump and recently attended a $1 million-a-plate fundraiser, The New York Times reported.",
      "Raskin wrote in his letter that \"it at least appears that you are using the Office of the Pardon Attorney to dole out pardons as favors to the President's loyal political followers and most generous donors, completely ignoring and abandoning the thousands of individual applications for clemency in the normal process.\"",
      "Typically, pardon applications are submitted by those seeking reprieve to the U.S. pardon attorney's office for a review on the merits of their case. Pardon decisions are ultimately up to the president, but in the past, the Justice Department has said it weighs whether an applicant has taken responsibility for their actions and waited at least five years since their conviction or release from prison, among other factors.",
      "\"None of the cases you have recommended to date appears to have satisfied these standards. Instead, it appears the Administration has abruptly changed the criteria for granting presidential pardons and commutations,\" Raskin continued.",
      "\"The new criteria for granting pardons appear to be: showing absolute personal and political loyalty to President Trump; giving substantial financial contributions to MAGA and the President's political network; and engaging in forms of political corruption and violence that promote MAGA power and authoritarianism,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "When asked about Raskin's letter, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News, \"I assume Raskin must have also sent a letter to Biden's family after receiving blanket pardons?\" The spokesperson also included a snippet from a CNN interview with Raskin in which he declined to specify whether he supports former President Joe Biden pardoning his son Hunter.",
      "The president's power to pardon people for federal crimes \u2014 granted by the Constitution \u2014 is virtually limitless. Mr. Trump has used his pardoning power extensively in this term, drawing criticism for giving out pardons to virtually all those convicted of crimes during the Jan. 6 riot.",
      "In addition to the pardons already finalized, Mr. Trump said he would \"take a look at\" pardoning a group of men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer when pressed by reporters this week. Martin has discussed pardon applications for some of the only remaining Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants who weren't given full clemency by Mr. Trump, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes.",
      "Mr. Trump moved Martin to the Justice Department as associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney after he failed to gain enough support in the Senate needed for confirmation as U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C. The key role of pardon attorney typically advises the president on how to use his clemency power.",
      "The president said Martin will also serve as director of the Justice Department's \"Weaponization Working Group,\" a committee formed by Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"review\" the department's Biden-era activities, including its investigations into Mr. Trump, Capitol rioters and others.",
      "In a post on X this week, Martin wrote \"No MAGA left behind\" about the ongoing slate of pardons.",

      "Manger, who took charge of the department in the difficult months after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol siege, quantified the surge in threats targeting lawmakers and how the department has had to evolve to expand its protection of senators and House members.",
      "Leaning forward in his seat to emphasize his point, Manger said, \"It's a huge responsibility. We've gone from 1,000 to 2,000 threats a year to now 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 threats a year.\" And those threats are now reaching outside the Capitol. The department is being spread farther and wider to prevent attacks.",
      "\"The threats are coming in from all over the country. Not everybody knows it, but the Capitol Police has nationwide jurisdiction to address those threats,\" Manger said. \"So, we are sending investigators and agents all over this country to investigate these cases.\"",
      "The numbers back up Manger's claims about the rising threats. In 2024, the U.S. Capitol Police's Threat Assessment Section said it had investigated 9,474 concerning statements and direct threats against members of Congress, including their families and staff. The figure is more than double what it was seven years ago in 2017, when the section evaluated 3,939 cases against lawmakers.",
      "Manger told CBS News that when he first stepped into the role in July 2021, the Capitol Police had been \"woefully\" understaffed for years, but \"we have gotten to a point where we've gotten the staffing in terms of the physical security and in terms of screening, and in terms of responding to disturbances, addressing demonstrations, large and small.\"",
      "He has helped secure large budget increases for his department to help protect the Capitol campus, its members, staffers and visitors. But the growing need to bolster security and investigations in the 50 states \u2014 including the hometowns and home offices of members of Congress \u2014 has required more funding and more staff.",
      "Manger's budget request for 2026 is nearly $1 billion, approximately double the funding the department was given in 2021, prior to the Capitol riot, and it's about a 20% boost over funding levels in the current spending agreement. In a letter to a U.S. House subcommittee in April, Manger wrote, \"I recognize there are other police departments of a similar size whose budget is not as large as ours, but we are not an ordinary law enforcement agency.\"",
      "In his request, Manger also said he expected the number of threats against lawmakers to continue to rise, \"given the current political climate.\"",
      "Although it's the lawmakers whose safety is at stake, Manger suggested it took some convincing to get them to sign off on the budget increases.",
      "\"I do know that there are some members of Congress that, I think, have a little bit of Capitol Police fatigue in that, 'Geez, we've, we've, you know, raised your budget year after year after year. When is it enough?'\" Manger said. \"And I've told them, you know, when enough is. I've said, 'This is the number that we need in terms of dignitary protection. Here's what we need in terms of criminal investigations.'\"",
      "The Capitol Police have aggressively recruited and set ambitious hiring goals to help bolster their protection details for members of Congress. Manger, in his testimony before the House Appropriations Committee last month, said the department is adding dozens of new positions in the unit that oversees protective details and intelligence.",
      "He told CBS News the department was already hampered with a staffing shortage before the Jan. 6 attack and has faced hurdles in its effort to hire, due to morale issues and trauma suffered by officers after the Insurrection. Four officers who responded on Jan. 6 died by suicide within seven months of the attack. Many officers at the Capitol that day were subjected to repeated violent assaults. Manger has been urging lawmakers to support his recommended budget increase to help boost officer hiring and recruitment.",
      "\"When [lawmakers] travel, when they're at the airports, when they have congressional business to do at home,\" Manger said. \"They've got to meet with their constituents. So, we want to make sure that they're safe.\"",
      "An immediate replacement for Manger has not yet been named. The U.S. Capitol Police Board will select a successor, but he expects some lawmakers will also want to meet candidates for the position.",
      "At an April hearing on the Capitol Police budget, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who has oversight of the police department, said the department \"does need more to keep us safe.\"",

    "summary": "The State Department says all visa applicants who are seeking to travel to Harvard \u2014 visitors as well as students \u2014 should face additional vetting, according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The State Department has told U.S. embassies and consulates to expand vetting for all visa applicants who wish to come to Harvard University, including visitors as well as students, according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an internal email dated May 29 and sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's office to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts, consular officers were told that this \"additional vetting\" applies to anyone wanting a visa to come to Harvard for \"any purpose.\" That includes current or prospective students, faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and even tourists, per the email.",
      "The email told consular officers to \"conduct a complete screening of the online presence of any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose.\" Officers should also \"consider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to \"private\" or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.\"",
      "The email said consular officers can also request applicants to set their social media accounts to \"public\" for vetting purposes.",
      "Notably, the email states that the new vetting procedure for Harvard will also serve as a \"pilot for expanded screening and vetting\" of visa applicants \"generally,\" including for student visas. The State Department \"may announce similar measures for other groups of visa applicants as appropriate, and in accordance with U.S. law\".",
      "A source familiar with the email who was granted anonymity to speak freely told CBS news that it will likely be difficult to implement the vetting instructions uniformly across all US consular sections around the world, and for all universities assuming this pilot process gets expanded to foreign applicants for other U.S. universities.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department told embassies it was preparing for \"expanded social media vetting\" of student visa applicants, according to a cable obtained by CBS News. The department ordered a halt to new student visa appointments in the interim.",
      "\"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in response to the visa appointment freeze earlier this week.",
      "The stricter vetting procedure now targeting America's leading global university is the result of two executive orders signed by President Trump: One that directed more vetting for visas, and one calling for a crackdown on antisemitism, per the email.",
      "The email cited \"information identified by the Department of Homeland Security\" as apparently giving evidence that Harvard University has \"failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.\"",
      "Asked for comment regarding the expanded vetting instructions for Harvard-related visas, a State Department spokesperson told CBS News, \"The Department of State does not comment on its internal documents or communications.\" CBS News also asked the State Department why it has singled out Harvard for additional vetting.",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at Harvard in recent weeks, accusing it of failing to respond to what it views as rampant antisemitic activity on campus.",
      "Last week, the administration sought to take away Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students \u2014 a significant threat for a school where just over one in four students are international. The order was blocked by a judge following a lawsuit from Harvard. The Trump administration has also frozen federal funding to the Ivy League school.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration tried to revoke the student visa status of thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw the government's attention due to minor legal infractions. That policy was halted by a judge.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday the State Department will \"aggressively revoke\" visas for some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields\" and people with links to the Chinese Communist Party. China's embassy in the U.S. called the move \"politically motivated and discriminatory.\"",
      "And some international students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests have faced detention, under a law allowing the government to revoke visas for anyone deemed to pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "When asked by reporters Friday whether he supports international students studying in the U.S., Mr. Trump said he does: \"We want to have great students here, we just don't want students that are causing trouble.\"",
      "\"I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely,\" Mr. Trump said, reiterating his call to redirect funds from Harvard to trade schools. \"Harvard's trying to be a big shot.\"",

    "story": [
      "MAGA influencers and far-right leaders gathered in Poland and Hungary this week as the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC, held two international events \u2014 a show of strength in the increasing trans-Atlantic alliance between the Trump White House and Europe's populist conservative movement.",
      "On Thursday in Budapest, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u00a0was the keynote speaker for the country's CPAC event and hailed President Trump's first 100 days following his return to the Oval Office. \"The Trump tsunami swept through the entire world,\" Orb\u00e1n\u00a0 said. \"It gave back hope to the world. We are no longer suffocating in the woke sea.\"",
      "Prior to the Hungarian leader's speech, a video message from President Trump was played to those in attendance in which Mr. Trump praised the event and Orb\u00e1n himself.",
      "\"You know how I feel about Hungary and you know how I feel about CPAC. I respect and love them both. I also want to pay special regard to the leader of Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. He's a great man and a very special person,\" President Trump said in the video, which was later posted to social media by CPAC\u00a0chairman Matt Schlapp.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who according to Human Rights Watch has used his party's supermajority in Hungarian parliament to undermine the independence of the judiciary, crack down on independent media, demonize migrants and discriminate against LGBTQ people, was among a number of notable right-wing international leaders in attendance.",
      "Those leaders at the Budapest event included the leader of Germany's far-right AFD party\u00a0Alice Weidel, the leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) Geert Wilders, and former U.K. Conservative Party prime minister Liz Truss, as well as American social media influencers Ben Shapiro and Jack Posobiec.",
      "Notable speakers at Tuesday's events in Jasionka, Poland, included U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who gave the keynote address at the event.",
      "\"I do think it's good that we are collaborating with each other,\" Schlapp, a former White House political director, told CBS News on Friday. \"I think what we're doing is what, in the old-fashioned days, you would have called it friendship building and diplomacy, and building relationships in order to have the prosperity in our countries.\"",
      "Poland was playing host to CPAC for the first time earlier this week. Budapest was a venue for the event for the fourth year in row\u2014 underlining the growing relationship between MAGA Republicans and the country under Orban's ruling Fidesz Party. Many American conservatives have in recent years viewed Hungary \u2014 and Orb\u00e1n \u2014 as an aspirational playbook for governance in the United States.",
      "\"I think their policies on the border and on immigration have changed the whole conversation in Europe,\" Schlapp said. \"It's certainly between Orb\u00e1n  \u00a0and Trump, that have normalized this idea that you don't just have to take an unspecific numbers of illegal migrants because some global institution tells you that you must.\"",
      "A growing alliance on the right",
      "The conference is happening amidst a backdrop of tension between President Trump and America's traditional allies in Europe.",
      "While Mr. Trump recently announced that his planned 50% tariffs on European Union\u00a0goods would be delayed until July, the trading block and its European allies have had an unsteady relationship with the White House since Mr. Trump's return to power in January.",
      "Members of Trump's administration have at times broken the diplomatic norm by publicly weighing in on elections and policies in U.S.-allied nations.",
      "Vice President JD Vance berated European leaders at February's Munich Security Conference and accused U.S. allies of political censorship of right-wing ideas within their own countries. The vice president cited laws in the U.K. which criminalize protests within a certain distance of abortion clinics and EU laws on online content moderations, among other examples.",
      "That trend continued at Poland's CPAC event on Tuesday, where DHS Secretary Noem called for Poles to vote for right-wing presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki in the country's upcoming runoff election against liberal opponent Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the current mayor of Warsaw.",
      "\"I have watched over the years as socialists, and people who are just like this mayor of Warsaw, who is an absolute trainwreck of a leader, have destroyed our countries,\" Noem said, addressing attendees at the Jasionka event.",
      "The events this week also come just days after Samuel Samson, a senior adviser for the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, wrote a blog post on the State Department's website which signaled a shift in the issues the U.S. is prioritizing in its traditional alliances in Europe.",
      "\"The suppression of speech, facilitation of mass migration, targeting of religious expression, and undermining of electoral choice threatens the very foundation of the transatlantic partnership,\" the post read.",
      "The depth of the relationship between the populist right in Europe and President Trump was highlighted in the promotional description on CPAC Budapest's website.",
      "\"With the triumph of Donald Trump and the rise of the European Right, the Age of the Patriots of Western Civilization has begun \u2014 CPAC Hungary 2025 will be the hub of this movement,\" the description of the event read.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will allow the Trump administration to terminate a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States while a legal battle over the effort to end the legal protections proceeds.",
      "The high court agreed to grant a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in response to a federal district court order halting Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's decision to revoke en masse a grant of humanitarian parole to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela through a special program.",
      "The parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 people from the risk of deportation.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "Jackson, joined by Sotomayor, wrote that pausing the lower court's order \"would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgment regarding the legal arguments at issue,\" and she lambasted the majority for determining that it is \"in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the dissenting courts decide their legal claims.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration is confident in the legality of its actions and believes the Supreme Court will rule in its favor if it is asked to decide the merits of the Homeland Security secretary's blanket termination of parole.",
      "\"Just as we always said, President Trump and Secretary Noem acted within their legal authority to revoke temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands of individuals during the Biden administration,\" she said in a statement. \"The Biden administration's program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration, and President Trump fulfilled his promise by eliminating it.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it can now \"once again\" begin removing migrants who received humanitarian parole under the CHNV program.",
      "President Trump's administration has been steadily turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as it fights more than 200 lawsuits targeting many policies from the president's second-term agenda, though many of the court fights involving his efforts to crack down on immigration into the U.S. have led to heightened tensions with the federal judiciary.",
      "The dispute over the administration's attempt to revoke the temporary legal status granted to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is separate from other challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, which has been blocked by some courts. The high court has also allowed the Department of Homeland Security to revoke protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans for now.",
      "Since 1952, federal immigration law has allowed the executive branch to grant noncitizens parole for humanitarian reasons. The Department of Homeland Security created parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans during the Biden administration in late 2022 and early 2023, which required migrants seeking parole to apply through a sponsor who is in the U.S. lawfully and authorized them to work in the U.S. for two years.",
      "The Biden administration created the programs to address the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and said the protections promoted legal immigration. It did not allow those who came to the U.S. with the temporary protections to renew their parole beyond the two-year period.",
      "But soon after Mr. Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to terminate all parole programs, including CHNV. Acting on the executive order, Noem in March announced the Department of Homeland Security would be ending the CHNV program, with any grants of parole still in effect expiring by April 24.",
      "The move is part of the president's broader efforts to tamp down on immigration into the U.S., an issue that emerged as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for a second term in the White House.",
      "A group of 23 individuals, including several CHNV parolees, and a nonprofit organization challenged Noem's termination of the program, and a federal district court judge in Massachusetts agreed to halt Noem's blanket revocation of migrants' temporary legal status.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani found that the secretary could not categorically terminate the grants of parole because federal law required parole to be exercised on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which declined to pause the district court's order pending appeal. The Justice Department then sought the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in court filings that the district court's injunction nullifies \"one of the administration's most consequential immigration policy decisions.\"",
      "He wrote that order had the effect of \"needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election.\"",
      "But lawyers for the parole beneficiaries warned that absent the relief granted by the district judge, roughly half-a-million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans lawfully in the U.S. \"would have become undocumented, legally unemployable, and subject to mass expulsion on an expedited basis at midnight on April 24.\"",
      "\"The secretary is admittedly under no obligation to continue the CHNV parole process that brought class members here, but she nonetheless must respect required procedures and apply the law correctly before revoking their parole and upending their lives and causing mass disruption to their families, employers, and communities,\" they told the justices in a filing, adding that allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its mass termination of parole \"would cause an immense amount of needless human suffering.\"",

      "President Trump attacked the powerful conservative legal activist Leonard Leo late Thursday, calling the former Federalist Society leader who once advised the president on Supreme Court picks a \"bad person\" who \"probably hates America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out at Leo a day after a panel of judges \u2014 including a Trump appointee \u2014 called most of his tariffs illegal. The ruling, which was paused by an appellate court, put Mr. Trump at odds with some conservative lawyers: Two of the three judges who decided the case were appointed by Republicans, and the decision came in response to a lawsuit that cited right-leaning legal theories.",
      "The president attacked the three judges behind that ruling in a Truth Social post late Thursday, calling it a \"horrible, Country threatening decision\" and suggesting it was made because the judges hate him. He then turned his attention to Leo and the Federalist Society, two longstanding pillars of the conservative legal movement widely credited with helping Mr. Trump pick hundreds of federal judges \u2014 some of whom have ruled against his administration.",
      "\"I was new to Washington, and it was suggested that I use The Federalist Society as a recommending source on Judges,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Thursday. \"I did so, openly and freely, but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real \"sleazebag\" named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.\"",
      "In a statement, Leo said: \"I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved. ... There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attacks on Leo and the Federalist Society are striking because of their years-long alliance with the president. During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to listen to the right-leaning legal organization when making judicial picks, saying in an interview: \"We're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, Leo advised the president on his Supreme Court picks, who form a key part of the high court's 6-3 conservative majority. Along with other lawyers, Leo\u00a0helped\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0assemble lists\u00a0of potential Supreme Court justices \u2014 which the president then used to select his three nominees to the court.",
      "Leo spoke with Mr. Trump shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement in 2018, opening up a vacancy on the court that was filled by Brett Kavanaugh, Leo\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0at the time. When asked about how Mr. Trump's shortlist of possible nominees was put together, Leo said the president had \"called and asked to meet and suggested the idea of doing a list.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke positively about Leo in his first term. \"We had a list that you worked on very hard, and others,\" the president said in a\u00a02019 event.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he's \"disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also noted Leo has \"left The Federalist Society to do his own 'thing,'\" possibly referring to Leo's work with the Teneo Network, a group intended to \u2014 in Leo's words \u2014 \"crush liberal dominance\" in fields other than law, from entertainment to finance.",
      "The president has clashed with judges repeatedly in recent months, as parts of his agenda \u2014 including tariffs and immigration policy \u2014 face pushback from the federal judiciary.",
      "In particular, tariffs could pit one of Mr. Trump's signature economic policies against some of the legal theories championed by the conservative judicial movement. Lawsuits arguing Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to levy sweeping global tariffs have cited the nondelegation doctrine and the major questions doctrine, two legal concepts that right-leaning members of the Supreme Court \u2014 including ones chosen by Mr. Trump \u2014 have embraced for years.",

    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

He was a great New Yorker and American. Rest in peace, my friend,\" New York City Mayor Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement.",
      "Kerik, an Army veteran, rose to the pinnacle of law enforcement before a fall so steep that even a city jail named after him was renamed.",
      "In 2009, he pleaded guilty to federal tax fraud and false statement charges, partially stemming from over $250,000 in apartment renovations he received from a construction firm that authorities say counted on Kerik to convince New York officials it had no organized crime links. He served three years in prison before his release in 2013.",
      "President Trump pardoned Kerik during a 2020 clemency blitz. Kerik was among the guests feting Mr. Trump after his first appearance in federal court in Florida in a case related to his handling of classified documents, attending the former president's remarks at his Bedminster, New Jersey, club.",
      "Kerik caught the Bush administration off guard when he abruptly withdrew his nomination to run the Department of Homeland Security in 2004.",
      "At the time he said he had uncovered information that led him to question the immigration status of a person he employed as a housekeeper and nanny.",
      "The sprawling homeland security bureaucracy, created by Bush in the aftermath of 9/11, oversees the federal agencies responsible for enforcement of the nation's immigration laws, among many others.",
      "In 2005, Kerik founded the Kerik Group, a crisis and risk management consulting firm.",
      "He later worked for the former mayor of New York City surrounding the efforts to overturn Mr. Trump's 2020 loss.",
      "Patel described Kerik in a post on social media as \"a warrior, a patriot, and one of the most courageous public servants this country has ever known.\"",
      "\"He was decorated more than 100 times for bravery, valor, and service, having rescued victims from burning buildings, survived assassination attempts, and brought some of the world's most dangerous criminals to justice,\" he said. \"His legacy is not just in the medals or the titles, but in the lives he saved, the city he helped rebuild, and the country he served with honor.\"",

      "The couple, who starred on \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" submitted false financial statements to obtain more than $30 million in personal loans, which they spent on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel, the Justice Department said. The couple also concealed their income from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes, while also failing to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016. The couple pleaded not guilty.",

      "Michael Grimm",
      "The White House said on May 28 that Mr. Trump had pardoned former Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, who had pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax fraud and related charges. Prosecutors alleged he underreported wages and revenue to the government, and that he filed false tax documents at a restaurant he owned before serving in Congress.",

      "Grimm attempted a comeback run in 2018, but lost the GOP primary for his Staten Island and southern Brooklyn district. Grimm last year was paralyzed from the chest down after being thrown from a horse while playing polo.",
      "Former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins",
      "On May 26, the president said he was pardoning a former Virginia sheriff, Scott Jenkins, who was sentenced to prison in March on fraud and bribery charges. Jenkins took $75,000 worth of bribes, federal prosecutors said, giving badges to eight untrained and unvetted individuals from whom he had allegedly accepted cash and campaign contributions. Jenkins pleaded not guilty, and denied any connection between taking payments and issuing badges at trial.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that Jenkins, a longstanding supporter of the president's, \"is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn't deserve to spend a single day in jail.\"",

      "Devon Archer, a former business partner of Hunter Biden, was convicted in 2018 for his connection to a scheme to fraudulently issue more than $60 million of tribal bonds to the business arm of a South Dakota-based Native American tribe. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Archer \u2014 who pleaded not guilty \u2014 appealed his case, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court, which in 2024 refused to hear his attempt to overturn his conviction.",
      "As Mr. Trump prepared to sign the pardon, Trump staff secretary Will Scharf said \"the tone and tenor\" of the case against Archer \"changed dramatically after he began to cooperate with congressional investigators and serve as a witness against Hunter Biden and the Biden family.\"",
      "\"Many people have asked me to do this,\" Mr. Trump said before signing the pardon. \"I think he was treated very unfairly. And I looked at the record, studied the records, and he was. He was a victim of a crime, as far as I'm concerned. So we're going to undo that.\"",
      "Hunter Biden associate Jason Galanis",
      "Jason Galanis was sentenced in 2020 to over a decade of prison time for his alleged involvement in several fraud schemes, including the same one as Archer involving Native American tribal bonds. Mr. Trump commuted his sentence to time served. Galanis pleaded guilty.",

Long before he ran for president, Mr. Trump donated to the former Illinois governor's campaigns, and Blagojevich at one point was also a contestant on NBC's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" in March and April 2010, while he was fighting the corruption charges.

    "story": [
      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

      "It's an evocative idea that has long bedeviled scientists: a huge and mysterious planet is lurking in the darkness at the edge of our solar system, evading all our efforts to spot it. Some astronomers say the strange, clustered orbits of icy rocks beyond Neptune indicate that something big is out there, which they have dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"",
      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "An extraordinary dwarf planet discovered at the edge of our solar system @the_IAS https://t.co/B9Ia1gNxb9",
      "But that is still big enough to be considered a dwarf planet, lead study author Sihao Cheng of New Jersey's Institute for Advanced Study told AFP.",
      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",
      "But Sam Deen, a 23-year-old amateur astronomer from California, has already been able to track the dwarf planet candidate through old datasets.",
      "\"OF201 is, in my opinion, probably one of the most interesting discoveries in the outer solar system in the last decade,\" Deen told AFP.",
      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",

      "Astronomers have discovered a strange new object in our\u00a0Milky Way.",
      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves. What's more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "X-rays and radio waves are two different types of electromagnetic radiation. The correlation in their emission patterns in this case, along with other mysterious observations, led the study's authors to characterize what they found as \"unlike any known Galactic object.\"",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University's Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \"something exotic\" and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\"While our discovery doesn't yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\" Wang said. \"Either we are uncovering something entirely new, or we're seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we've never observed before.\"",

    "summary": "After back-to-back Starship upper stage failures, SpaceX on Tuesday again launched the world's most powerful rocket, but faced new problems.",
    "story": [
      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced Friday he'll double steel tariffs from 25% to 50% during a visit at a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh area.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

      "Musk had predicted he could cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, but the administration says DOGE has saved about $170 billion so far \u2014 though Musk predicted Friday the $1 trillion goal is still possible \"over time.\" Some of the cuts tallied by DOGE have contained errors, and one analysis estimates DOGE may end up costing the government hundreds of billions due to lost productivity and changes to federal workers' status.",
      "In recent days, Musk has criticized parts of Mr. Trump's agenda. He told CBS News earlier this week he has some \"differences of opinion\" with the administration, and feels \"a little stuck in a bind\" when he disagrees. He also said he was \"disappointed\" by the price tag of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping Trump-backed bill passed by House Republicans last week.",
      "But in Friday's Oval Office event, Mr. Trump was laudatory of Musk, saying his role \"has been without comparison in modern history.\" Musk said he expects to keep visiting the White House and will serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president.",

    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency as the billionaire's tenure as a \"special government employee\" comes to an end, saying his work \"has been without comparison in modern history.\"",
      "\"He's one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced,\" the president said, with Musk standing next to him. \"He stepped forward to put his very great talents into the service of our nation, and we appreciate it.\"",
      "The president said that through his work with DOGE, his cost-cutting task force, Musk and his team have overhauled the work of the federal government, calling it \"the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations.\"",
      "But while Musk came into the second Trump administration with a lofty promise of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget \u2014 and even wielded a \"chainsaw for bureaucracy\" on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February \u2014 he leaves with a tally falling far short of that goal. The White House has said that DOGE's government-slashing efforts have saved roughly $170 billion in spending, but the initiative's \"wall of receipts\" documenting spending cuts\u00a0contained a number of errors\u00a0and miscalculations.",
      "And an analysis from the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service estimated that DOGE's actions could actually\u00a0cost the government $135 billion\u00a0as a result of lost productivity and changes in the status of federal workers. Some have been\u00a0mistakenly fired, only to be rehired again.",
      "As a special government employee, Musk was limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period, and May 30 was his 130th day. But Mr. Trump indicated Musk will remain involved.",
      "\"Many of the DOGE people\" are staying on, Mr. Trump said, \"And Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling. It's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things.\"",
      "During the Oval Office meeting, Mr. Trump also praised a recent,\u00a0temporary decision\u00a0from a federal appeals court that reinstated most of his tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law. A three-judge U.S. trade court panel unanimously ruled Wednesday that the 10% tariffs, levied against nearly every U.S. trading partner, were an\u00a0unlawful exercise of the president's authority. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit temporarily halted that decision while it takes more time to consider an appeal by the Justice Department.",
      "\"The tariffs are so important, and that's why we were so happy with the decision yesterday where the tariffs continued, because without the tariffs, our nation would be in peril,\" he said.",
      "Earlier this week, Musk announced on X, the social media site he owns, that he would be finishing his time at the White House and thanked Mr. Trump for \"the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" an initiative led by DOGE. He predicted DOGE's mission \"will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout government.\"",
      "The president had confirmed on social media that Musk's last day would be Friday but added the caveat that \"he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\" A senior administration official said Musk was set to begin his offboarding process Wednesday night. His departure marks his return to the private sector.",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration is \"committed\" to making the cuts made by DOGE permanent and will seek codification by Congress.",
      "In his time serving as a senior adviser to the president and leading DOGE, Musk roiled Washington through his team's unsparing cuts to the federal workforce, cancellation of billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts, and dismantling of several agencies, even if some of those actions have been blocked by the courts.",
      "DOGE's cuts have reverberated far outside the nation's capital, with food banks, nonprofit organizations and child abuse prevention programs, among others, impacted. Aid organizations warned earlier this year that the administration's slashing of foreign aid from the U.S. Agency for International Development threatened to exacerbate the devastating famine in Sudan.",
      "Musk, speaking in the Oval Office, defended DOGE's work and when pressed on the cuts the task force identified, said he expects it will achieve the $1 trillion goal he touted \"over time.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time,\" he said. For his Oval Office appearance, the Tesla CEO wore a DOGE baseball cap and black blazer over a \"DOGEfather\" t shirt. He also had a black eye and explained that while \"horsing around,\" his 5-year-old son had punched him in the face.",

    "summary": "Army guidelines instruct commanders and soldiers on interacting with and identifying service members with gender dysphoria as they leave the military.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Transgender military service members must come forward and voluntarily leave active-duty service next week, by June 6, according to Defense Department\u00a0guidance issued by Secretary Pete Hegseth. After that, the military is expected to begin involuntary separations for active-duty trans service members who remain.",
      "One of the service branches, the Army, on Wednesday issued more guidance about how it will identify and interact with soldiers with gender dysphoria, according to documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "Although Hegseth had made formal assurances in a February memo that transgender service members would be treated with dignity, the Army's new internal directives to units instruct personnel to intentionally address transgender troops \u2014 even superior officers \u2014 in accordance with an individual's medical assignment at birth rather than by their preferred pronoun.",
      "When the military starts forcing out transgender troops through involuntary separations, soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria following a list of criteria outlined in the guidance. The markers include past requests for grooming standard exemptions tied to medical assignment at birth or the initiation of a medical treatment plan tied to gender dysphoria. \"Overt conduct,\" either on social media or in person, of gender identity differing from assigned sex at birth and even a commander's \"private conversation\" where a soldier disclosed gender dysphoria are considered relevant under the guidance.",
      "The commander is expected to initiate a medical record review if aware of any of the criteria above, and service members will also be asked during routine medical check-ups about their identity as a result of the Defense Department's new policy.",
      "In a February\u00a0memo filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said transgender troops will be \"treated with dignity and respect.\" But in public, the Army veteran and former Fox News host has instead railed against transgender service members,\u00a0saying at a Special Operations Forces military conference in Florida in May, \"No more dudes in dresses, we're done with that s***.\"",
      "The Army guidance also instructs soldiers to use the \"utmost professionalism and treating all individuals with dignity and respect,\" but the policies run counter to transgender social norms, like addressing transgender troops by the pronouns they prefer.",
      "Army\u00a0Maj. Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer and Afghanistan veteran with 17 years of military service, now faces separation from the armed forces. She defended the service of transgender troops when contacted Friday by CBS News.",
      "\"By implementing this guidance\u2026you're making it worse than the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, because you're overtly hunting down and trying to identify transgender service members or anybody that\u2026exhibits symptoms of gender dysphoria,\" Corcoran said.",
      "She added: \"Transgender service members have served openly since 2016 without adverse impacts on readiness or unit cohesion. Thousands of transgender troops are combat-tested, having deployed to war zones and executed missions with distincction.\"",
      "The Defense Department defines gender dysphoria as a \"marked incongruence between an individual's experienced or expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least six months, as manifested by conditions causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\"",
      "The Army guidance issued to units on Wednesday begins with the suggestion that identifying with a gender different from one's sex assigned at birth is at odds with the values of truthfulness and discipline expected of service members \u2014 even beyond the uniform they wear. The guidance echoes the statements in President Trump's January\u00a0executive order stating the values of transgender service members represent a departure from the \"humility and selflessness required\" of military members and are \"inconsistent with\" the \"cohesion\" the armed forces demand.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Thursday, an Army spokesperson at the Pentagon said that since May 8, additional guidance has been issued as the service continues to voluntarily separate service members.",
      "When asked about soldiers being directed to misgender transgender soldiers, the Army spokesman, who did not want to be identified while speaking on behalf of the service, repeated what was in the guidance obtained by CBS News: \"Pronoun usage when referring to Soldiers must reflect their biological sex. In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\") must also reflect an individual's biological sex.\"",
      "The Army spokesman added, \"The Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered to serve our great nation. We are in the process of ensuring the Army is aligned with recent policy changes to Soldier requirements. Regardless of potential outcomes, every Soldier will be treated with dignity and respect.\"",
      "Commanders have also been instructed to revise official records to reflect service members' sex at birth, rather than their gender identity. In the interim, transgender troops are expected to comply with policies aligned with biological sex\u2014ranging from physical fitness standards to uniform requirements, sleeping quarters and access to restrooms and showers.",
      "Under current policy, decisions to separate soldiers outside standard regulatory grounds rest solely with the secretary of the Army \u2014 a power typically reserved for exceptional circumstances. Enlisted transgender soldiers will be separated under the Secretarial Plenary Authority, a mechanism the Army itself\u00a0acknowledges is \"exercised sparingly.\" Historically, this little used authority has surfaced during politically fraught chapters of military policy \u2014 from discharges over COVID-19 mandate refusals to the now-defunct \"Don't ask, Don't Tell\" era.",
      "While both enlisted and officer transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge unless their service warrants a lower characterization, they will also receive an RE-3 enlistment code, meaning they are not eligible to rejoin the Army or any other U.S. military service without a waiver.",
      "Army military officers will be separated on the basis that \"their continued service is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\" CBS News has not yet seen directives from the other service branches and whether they mirror the Army's policies.",
      "Under the Army guidance obtained by CBS News, transgender officers will receive what's known as a \"Code JDK\" upon separation. The JDK code is for the Military Personnel Security Program, and is typically applied to discharge paperwork where a service member is being separated from the U.S. military for a security reason.",
      "Cody Harnish, a former Army Judge Advocate General officer and now a private defense attorney for U.S. service members, told CBS News by phone on Thursday that a JDK separation code is a red flag and signals to other government agencies that the service members were separated for \"national security interests.\"",
      "\"This can be a serious roadblock to keeping or transferring a security clearance to future employment requiring a clearance,\" said Harnish. He said under President Trump's executive order revoking gender identity discrimination protections, if a transgender veteran's separation from the military bears this code and is vetted for a job requiring a security clearance,\u00a0\"being transgender can again be viewed as a security concern.\"",
      "Harnish said that having the JDK separation code on their record may be interpreted by future employers \"as evidence of heightened risk, severely complicating or blocking clearance maintenance or transfer after military service.\"",
      "But amid the crackdown and political rhetoric surrounding the service of transgender service members, Maj. Corcoran offered a pointed reflection on patriotism, duty, and shared sacrifice.",
      "\"It's simple, we transgender service members believe in the same American values you do\u2014liberty and freedom,\" said Corcoran. \"The nation's strength comes together for a common purpose in the face of the ever-increasing hostile global environment. It is in the blood of the warrior spirit that we all stand ready to fight, and if need be, die in the defense of the cherished institutions of America. Let us embody this by serving.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-court-ruling-ieepa/",
    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 18:14:51 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",
      "Duplessie turned himself in to police on May 27, the NYPD said. His attorney said in court that Duplessie's involvement in the case is hotly disputed and he decided to turn himself in when he found out about Woeltz's arrest, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",
      "During that time, the suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, hitting him on the head with a gun and pointing a gun at his head several times, prosecutors said. An AirTag tracking device was tied around the man's neck, and the suspects allegedly told him they would find him if he left the house.",
      "Prosecutors also said the suspects allegedly hanged the man over the ledge of the building and threatened to kill him if he didn't give up his password. The suspects also allegedly threatened to have the man's family killed if he didn't give them what they wanted, prosecutors said.",
      "The man told authorities the suspects cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine and urinated on him during his captivity, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"To be tortured for 17 days in terms of a chain saw cutting your leg, in terms of putting your feet in water and electrocuting him, in terms of making the person ingest narcotics, horrible crime,\" NYPD Chief of Department John Chell, the police department's highest-ranking uniformed member, told CBS News New York.",
      "The man escaped after telling Woeltz he would give him the password, but it was on his laptop, prosecutors said. When Woeltz went to get the laptop, the man went downstairs and bolted from the house.",
      "Police sources told CBS News New York that two NYPD detectives did private security work for the suspects, but there isn't any indication that the detectives knew about the alleged kidnapping. One of the detectives picked up the Italian man at an airport and brought him to the SoHo town house, two sources told CBS News New York.",

      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",

    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-police-chief-manger-spike-in-threats-congress/",
    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 15:47:20 -0400",
    "summary": "Retiring Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger says threats facing lawmakers have more than quadrupled over the past several years.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger retires from his post at the Capitol Friday, he says the threats facing members of Congress have accelerated\u00a0 \u2014 they've more than quadrupled over the past several years and remain alarmingly high.",
      "Manger, who took charge of the department in the difficult months after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol siege, quantified the surge in threats targeting lawmakers and how the department has had to evolve to expand its protection of senators and House members.",
      "Leaning forward in his seat to emphasize his point, Manger said, \"It's a huge responsibility. We've gone from 1,000 to 2,000 threats a year to now 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 threats a year.\" And those threats are now reaching outside the Capitol. The department is being spread farther and wider to prevent attacks.",
      "\"The threats are coming in from all over the country. Not everybody knows it, but the Capitol Police has nationwide jurisdiction to address those threats,\" Manger said. \"So, we are sending investigators and agents all over this country to investigate these cases.\"",
      "The numbers back up Manger's claims about the rising threats. In 2024, the U.S. Capitol Police's Threat Assessment Section said it had investigated 9,474 concerning statements and direct threats against members of Congress, including their families and staff. The figure is more than double what it was seven years ago in 2017, when the section evaluated 3,939 cases against lawmakers.",
      "Manger told CBS News that when he first stepped into the role in July 2021, the Capitol Police had been \"woefully\" understaffed for years, but \"we have gotten to a point where we've gotten the staffing in terms of the physical security and in terms of screening, and in terms of responding to disturbances, addressing demonstrations, large and small.\"",
      "He has helped secure large budget increases for his department to help protect the Capitol campus, its members, staffers and visitors. But the growing need to bolster security and investigations in the 50 states \u2014 including the hometowns and home offices of members of Congress \u2014 has required more funding and more staff.",
      "Manger's budget request for 2026 is nearly $1 billion, approximately double the funding the department was given in 2021, prior to the Capitol riot, and it's about a 20% boost over funding levels in the current spending agreement. In a letter to a U.S. House subcommittee in April, Manger wrote, \"I recognize there are other police departments of a similar size whose budget is not as large as ours, but we are not an ordinary law enforcement agency.\"",
      "In his request, Manger also said he expected the number of threats against lawmakers to continue to rise, \"given the current political climate.\"",
      "Although it's the lawmakers whose safety is at stake, Manger suggested it took some convincing to get them to sign off on the budget increases.",
      "\"I do know that there are some members of Congress that, I think, have a little bit of Capitol Police fatigue in that, 'Geez, we've, we've, you know, raised your budget year after year after year. When is it enough?'\" Manger said. \"And I've told them, you know, when enough is. I've said, 'This is the number that we need in terms of dignitary protection. Here's what we need in terms of criminal investigations.'\"",
      "The Capitol Police have aggressively recruited and set ambitious hiring goals to help bolster their protection details for members of Congress. Manger, in his testimony before the House Appropriations Committee last month, said the department is adding dozens of new positions in the unit that oversees protective details and intelligence.",
      "He told CBS News the department was already hampered with a staffing shortage before the Jan. 6 attack and has faced hurdles in its effort to hire, due to morale issues and trauma suffered by officers after the Insurrection. Four officers who responded on Jan. 6 died by suicide within seven months of the attack. Many officers at the Capitol that day were subjected to repeated violent assaults. Manger has been urging lawmakers to support his recommended budget increase to help boost officer hiring and recruitment.",
      "\"When [lawmakers] travel, when they're at the airports, when they have congressional business to do at home,\" Manger said. \"They've got to meet with their constituents. So, we want to make sure that they're safe.\"",
      "An immediate replacement for Manger has not yet been named. The U.S. Capitol Police Board will select a successor, but he expects some lawmakers will also want to meet candidates for the position.",
      "At an April hearing on the Capitol Police budget, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who has oversight of the police department, said the department \"does need more to keep us safe.\"",

    "summary": "Counselors are urging foreign students applying to U.S. colleges to avoid certain topics online as the State Department scrutinizes their social media.",
    "story": [
      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says that kids with no underlying health conditions \"may receive\" COVID-19 vaccines, dropping a broad recommendation for all children to get vaccinated against the virus.",
      "Updates to the CDC's childhood immunization schedule were published late Thursday, following an announcement earlier this week by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.",
      "\"Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,\" the CDC says in its new guidance.",
      "Thursday's change to what the CDC calls \"shared clinical decision-making\" recommendations for children means that health insurance companies will continue to be required to broadly cover the shots for now in this age group.",
      "The agency still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most\u00a0adults\u00a0for now. COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are now listed as \"No Guidance/Not Applicable,\" where they were previously recommended for all pregnant adults.",
      "While Kennedy said in his video announcement\u00a0that healthy pregnant women were also being removed from the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, several pages of agency guidance saying that pregnant women are recommended to get vaccinated because of their higher risk of severe disease remain on the CDC's website as of Friday.",
      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby. The benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" one CDC webpage still reads.",
      "Health authorities and experts closely watch changes to the CDC's recommendations, usually updated through open meetings of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, since they are tied to policies like liability protections and insurance coverage requirements.",
      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",
      "Instead, pregnancy was listed during the meeting as among the underlying conditions that might warrant a continued recommendation for vaccination.",
      "RFK Jr.'s directive to CDC",
      "Multiple CDC officials said the change came after the agency received a directive signed by Kennedy, shortly after he posted his announcement to social media.",
      "Kennedy's memo cited \"a review of the recommendations\" of the Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, saying that the risks of the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children \"do not outweigh the purported benefits of the vaccine.\" The directive also cited \"the lack of high-quality data demonstrating safety of the mRNA vaccines during pregnancy combined with the uncertainty of the benefits\" for pregnant moms and their baby.",
      "\"Truly the death of expertise. This would be like the secretary of transportation directing that all planes must fly 5,000 feet higher than current. It's vibe-based decision making,\" one federal health official said of the directive.",
      "Agency officials overseeing immunization recommendations said they were surprised by Kennedy's move. The Washington Post previously reported news of the directive.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will allow the Trump administration to terminate a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States while a legal battle over the effort to end the legal protections proceeds.",
      "The high court agreed to grant a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in response to a federal district court order halting Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's decision to revoke en masse a grant of humanitarian parole to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela through a special program.",
      "The parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 people from the risk of deportation.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "Jackson, joined by Sotomayor, wrote that pausing the lower court's order \"would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgment regarding the legal arguments at issue,\" and she lambasted the majority for determining that it is \"in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the dissenting courts decide their legal claims.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration is confident in the legality of its actions and believes the Supreme Court will rule in its favor if it is asked to decide the merits of the Homeland Security secretary's blanket termination of parole.",
      "\"Just as we always said, President Trump and Secretary Noem acted within their legal authority to revoke temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands of individuals during the Biden administration,\" she said in a statement. \"The Biden administration's program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration, and President Trump fulfilled his promise by eliminating it.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it can now \"once again\" begin removing migrants who received humanitarian parole under the CHNV program.",
      "President Trump's administration has been steadily turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as it fights more than 200 lawsuits targeting many policies from the president's second-term agenda, though many of the court fights involving his efforts to crack down on immigration into the U.S. have led to heightened tensions with the federal judiciary.",
      "The dispute over the administration's attempt to revoke the temporary legal status granted to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is separate from other challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, which has been blocked by some courts. The high court has also allowed the Department of Homeland Security to revoke protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans for now.",
      "Since 1952, federal immigration law has allowed the executive branch to grant noncitizens parole for humanitarian reasons. The Department of Homeland Security created parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans during the Biden administration in late 2022 and early 2023, which required migrants seeking parole to apply through a sponsor who is in the U.S. lawfully and authorized them to work in the U.S. for two years.",
      "The Biden administration created the programs to address the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and said the protections promoted legal immigration. It did not allow those who came to the U.S. with the temporary protections to renew their parole beyond the two-year period.",
      "But soon after Mr. Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to terminate all parole programs, including CHNV. Acting on the executive order, Noem in March announced the Department of Homeland Security would be ending the CHNV program, with any grants of parole still in effect expiring by April 24.",
      "The move is part of the president's broader efforts to tamp down on immigration into the U.S., an issue that emerged as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for a second term in the White House.",
      "A group of 23 individuals, including several CHNV parolees, and a nonprofit organization challenged Noem's termination of the program, and a federal district court judge in Massachusetts agreed to halt Noem's blanket revocation of migrants' temporary legal status.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani found that the secretary could not categorically terminate the grants of parole because federal law required parole to be exercised on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which declined to pause the district court's order pending appeal. The Justice Department then sought the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in court filings that the district court's injunction nullifies \"one of the administration's most consequential immigration policy decisions.\"",
      "He wrote that order had the effect of \"needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election.\"",
      "But lawyers for the parole beneficiaries warned that absent the relief granted by the district judge, roughly half-a-million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans lawfully in the U.S. \"would have become undocumented, legally unemployable, and subject to mass expulsion on an expedited basis at midnight on April 24.\"",
      "\"The secretary is admittedly under no obligation to continue the CHNV parole process that brought class members here, but she nonetheless must respect required procedures and apply the law correctly before revoking their parole and upending their lives and causing mass disruption to their families, employers, and communities,\" they told the justices in a filing, adding that allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its mass termination of parole \"would cause an immense amount of needless human suffering.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal for a new Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "The United States and Israel are waiting for\u00a0Hamas\u00a0to respond to a 60-day\u00a0Gaza ceasefire\u00a0proposal, the White House said Thursday.",
      "Israel signed off on a proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump submitted, and it's been sent to Hamas, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "During the proposed 60-day ceasefire, a draft of the deal obtained by CBS News indicated that Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees as part of the deal, as well as 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Five living hostages and nine deceased from the \"list of 58\" remaining hostages would be released on the first day of the agreement, while a second group would be released on the seventh day, according to the document.",
      "According to the document, humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza immediately once Hamas agrees to the deal, and it will be distributed through \"agreed upon channels that will include the United Nations and Red Crescent.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that special envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home.\"",
      "Leavitt said Hamas hasn't accepted the deal, to her knowledge, but if there is a deal, the public will hear so directly from her, Witkoff or the president himself.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement Thursday that the proposal \"fails to meet any of our people's demands, foremost among them an end to the war and famine,\" but the \"movement's leadership is studying the response with full national responsibility, in light of the genocide our people are facing.\"",
      "A senior Hamas figure closely involved in negotiations told CBS News they are studying the proposal and don't feel there are a lot of options. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel is not going to attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire, the senior Hamas figure said.",
      "The proposal obtained by CBS News outlines that all Israeli offensive military activities in Gaza will cease once the deal is agreed upon, and that during the 60 days, there will be a cessation of aerial movement in the Gaza Strip for 10 hours daily, or 12 hours daily when the exchange of hostages and prisoners take place.",
      "Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would begin on the first day of the agreement and would include discussing the exchange of the remaining hostages, issues relating to redeployment and withdrawals of Israeli forces, and long-term security within Gaza.",
      "President Trump, who on Friday told reporters in the Oval Office that they are \"very close to an agreement on Gaza,\" will personally announce the ceasefire agreement, the proposal says.",
      "A source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas tells CBS News that a deal is close, and once a response is received, it will be transmitted directly to Mr. Trump and Witkoff.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to still be alive, out of about 250 who were taken during the group's terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest have either been released during earlier pauses in fighting or have been confirmed dead.",
      "An earlier two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas\u00a0ended in March\u00a0after the two sides failed to agree on terms for extending it, and Israel resumed strikes on the Gaza Strip. During that temporary truce, dozens of hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for Israel freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0he was open to a temporary ceasefire deal to release more hostages, but \"there will be no way we will stop the war\" until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Since then, about 54,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.",
      "Aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip\u00a0resumed earlier this month\u00a0after a more than two-month blockade. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid group,\u00a0began distributing food\u00a0this week.",

    "story": [
      "MAGA influencers and far-right leaders gathered in Poland and Hungary this week as the Conservative Political Action Conference, known as CPAC, held two international events \u2014 a show of strength in the increasing trans-Atlantic alliance between the Trump White House and Europe's populist conservative movement.",
      "On Thursday in Budapest, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u00a0was the keynote speaker for the country's CPAC event and hailed President Trump's first 100 days following his return to the Oval Office. \"The Trump tsunami swept through the entire world,\" Orb\u00e1n\u00a0 said. \"It gave back hope to the world. We are no longer suffocating in the woke sea.\"",
      "Prior to the Hungarian leader's speech, a video message from President Trump was played to those in attendance in which Mr. Trump praised the event and Orb\u00e1n himself.",
      "\"You know how I feel about Hungary and you know how I feel about CPAC. I respect and love them both. I also want to pay special regard to the leader of Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. He's a great man and a very special person,\" President Trump said in the video, which was later posted to social media by CPAC\u00a0chairman Matt Schlapp.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who according to Human Rights Watch has used his party's supermajority in Hungarian parliament to undermine the independence of the judiciary, crack down on independent media, demonize migrants and discriminate against LGBTQ people, was among a number of notable right-wing international leaders in attendance.",
      "Those leaders at the Budapest event included the leader of Germany's far-right AFD party\u00a0Alice Weidel, the leader of the Dutch far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) Geert Wilders, and former U.K. Conservative Party prime minister Liz Truss, as well as American social media influencers Ben Shapiro and Jack Posobiec.",
      "Notable speakers at Tuesday's events in Jasionka, Poland, included U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who gave the keynote address at the event.",
      "\"I do think it's good that we are collaborating with each other,\" Schlapp, a former White House political director, told CBS News on Friday. \"I think what we're doing is what, in the old-fashioned days, you would have called it friendship building and diplomacy, and building relationships in order to have the prosperity in our countries.\"",
      "Poland was playing host to CPAC for the first time earlier this week. Budapest was a venue for the event for the fourth year in row\u2014 underlining the growing relationship between MAGA Republicans and the country under Orban's ruling Fidesz Party. Many American conservatives have in recent years viewed Hungary \u2014 and Orb\u00e1n \u2014 as an aspirational playbook for governance in the United States.",
      "\"I think their policies on the border and on immigration have changed the whole conversation in Europe,\" Schlapp said. \"It's certainly between Orb\u00e1n  \u00a0and Trump, that have normalized this idea that you don't just have to take an unspecific numbers of illegal migrants because some global institution tells you that you must.\"",
      "A growing alliance on the right",
      "The conference is happening amidst a backdrop of tension between President Trump and America's traditional allies in Europe.",
      "While Mr. Trump recently announced that his planned 50% tariffs on European Union\u00a0goods would be delayed until July, the trading block and its European allies have had an unsteady relationship with the White House since Mr. Trump's return to power in January.",
      "Members of Trump's administration have at times broken the diplomatic norm by publicly weighing in on elections and policies in U.S.-allied nations.",
      "Vice President JD Vance berated European leaders at February's Munich Security Conference and accused U.S. allies of political censorship of right-wing ideas within their own countries. The vice president cited laws in the U.K. which criminalize protests within a certain distance of abortion clinics and EU laws on online content moderations, among other examples.",
      "That trend continued at Poland's CPAC event on Tuesday, where DHS Secretary Noem called for Poles to vote for right-wing presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki in the country's upcoming runoff election against liberal opponent Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the current mayor of Warsaw.",
      "\"I have watched over the years as socialists, and people who are just like this mayor of Warsaw, who is an absolute trainwreck of a leader, have destroyed our countries,\" Noem said, addressing attendees at the Jasionka event.",
      "The events this week also come just days after Samuel Samson, a senior adviser for the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, wrote a blog post on the State Department's website which signaled a shift in the issues the U.S. is prioritizing in its traditional alliances in Europe.",
      "\"The suppression of speech, facilitation of mass migration, targeting of religious expression, and undermining of electoral choice threatens the very foundation of the transatlantic partnership,\" the post read.",
      "The depth of the relationship between the populist right in Europe and President Trump was highlighted in the promotional description on CPAC Budapest's website.",
      "\"With the triumph of Donald Trump and the rise of the European Right, the Age of the Patriots of Western Civilization has begun \u2014 CPAC Hungary 2025 will be the hub of this movement,\" the description of the event read.",

We're talking about having a CPAC in Colombia. We've had talks to have a CPAC in El Salvador. We've have talks to have CPAC in various other European countries,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will allow the Trump administration to terminate a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States while a legal battle over the effort to end the legal protections proceeds.",
      "The high court agreed to grant a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in response to a federal district court order halting Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's decision to revoke en masse a grant of humanitarian parole to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela through a special program.",
      "The parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 people from the risk of deportation.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "Jackson, joined by Sotomayor, wrote that pausing the lower court's order \"would facilitate needless human suffering before the courts have reached a final judgment regarding the legal arguments at issue,\" and she lambasted the majority for determining that it is \"in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the dissenting courts decide their legal claims.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration is confident in the legality of its actions and believes the Supreme Court will rule in its favor if it is asked to decide the merits of the Homeland Security secretary's blanket termination of parole.",
      "\"Just as we always said, President Trump and Secretary Noem acted within their legal authority to revoke temporary status granted to hundreds of thousands of individuals during the Biden administration,\" she said in a statement. \"The Biden administration's program violated black letter immigration law, incentivized additional illegal immigration, and President Trump fulfilled his promise by eliminating it.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it can now \"once again\" begin removing migrants who received humanitarian parole under the CHNV program.",
      "President Trump's administration has been steadily turning to the Supreme Court for emergency relief as it fights more than 200 lawsuits targeting many policies from the president's second-term agenda, though many of the court fights involving his efforts to crack down on immigration into the U.S. have led to heightened tensions with the federal judiciary.",
      "The dispute over the administration's attempt to revoke the temporary legal status granted to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is separate from other challenges to Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, which has been blocked by some courts. The high court has also allowed the Department of Homeland Security to revoke protected status for roughly 350,000 Venezuelans for now.",
      "Since 1952, federal immigration law has allowed the executive branch to grant noncitizens parole for humanitarian reasons. The Department of Homeland Security created parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans during the Biden administration in late 2022 and early 2023, which required migrants seeking parole to apply through a sponsor who is in the U.S. lawfully and authorized them to work in the U.S. for two years.",
      "The Biden administration created the programs to address the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and said the protections promoted legal immigration. It did not allow those who came to the U.S. with the temporary protections to renew their parole beyond the two-year period.",
      "But soon after Mr. Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to terminate all parole programs, including CHNV. Acting on the executive order, Noem in March announced the Department of Homeland Security would be ending the CHNV program, with any grants of parole still in effect expiring by April 24.",
      "The move is part of the president's broader efforts to tamp down on immigration into the U.S., an issue that emerged as a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for a second term in the White House.",
      "A group of 23 individuals, including several CHNV parolees, and a nonprofit organization challenged Noem's termination of the program, and a federal district court judge in Massachusetts agreed to halt Noem's blanket revocation of migrants' temporary legal status.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani found that the secretary could not categorically terminate the grants of parole because federal law required parole to be exercised on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which declined to pause the district court's order pending appeal. The Justice Department then sought the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in court filings that the district court's injunction nullifies \"one of the administration's most consequential immigration policy decisions.\"",
      "He wrote that order had the effect of \"needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election.\"",
      "But lawyers for the parole beneficiaries warned that absent the relief granted by the district judge, roughly half-a-million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans lawfully in the U.S. \"would have become undocumented, legally unemployable, and subject to mass expulsion on an expedited basis at midnight on April 24.\"",
      "\"The secretary is admittedly under no obligation to continue the CHNV parole process that brought class members here, but she nonetheless must respect required procedures and apply the law correctly before revoking their parole and upending their lives and causing mass disruption to their families, employers, and communities,\" they told the justices in a filing, adding that allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its mass termination of parole \"would cause an immense amount of needless human suffering.\"",

    "story": [
      "The bodies of five musicians, members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing, were found in the northern city of Reynosa along the Texas border, authorities said on Thursday.",
      "The musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo, which played at parties and local dances in the region, had been reported missing since Sunday.",
      "Tamaulipas state prosecutors, who had been investigating their disappearance, said the men were kidnapped around 10 p.m. that night while traveling in a SUV on the way to a venue where they were hired to play. Their bodies were found on the fringes of Reynosa. Prosecutors said nine suspects believed to be part of a faction of the Gulf Cartel, which has strong presence in the city, have been arrested.",
      "Authorities were not immediately able to say why the men were slain, and did not deny reports by local media that the bodies had been burned.",
      "Relatives had reported receiving ransom demands for the musicians, aged between 20 and 40 years old. The band was hired to put on a concert but arrived to find a vacant lot, according to family members.",
      "The genre they played \u2014 Mexican regional music, which encapsulates a wide range of styles including corridos and cumbia \u2014 has in recent years gained a spotlight as it's entered a sort of international musical renaissance. Young artists sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the group played such songs or if the artists were simply victims of rampant cartel violence that has eclipsed the city. But other artists have faced death threats by cartels, while others have had their visas stripped by the United States under accusations by the Trump administration that they were glorifying criminal violence.",
      "The last time the musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo were heard from was the night they were kidnapped, when they told family members they were on the way to the event. After that, nothing else was heard of them.",
      "Their disappearance caused an uproar in Tamaulipas, a state long eclipsed by cartel warfare. Their families reported the disappearances, called on the public for support and people took to the streets in protest.",
      "On Wednesday, protesters blocked the international bridge connecting Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, later going to a local cathedral to pray and make offerings to the disappeared.",
      "Reynosa is a Mexican border city adjacent to the United States and has been plagued by escalating violence since 2017 due to internal disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling and fuel theft.",
      "Musicians sometimes get caught in cartel turf wars",
      "Mexican musicians have previously been targeted by criminal groups that pay them to compose and perform songs that glorify the exploits of their leaders.",
      "Such performers often live in close proximity to their drug lord patrons, and can at times get caught up in gang turf battles.",
      "\"Narcocorridos\" are a controversial sub-genre of music in Mexico, and the songs have caught the attention of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who recently launched a music contest \"for peace and against addictions,\" seeking to counter the popularity of the music among young people in Mexico and the United States.",
      "Several regions in the country have banned \"narcocorridos,\" sparking a recent riot during a concert after a singer refused to perform some of his most popular songs.",
      "In April, the U.S. State Department\u00a0revoked the visas of members\u00a0of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration,\u00a0said on social media\u00a0that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The controversy broke out in late March when the face of\u00a0Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes\u00a0layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to\u00a0train cartel recruits\u00a0and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes. The U.S. government has offered a\u00a0$15 million reward\u00a0for information leading to Oseguera's capture. In November, his son-in-law was\u00a0arrested in California\u00a0after U.S. officials say he faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" north of the border.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been\u00a0designated\u00a0as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison.",
      "In January this year, a small plane was reported to have dropped pamphlets on a northwestern city threatening around 20 music artists and influencers for alleged dealings with a warring faction of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",

      "He added: \"This is an unpleasant decision.\"",
      "At the courthouse, two of the soccer star's daughters, Gianinna and Dalma Maradona, began to weep.",
      "The decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July. Thursday's ruling said that a higher court would select the three new judges by lottery \"within a reasonable period of time.\"",
      "The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in weeks leading up to his sudden death on Nov. 25, 2020. Maradona died at age 60 from cardiac arrest while recovering from surgery for a blood clot on the brain at a rented home outside Buenos Aires.",
      "Although the case largely hinges on medical technicalities, the biweekly testimonies have also become tabloid fodder \u2014 like much in Maradona's life, which included long spates of drug and alcohol abuse.",
      "Experts have taken the stand to allege that Maradona agonized for 12 hours before his death, while his sisters and daughters have tearfully accused his medics of leaving him alone in squalor when he should have been hospitalized.",
      "The defendants, who deny all accusations, were charged with culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter in that it implies the accused were aware of the risk caused by their reckless conduct and ignored it.",
      "They include Leopoldo Luque, Maradona's primary physician at the time of his death, as well as his psychologist, psychiatrist, medical coordinator and nurses.",
      "The crime carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The defendants say Maradona was a difficult patient who did not allow himself to be treated.",
      "Maradona, who famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. His rags-to-riches story resonated with his fellow Argentines and he is widely revered as a national hero.",

    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 17:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Karin Prien was warned in 1960s Germany to hide her Jewish faith. Now in the government, she says a lot still needs to change.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0When Karin Prien's mother brought her to Germany as a little girl in the late 1960s, she gave her one urgent warning: \"Don't tell anyone you're Jewish.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, Prien is now post World War II Germany's first Jewish federal cabinet member, having been selected as the Minister for Education, Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth.",
      "Prien told CBS News she intends to use her platform to confront the rise of antisemitism in Germany and further afield, and the fragility of democracy in a country still reckoning with its past.",
      "\"Well, in a way, I'm proud,\" the minister told CBS News in a candid interview. \"Proud to be a minister in the federal government, but also that I'm recognized as Jewish and that German society is now so far [advanced] as to accept that Jewish people have a right to be a self-conscious part of this society.\"",
      "Prien's political career, and her personal story, represent an arc of conflict, tension and reconciliation that echoes that of post-Holocaust Germany itself.",
      "\"A question of responsibility\"",
      "Born in the Netherlands to Holocaust survivors, Prien moved to Germany at the age of 4. Even as a child, she was heavily aware of the silence surrounding her family's identity. Her mother's warning that it was still too dangerous to talk about being Jewish \u2014 more than two decades after the war ended \u2014 shaped her early years.",
      "\"There was always fear. My mother was afraid that there were too many Nazis still around,\" Prien said. \"It wasn't taken for granted that you could talk about being Jewish. It was something you kept inside the home.\"",
      "But that silence eventually became intolerable. As a young teen, she said she began to understand that the democratic values she cherished \u2014 freedom, human dignity, anti-discrimination\u2014- required defending.",
      "\"I decided, 'I have to do something about it. Democracy is not something you can take for granted,'\" she said.",
      "But Prien still waited decades before publicly acknowledging her Jewish identity.",
      "The turning point came in the early 2010s, when she was already a member of state parliament in Hamburg. Prien began pushing for systematic documentation of antisemitic incidents in schools. When a journalist asked why the issue mattered so much to her, she paused and then told him: \"Because I'm Jewish.\"",
      "\"That was the moment I realized I had a political voice,\" she recalled. \"I had some kind of influence. And for me, it was a question of responsibility.\"",
      "Lessons from the past for the threats of today",
      "That sense of responsibility weighs heavily on Prien in today's Germany, where she said antisemitism is no longer confined to the political fringes.",
      "\"We see rising antisemitism all over the world,\" Prien said. \"They dare to be openly antisemitic. I think it's now more than after the end of World War II. They dare to be openly antisemitic, and that's also in Germany getting stronger and stronger. That has changed. And so we have antisemitic tendencies on the margins, but we also have it in the middle of society.\"",
      "While Germany once appeared to be a model of historical reckoning, Prien said she fears complacency is setting in.",
      "After some \"honest decades,\" during which Prien says Germans confronted themselves with the stark realities of their country's history, \"now, people are dying. And now we have to find new ways to talk about that.\"",
      "Prien thinks that should include a shift in Holocaust education. She wants German schools to expand from their current focus on the atrocities of World War II to also teach the history of Israel, the cultural contributions of Jewish Germans, and the origins of antisemitism.",
      "\"Jewish identity is part of German identity,\" she told CBS News. \"Young people need to know that Jews are not only victims. Jewish people are diverse. They have a voice. They are part of this society.\"",
      "Prien said she draws inspiration from figures including Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, a Holocaust survivor who famously coined the phrase: \"Be Human.\"",
      "That, Prien said, should be the foundation of any education system in a democracy: teaching empathy and human dignity.",
      "But it's not only historical facts and universal dignity that need defending, she said, it's also Germany's democratic fabric.",
      "\"We are an immigration society,\" Prien said. \"But we're not very good at having fair and equal chances for children who start with more difficult conditions.\"",
      "She sees educational equity and national democratic resilience as intrinsically linked.",
      "Prien is now leading efforts to limit mobile phone use in German elementary schools, warning that parents and policymakers have been too naive about the risks of digital exposure for young people.",
      "\"We are anxious about the real world. We drive our kids to school and into the classrooms but we are not anxious about the stuff online,\" she said. \"That has to change.\"",
      "Asked what message she has for young Jews with political ambitions in Germany today, Prien didn't hesitate: \"Stay. Don't pack your luggage. This is a different Germany. This is a country where you can live safely. And it's our job to make that promise true every day.\"",

Ukrainian security forces told CBS News after Kirillov's death that Security Service of Ukraine killed him in a special operation, a claim that could not be independently verified but sparked Russian calls for revenge against Ukrainian leaders.",

    "summary": "Israel said the newly announced settlements\u200b in the occupied West Bank would include the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization.",
    "story": [
      "Israel said Thursday it would establish 22 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization. Neighboring Jordan and Britain slammed the move, with a top U.K. official calling it a \"deliberate obstacle\" to Palestinian statehood.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip  and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The majority of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \"strengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\" using the biblical term for the West Bank. He said it \"anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\"",
      "He added that the construction of settlements was also \"a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\"",
      "The Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now said the announcement was the most extensive move of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the now-defunct peace process. It said the settlements, which are deep inside the territory, would \"dramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation even further.\"",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Peace Now said the plans call for the authorization of 12 existing outposts, the development of nine new settlements and reclassifying a neighborhood of an existing settlement as a separate one.",
      "\"The government is making clear \u2014 again and without restraint \u2014 that it prefers deepening the occupation and advancing de facto annexation over pursuing peace,\" the group said.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which ignited the war in Gaza. The settlements have confined\u00a0Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and made the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",
      "A spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the move a \"dangerous escalation\" and accused Israel of moving the region into a \"cycle of violence and instability.\"",
      "\"This extremist Israeli government is trying by all means to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,\" the spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a statement, Hamas \u2014 the group that the U.S. and Israel have designated as terrorists that controls Gaza \u2014 accused Israel of \"an acceleration of efforts to Judaize Palestinian land as part of an explicit annexation project.\"",
      "\"It constitutes a brazen challenge to international will and a grave violation of international law and United Nations resolutions,\" said the Palestinian militant group.",
      "Western ally Jordan also condemned the move as illegal, and said it \"undermines prospects for peace by entrenching the occupation.\"",
      "The Jordanian foreign ministry warned that \"such unilateral actions further erode the viability of a two-state solution by impeding the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state.\"",
      "Britain's minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, slammed the decision as a \"deliberate obstacle to Palestinian statehood,\" saying settlements \"imperil the two state solution, and do not protect Israel.\"",
      "During his first term, President Trump's administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel's claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth.",
      "The top United Nations court ruled last year that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is unlawful and called on it to end, and for settlement construction to stop immediately.",
      "Israel denounced the non-binding opinion by a 15-judge panel of the International Court of Justice, saying the territories are part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people.",
      "Israel withdrew its settlements from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but leading figures in the current government have called for them to be re-established and for much of the Palestinian population of the territory to be resettled elsewhere through what they describe as voluntary emigration.",
      "Palestinians view such plans as a blueprint for their forcible expulsion from their homeland, and experts say the plans would likely violate international law.",
      "Israel now controls more than 70% of Gaza, according to Yaakov Garb, a professor of environmental studies at Ben Gurion University, who has examined Israeli-Palestinian land use patterns for decades.",
      "The area includes buffer zones along the border with Israel as well as the southern city of Rafah, which is now mostly uninhabited, and other large areas that Israel has ordered to be evacuated.",
      "The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which terrorists stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be still alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israeli forces have rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies.",

      "The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration works to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a series of restrictions on international students.",
      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",
      "The memo was first reported by Politico.",
      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A 19-year-old New Zealand man has died after taking part in a new tackling game that's trending on social media  in which competitors run at each other and collide while wearing no protective equipment. Police confirmed Ryan Satterthwaite suffered a head injury on Sunday while playing a backyard game with friends in the North Island city of Palmerston North. He died on Monday as a result of his injuries.",
      "Area police commander Inspector Ross Grantham described Satterthwaite's death as \"a huge tragedy\" and urged others to \"consider the significant safety and injury risks\" of the game that is known as RUNIT or RUNIT Straight.",
      "\"A young man lost his life as a result of participating in what I understand to be a social media frenzy,\" Grantham said. \"While this is not a criminal matter, police will continue to undertake inquiries on behalf of the coroner.\"",
      "Grantham said \"the tackle game played by the group of friends was based on a social media-driven trend where participants compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear.",
      "\"While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity.\"",
      "RUNIT is based loosely on the contact elements of rugby union, rugby league or the NFL and involves two competitors, a runner and a tackler, running at each other and colliding on a 65 foot by 13 foot area known as a battlefield.",
      "The game has grown in social media popularity through the Australian RUNIT Championship League, which offers cash prizes to competitors. Organizers promote the event as \"the world's fiercest new collision sport.\"",
      "Two trial events in Auckland in recent weeks saw eight men compete for 20,000 New Zealand dollars ($12,000) in front of more than 1,000 spectators. Winners were expected to go into a championship event next month with prize money of up to 250,000 New Zealand dollars ($150,000).",
      "Two other events in Auckland were canceled when organizers were unable to obtain permits.",
      "The RUNIT Championship League released a statement to the New Zealand news website Stuff on Tuesday, saying it \"does not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions.\"",
      "\"This is tragic news and our hearts go out to the family and friends of Ryan. Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments which include professional medical supervision and support.\"",
      "RUNIT has been strongly condemned by experts in head injuries who say competitors run a high risk of a serious brain injury.",
      "It is by no means the first social media-fueled trend to draw safety warnings after a tragedy. Medical experts have been forced to warn people, and young people in particular, about the risks of everything from inhaling solvents to abusing over-the-counter medications and even snorting condoms.",

      "The documents claimed that the accusers had asked for and received concert tickets to the Motown legend's concerts for themselves and their families. The lawsuit included displays of text messages that were allegedly sent by the accusers to the Robinsons. The texts featured birthday wishes, expressions of love and an invitation to a son's graduation.",
      "\"The Robinsons did not abuse, harm, or take advantage of Plaintiffs; they treated Plaintiffs with the utmost kindness and generosity,\" the lawsuit stated. \"Unfortunately, the depths of Plaintiffs\u2019 avarice and greed knows no bounds.\"",
      "Smokey Robinson's second wife, Frances Robinson, was also accused in the original lawsuit. (Frazer Harrison)",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the accusers, with the assistance of their law firm Harris & Hayden, had initially sought $100 million from the Robinsons prior to filing their lawsuit. After the accusers' demands were not met, they filed the lawsuit and \"created a media circus and made a public spectacle of themselves,\" the lawsuit stated.",
      "The documents referenced a press conference that was given by the accusers' attorneys on May 6 and attended by three of the four Jane Does.",
      "\"With the assistance of their legal counsel, they paraded themselves in front of the media, wearing sunglasses and face masks for full dramatic effect,\" the lawsuit read. \"Their counsel, John Harris, with no firsthand knowledge and without reference to the Complaint they had filed, went on to claim publicly that Mr. Robinson was a 'serial and sick rapist' and a 'serial assaulter.'\"",

That safe and the valuables it contained and several gold Kruggerands were later stolen by someone who knew precisely where they were located. The Robinsons reported the theft to the police.\"",
      "Additionally, the Robinsons' lawyers state that Frances had discovered that she was missing financial records, including bank statements, and noted \"at least one Plaintiff had access to and knew exactly where these records were kept.\"",

This type of retaliatory litigation is precisely what California\u2019s anti-SLAPP laws were enacted to prevent.",
      "\"Jane Does 1-4 exercised their fundamental constitutional right to seek redress through the courts by filing a civil action to expose and hold accountable behavior that no one should have to endure,\" they continued. \"In response, Mr. Robinson, filed a cross-complaint that mischaracterizes the facts and seeks to punish his victims for speaking out.\"",

      "\"My message to them has been that putting extremely elderly politicians like Steny Hoyer back into office for a 24th term sends a message to voters across the country that Democrats are just the party of status quo and clearly that message has not been working,\" he said.",

      "Emotions are running high on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill as Elon Musk makes his way for the exit.",
      "Musk is stepping back from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which President Donald Trump appointed the tech billionaire to run for the first 130 days of his new administration.",
      "He's been a polarizing figure in Washington, and that has extended to his announcement earlier this week that he's returning to the private sector. Republicans cheered Musk's work, while Democrats celebrated the end of it.",
      "\"Exposing reckless, wasteful government spending isn\u2019t about one individual \u2014 it\u2019s about a lasting overhaul of Crazy Town,\" House DOGE Caucus Chair Aaron Bean, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital. \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re working closely with the White House to ensure recession packages reflect DOGE\u2019s critical findings.\"",

      "And the White House has begun that work already, preparing a $9.4 billion package of spending cuts that's expected to hit Congress on Tuesday. But Bean's comments imply Republicans are going to seek more.",
      "It was a sentiment that appeared to be shared by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said that Musk \"did a lot of what he came to do.\"",
      "\"A lot of the savings that he identified are things hopefully that we\u2019ll be able to incorporate into bills that Congress passes. The work that he did was really important. It\u2019s long overdue,\" Thune said.",
      "Senate DOGE Caucus Chair Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said she was \"honored\" to work with Musk but signaled he should not be needed for lawmakers to cut government waste.",
      "\"It has been wonderful having a willing partner in my decade-long work to make Washington squeal, but I was DOGE before DOGE was cool, and I\u2019m not slowing down,\" Ernst told Fox News Digital in a statement.",
      "Other Republicans were more lavish in their praise, like Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., who hailed Musk as an \"American hero.\"",
      "\"I'm absolutely sad to see him go,\" Haridopolos told Fox News Digital. \"He has given up a lot of time and wealth in order to bring the fiscal house of the United States in order, and he has done a great service to our country by bringing a heck of a lot more transparency of how we're spending money.\"",
      "And Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., compared the billionaire to the nation's revered first leaders.",
      "Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., helped found the House's DOGE Caucus. (House of Representatives/Getty Images)",
      "\"He's kind of half Benjamin Franklin and half Thomas Jefferson. He had the inventiveness of Benjamin Franklin and the vision of a Thomas Jefferson, and I just remember all of our founding fathers were patriots, and they left their regular jobs. They gave up everything to come help found this country. And that's what Elon's [done],\" Marshall told Fox News Digital.",
      "On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., pointed out that as much as Republicans lauded Musk, he also dealt a blow to the House GOP earlier this week by criticizing their \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill.",
      "\"They brought Musk to DC to fight the deficit, and he left DC calling out how the reconciliation bill will blow the biggest hole in the deficit ever \u2014 adding more than $3 trillion in debt,\" Suozzi told Fox News Digital.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told Fox News Digital he believed DOGE's efforts were misplaced in the end.",
      "MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET \u2018BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL\u2019 WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE",
      "\"Initially, I said we should work with Musk to find common ground where there is real waste \u2014 like defense contractors, Medicare Advantage overpayments, and prescription drugs. It is sad that DOGE faced opposition in focusing on those issues, and that agencies like USAID and NIH are being dismantled,\" Khanna said.",
      "Others on the left unleashed on Musk directly.",
      "Democrats have held up the Tesla CEO as a boogeyman since he began campaigning for Trump, using him as a living example of the wealthy, out-of-touch people they believed the Republican White House was benefitting.",
      "\"Elon came to Washington thinking he could run the government like one of his companies\u2014firing people left and right, gutting essential services, and tearing this s--- up from the ground up,\" Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, wrote on X, calling for an investigation into Musk's work.",

      "\"Musk\u2019s exit is an enormous victory for Democrats and working people. This is a sign of how powerful the anti-corruption, anti-billionaire movement in American politics can be,\" Casar said in a statement. \"Musk did not choose to leave because Elon Musk likes to follow the rules. Musk will leave because the American people built enough political pressure that he had no choice.\"",
      "And Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, wrote on X, \"Musk failed others and served himself.\"",
      "\"But there\u2019s an irony in his failure: in his quest to destroy government, he reminded us why it matters. To look out for hungry kids, to keep planes safe, to deliver Social Security checks, and to do the quiet work to serve the common good,\" Booker said.",
      "When reached for comment on this story, White House spokesman Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital, \"DOGE is integral to the federal government\u2019s operations, and its mission, as established by the President\u2019s executive order, will continue under the direction of agency and department heads in the Trump administration. DOGE has delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented pace, and its work is far from complete.\" Fox News Digital also reached out to Tesla for comment from Musk.",
      "Trump, for his part, heaped praise on Musk at a joint press conference on Friday.",
      "\"Elon\u2019s\u00a0service to America has been without comparison in modern history. He's already running one of the most innovative car companies in the world, if you look at his factories and compare them with some of the old factories we have, and it's a big difference. And the most successful space company, I guess in history, you would have to say. The largest free speech platform on the internet,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Yet, Elon, willingly, with all of the success, he willingly accepted the outrageous abuse and slander and lies and attacks because he does love our country.\"",

Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates?

      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds.

      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",

      "WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT",
      "From GitHub takedown to a fresh build",
      "Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

Whether it's summarizing complex ideas, designing a birthday card or even planning your apartment's layout, you can get impressive results with just a simple prompt.

No special commands or coding needed, just type what you want to know or do, and they respond. For example, asking \"Why is the conclave kept secret?\" will get you a detailed explanation in seconds.",
      "This simplicity is what makes LLMs so useful, but it also opens the door to risks. Instead of harmless questions, someone could ask for a detailed profile on a person, and the model might generate a surprisingly thorough report. While these tools have safeguards and often refuse certain requests, clever phrasing can sometimes bypass those limits.",

      "And that\u2019s it. The removal process is entirely automated and requires little to no effort on your part. With this small initial effort, you may save yourself from privacy-related risks, including scams and even\u00a0identity theft. But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",
      "A man looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Aggressive US rollout targets 180M users",
      "World ID is currently available in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, Miami and San Francisco, with plans to expand further. The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users. While the technology promises enhanced security, the debate over its privacy implications continues to grow.",

      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms. However, the storage of sensitive biometric data in a global database will always raise concerns for many.",

      "Imagine your phone rings and the voice on the other end sounds just like your boss, a close friend, or even a government official. They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.",
      "That's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",
      "From hijacked AI accounts and manipulated models to live video scams and data poisoning, the report paints a picture of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, one that's touching more lives than ever before.",

      "Illustration of cybersecurity risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "Criminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include:",
      "Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitationsPhrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenariosAsking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",

      "Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios",
      "Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",

      "Poisoned AI models are spreading misinformation",
      "Sometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens:",

      "A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.",

      "1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:\u00a0Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "TURN ANY BIKE INTO AN E-BIKE IN SECONDS WITH THIS NIFTY GADGET",
      "A new kind of urban mobility",
      "The Acticycle is not just about impressive specs, though. It is about reimagining how we move through our cities. Unlike most bikes, the Acticycle is built for companionship and comfort. The two ergonomic seats are designed to make even long rides enjoyable, so you and a friend can chat and relax on your way to work or out on the town. The seating is plush and supportive, which means you can say goodbye to the aches and pains that come with traditional cycling.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "READY TO UNLEASH YOUR INNER MAVERICK WITH THE THRILLING AIRWOLF HOVERBIKE",
      "Designed for all-weather comfort",
      "One of the most frustrating things about biking in the city is dealing with the weather. The Acticycle takes care of that with a full canopy, roof, and windshield that keep you dry and protected from rain and splashes. Mudguards help keep the mess off your clothes, so you can show up at your destination looking as fresh as when you left home. This weather protection means you do not have to worry about rain gear or last-minute wardrobe changes, making the Acticycle a true year-round solution.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "A PEDAL-ELECTRIC HYBRID THAT'S HALF BIKE, HALF CAR",
      "Agility without compromise",
      "Despite its four wheels, the Acticycle is surprisingly agile. Its tight steering angle and low center of gravity let you weave through traffic, navigate narrow bike lanes, and handle sharp corners with ease. Even when you are carrying a full load of passengers or cargo, the Acticycle maintains stable and responsive handling, so you always feel in control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Power and range",
      "Range anxiety is a thing of the past with the Acticycle. The removable batteries can be charged at home with a standard outlet, and swapping them out is quick and simple. With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "How much storage does this thing have",
      "City living often means making tough choices about what you can carry with you. The Acticycle makes that a non-issue. With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "What does the Acticycle cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Acticycle really feels like a breath of fresh air for city life. It takes the best parts of both cars and bikes and rolls them into one practical, comfortable, and eco-friendly package. With its weather protection, roomy storage, and smooth ride, it makes daily commuting or running errands so much easier and more enjoyable. You get to skip the hassle of traffic jams, parking headaches, and high fuel costs, all while doing your part for the environment.",

      "We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky.",
      "Now, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers.",

      "The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center published\u00a0a public service announcement on May 7, 2025, cautioning both individuals and organizations that criminals are taking advantage of outdated routers that no longer receive security patches.",
      "Devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously.",
      "In essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame.",

      "WHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE?",
      "How hackers exploit these routers",
      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from router hackers",
      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.",

      "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.",
      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",
      "Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it\u2019s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:",
      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.",
      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

      "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with Argentine President Javier Milei on Tuesday at the Casa Rosada, where both leaders reaffirmed plans to withdraw their nations from the World Health Organization (WHO) and build a new international health framework.",
      "The meeting brought together two strong-willed political outsiders. Milei, a libertarian economist known for cutting government spending, and Kennedy, a Trump-appointed health chief skeptical of pandemic-era mandates. Both promised to challenge what they call global overreach and politicized health policy.",
      "Argentina officially confirmed its exit from the WHO during Kennedy\u2019s visit, following Milei\u2019s initial announcement in February.

      "Milei\u2019s government blasted the WHO for what it called a failed COVID response. \"The WHO\u2019s prescriptions do not work because they are not based on science but on political interests and bureaucratic structures that refuse to review their own mistakes,\" the government said, referring to the group\u2019s lockdown strategy as a \"caveman quarantine.\"",
      "Kennedy offered support, encouraging other countries to also exit the WHO in a recent address to the World Health Assembly. He has argued the organization is compromised by foreign governments and corporate interests, and that a fresh approach is needed.",
      "After the meeting, Kennedy posted on X: \"I had a wonderful meeting with President Milei about the mutual withdrawal of our nations from the WHO and the creation of an alternative international health system... free from totalitarian impulses, corruption, and political control.\"",

      "The meeting also highlighted shared philosophies between the two leaders. Milei took office vowing to slash Argentina\u2019s massive public spending. He famously carried a chainsaw during his campaign to symbolize budget cuts\u2014and has since followed through, cutting public salaries, halting state projects, and ending energy subsidies.",
      "His tough measures have produced results: Argentina posted its first budget surplus in nearly 15 years and sharply reduced monthly inflation.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s MAHA campaign echoes Milei\u2019s anti-establishment style, but in the health sector. The Trump administration\u2019s health agenda has focused on rolling back federal overreach, enforcing science-based policy, and promoting transparency in public health.",

Milei identifies his political philosophy as libertarian. (@SecKennedy via X)",
      "Tuesday\u2019s meeting marks a deeper alignment between Argentina and the current U.S. administration. Milei has welcomed top American officials in recent months and shown clear interest in building strong ties with Washington. Now, by joining the U.S. in rejecting the WHO, Milei becomes the first foreign leader to openly back Trump\u2019s health sovereignty push.",
      "The decision is a major departure from Argentina\u2019s previous international partnerships and could signal a shift for other countries weighing similar moves. Both Milei and Kennedy have framed the initiative as the start of a more accountable and independent global health network.",
      "Critics, including some in Argentina\u2019s opposition, warn that leaving the WHO could limit access to funding and vaccines. Global health experts largely defend the WHO\u2019s role, despite acknowledging its COVID missteps.",

    "summary": "A Colorado man\u2019s emergency stomach surgery highlights the exceedingly complex \u2014 and sometimes inaccurate \u2014 system of pricing at some hospitals.",
    "story": [
      "After Blake Pfeifer, a veteran plumber in Colorado Springs, Colorado, underwent emergency stomach surgery at a nearby nonprofit hospital in 2022, he struggled to understand the bills flooding in for his weeklong stay.",
      "The initial charge for the procedure at the University of Colorado Health Memorial Hospital Central was $104,000, his records show. Because Pfeifer had no insurance and would be paying out of pocket, he was quoted a discounted price of $58,124.",
      "He said he called the hospital to get clarity on the bills but got nowhere. He began paying some of them and was pursued by a collection agency on others. Then he sought the help of a patient advocacy group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always paid my bills,\u201d Pfeifer, 63, said. \u201cI wanted a little better explanation.\u201d",
      "The group he worked with, Patient Rights Advocate.org, found that some of his charges were far higher than the amounts UCHealth reported under a federal price transparency\u00a0rule\u00a0that went into effect in 2021. And that wasn\u2019t the only notable finding: Only 25% of Pfeifer\u2019s charges showed up on the hospital\u2019s required price list and therefore could not be compared at all.",
      "Pfeifer\u2019s experience is not uncommon, according to patient advocates, public interest lawyers and Medicare data.",
      "The burden of medical debt, a problem faced by 100 million Americans, has pushed many to delay medical care and even file for bankruptcy, research shows. Making these obligations even more ruinous, patient advocates say, is that many may be based on inaccurate health care bills. These discrepancies occur even as hospitals must list prices for care on their websites.",
      "The price transparency rule,\u00a0initiated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\u00a0requires facilities to\u00a0\u201cestablish, update, and make public a list of all standard charges for all items and services.\u201d\u00a0Implemented under the first Trump administration, it aims\u00a0to help consumers shop for care and compare prices before they go to the hospital.",
      "Now, four years after the rule went into effect, hospital billing seems \u201cintentionally complex,\u201d said Cynthia Fisher, founder of\u00a0Patient Rights Advocate.org.",
      "\u201cHospitals and insurance companies alike have even hired many middle-player firms to be able to maximize their margins and profits at every single patient encounter,\u201d she added. \u201cSometimes what we\u2019re finding is the charges like Blake\u2019s that are billed are far beyond even the highest rate that they have within their hospital pricing file.\u201d",
      "It adds up to an increasingly costly health care experience for Americans. A West Health-Gallup\u00a0survey\u00a0published April 2 found that 35% of respondents said they could not access high-quality, affordable health care \u2014 a new high since 2021.",
      "$99 for an $8 blood test",
      "UCHealth is a nonprofit hospital system with 14 hospitals in Colorado, southern Wyoming and western Nebraska. In its financial filings, UCHealth says its discount program for self-pay patients like Pfeifer \u201creduces\u00a0uninsured patients\u2019 liabilities to a level more equivalent of insured patients.\u201d",
      "Some of Pfeifer\u2019s\u00a0records conflict with this description.",
      "Pfeifer received 10 common blood tests, known as a metabolic panel, and was billed $104 for each. By comparison, UCHealth\u2019s public price data shows it charged insured patients between $6.52 and $52.89 for each test in 2022.",
      "In another case, Pfeifer was charged $99 for a blood culture to measure bacteria, the records show, while UCHealth\u2019s pricing data listed a range of charges for insured patients of between $8 and $61. For a phosphate level blood test, Pfeifer was billed $30, while insured patients at UCHealth were charged between $3.72 and $22.02.",
      "Under Colorado\u00a0law,\u00a0violations of hospital price transparency requirements are a deceptive trade practice.",
      "Dan Weaver, a UCHealth spokesman, said in a statement that the health system \u201cdoes everything possible to share prices and estimates with our patients, encourage insurance coverage, assist patients in applying for Medicaid and other programs that may offer coverage.\u201d",
      "Regarding Pfeifer\u2019s case, Weaver said he could not comment because the hospital had received notice from a lawyer representing Pfeifer that he may file a claim against it. He said the hospital disputes what is in the lawyer\u2019s notice, but he declined to specify what exactly it disputes.",
      "Weaver pointed to the\u00a0state of Colorado\u2019s 2024 report stating that UCHealth hospitals \u201care fully compliant with transparency requirements.\u201d For 2022, when Pfeifer received care at UCHealth, the document showed the hospital providing his care received a \u201cfair\u201d transparency rating by the state, above \u201cpoor\u201d but below \u201cgood.\u201d",
      "Weaver added that CMS, which determines hospital compliance with transparency requirements, \u201chas not cited UCHealth or our hospitals for noncompliance.\u201d",
      "Enforcement actions are exceedingly rare. CMS\u2019 website lists\u00a0monetary penalties\u00a0against only 27 hospitals in the four years since the requirements began. (There are 6,000 hospitals nationwide, according to the\u00a0American Hospital Association.)",
      "A December 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that nearly 40% of the 100 hospitals it studied were not complying with the price transparency requirements.",
      "Colorado\u00a0law\u00a0allows patients to sue a hospital bringing a debt collection proceeding against them when they believe the facilities have violated price transparency requirements. Steve Woodrow,\u00a0a Democratic member of the\u00a0Colorado\u00a0House of Representatives\u00a0and a lawyer at\u00a0the firm Edelson\u00a0in Denver, represents Pfeifer.",
      "\u201cWhat happened to Mr. Pfeifer unfortunately repeats itself and plays out across the country thousands of times every year,\u201d Woodrow told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe now have a situation where people are afraid to get medical care because of the financial ramifications.\u201d",
      "'A power imbalance'",
      "Last November, the Justice Department\u00a0alleged\u00a0that UCHealth had overbilled Medicare and TRICARE, the health insurer for U.S. service members and their families. Between November 2017 and March 31, 2021, the government alleged, providers at UCHealth hospitals submitted inflated Medicare and TRICARE claims for \u201cfrequent monitoring of vital signs\u201d among patients in the emergency department.",
      "UCHealth agreed to pay $23 million to settle the allegations without an admission of liability.",
      "Weaver, the UCHealth spokesperson, said the hospital system settled to prevent a lengthy and costly legal dispute.",
      "\u201cUCHealth firmly denies these allegations,\u201d he added, \u201cand maintains that its billing practices align with the guidelines set forth by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\u201d",
      "While UCHealth is a nonprofit, it has generated rising revenues and earnings recently. Net patient revenues at UCHealth, its\u00a0securities\u00a0filings show, totaled $8 billion in fiscal 2024, 17% higher than the previous year. Operating income was $523 million, an increase of 58% over 2023.",
      "UCHealth\u2019s charges for care are higher than most other nonprofits\u2019, Medicare\u00a0data shows. In fiscal 2022, the most recent figures available, UCHealth charged patients 6.6 times the hospital system\u2019s costs for care. That is far higher than the 4 times, on average, that U.S. nonprofit health systems charged for care that year, according to Ge Bai,\u00a0a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "Weaver, of UCHealth, said the hospital system\u2019s charges are competitive with others. \u201cLast year alone, UCHealth provided $1.3 billion in total community benefits including about $570 million in uncompensated care,\u201d his statement said.",
      "It\u2019s problem enough for patients who are overcharged or billed incorrectly for health care. But when hospitals sue to receive payment for those bills, such lawsuits often result in default judgments, legal experts say, issued to patients who don\u2019t appear in court or respond. Default judgments can have dire consequences, including wage garnishments.",
      "UCHealth has sued thousands of patients using third parties or debt collection middlemen in recent years, a practice that is examined in\u00a0new research by academics at\u00a0the\u00a0George Washington University Law School, Stanford University\u2019s\u00a0Clinical Excellence Research\u00a0Center and Fisher\u2019s group.",
      "The study, \u201cHospitals Suing Patients: The Rise of Stealth Intermediaries,\u201d found UCHealth and one debt collection firm brought 12,722 lawsuits against patients from 2019 to 2023. Legal records analyzed by the authors suggested \u201cmany of the collection efforts were based on unsubstantiated and inaccurate billing records.\u201d",
      "The use of legal middlemen is a national trend and allows hospitals to hide their involvement, avoiding the bad publicity these lawsuits can bring, the research contends. Last year, Colorado lawmakers enacted\u00a0legislation\u00a0barring hospitals from suing patients under debt collectors\u2019 names, after an\u00a0investigation\u00a0into the practice by 9News, an NBC affiliate, and The Colorado Sun.",
      "Barak Richman\u00a0is the Alexander Hamilton professor of business law at George Washington Law School and a co-author of the study.",
      "\u201cWhat this research shows is people are being pulled into court where a power imbalance takes advantage of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be a lot of deliberative thought into what to do about courts as it relates to medical debt.\u201d",
      "In a statement about the study, UCHealth\u2019s Weaver said those suits make up a \u201ctiny fraction of our patient care \u2014 in fact, more than 99.93% of all patient accounts are resolved without a lawsuit.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis study, based on older data, does not reflect the changes put in place in recent years to minimize billing errors, ensure patients are aware of our financial assistance options, and are well informed of their medical bills.\u201d",
      "'A principle thing'",
      "Damon Carson, a small-business owner in Longmont, Colorado, was sued by a collection company after he received an outpatient endoscopy at a UCHealth hospital in his town. The suit came while he was disputing the hospital\u2019s charges as excessive.",
      "A self-pay patient along with his wife, Traci, Carson tried to be a savvy shopper before he went in for the procedure in 2021. He asked for price estimates from several providers, and the nearby UCHealth facility provided one totaling $1,448, according to a court document. Carson paid upfront.",
      "\u201cI had the procedure and everything was fine,\u201d Carson told NBC News. \u201cThen the bills started rolling in.\u201d",
      "Additional charges of $4,742 drove the total cost for the procedure to around $6,200, a court document shows.",
      "Carson said that when he questioned the bills, noting the far lower original estimate, the hospital told him the add-on costs reflected the removal of growths found inside him during surgery.",
      "A UCHealth spokesman said the original estimate for Carson\u2019s care was accurate and that he was told there might be additional charges and signed an acknowledgement of that, which the hospital provided to NBC News. (Carson says he recalls no discussion of the potential for additional charges.)",
      "When Carson refused to pay, he was sued by Collection Center Inc., a debt collection firm that has often filed lawsuits against patients on behalf of the hospital, the academic study shows. In 2023, Carson and the collection firm conducted a mediation, according to court documents. Carson wound up paying only one-third of the additional charges to settle the case.",
      "\u201cI was surprised they caved that fast,\u201d Carson told NBC News. \u201cTraci and I could easily have paid the $4,000 and our lives gone on. But this was a principle thing.\u201d",
      "Fisher, the patient advocate, said the outcome of Carson\u2019s case is revealing.\u00a0\u201cNo one should ever pay that first bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe onus of proof needs to be on the hospital and the insurance company to prove that they have not overcharged us.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is escalating its social media vetting of visa applicants seeking to travel to Harvard University, a State Department cable sent to diplomatic posts Friday shows.",
      "The cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructs all U.S. missions and consulates abroad to immediately enhance the vetting of such visa applicants, with the intention of expanding the scrutiny process over time.",
      "The vetting will go beyond student applicants, according to the cable seen by NBC News, as it also includes faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and tourists.",
      "The stepped-up vetting is intended to \"address acute concerns of violence and anti-Semitism at Harvard University\" and calls for vetting of \"any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose,\" the cable states. Non-immigrant visas are for temporary entry to the U.S.",
      "In response to an NBC News request for comment on the cable, a  State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe Department does not comment on internal communications.\u201d",
      "NBC News also has contacted Harvard for comment.",
      "For the expanded social media screening, consular offices have been told to identify applicants with \u201chistories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence, and to duly consider their visa eligibility under U.S. immigration law.\u201d",
      "In those instructions, the cable criticizes what the administration described as Harvard\u2019s failure to maintain a campus environment \u201cfree from violence and anti-Semitism.\"",
      "The cable instructs U.S. consular officers to ask visa applicants to set all their social media accounts to public in the event that they need to be reviewed as part of the vetting.",
      "The State Department also instructed officers to \u201cconsider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to 'private' or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant\u2019s credibility.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, the administration stopped scheduling new interviews for international students seeking visas to study in the U.S. The halt on interviews was intended as a precursor to the expanded social media screening, allowing diplomatic and consular posts to prepare for the larger and adjusted workload.",
      "The vetting  is another volley by the administration in its ongoing battle with Harvard and other universities.",
      "Harvard has fought back against the administration's attempts to control the university's hiring and admissions, diversity outreach and initiatives and foreign student enrollment. The administration has cut billions in research to pressure Harvard to cede to its demands.",
      "On Thursday, a court extended its bar on the Trump administration's attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The administration said in its cable that the stepped-up social media vetting of visa applicants to Harvard is a pilot program that could be expanded.",
      "Other groups of visa applicants could be included later, the administration said in its cable.",
      "Foreign students have been targeted by the administration, stripped of visas and arrested, detained and deported, including those who protested Israel's military response since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "Rubio said on Wednesday that the State Department would work with the Department of Homeland Security to \"aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students.\""

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific that they won't be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure from China.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure from China, while insisting that they also contribute more to their own defense.",
      "He said Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan. China has conducted numerous exercises to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own and the U.S. has pledged to defend.",
      "China\u2019s army \u201cis rehearsing for the real deal,\u201d Hegseth said in a keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore. \u201cWe are not going to sugarcoat it \u2014 the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d",
      "China has a stated goal of having its military have the capability to take Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an aspirational goal than a hard war deadline.",
      "But China also has built sophisticated man-made islands in the South China Sea to support new military outposts and developed highly advanced hypersonic and space capabilities, which are driving the United States to create its own space-based \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defenses.",
      "Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it\u2019s \u201cactively training for it, every day.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also called out China for its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its influence over the Panama Canal.",
      "He urged countries in the region to increase defense spending to levels similar to the 5% of their gross domestic product European nations are now pressed to contribute.",
      "\u201cWe must all do our part,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Following the speech, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat Kaja Kallas pushed back at Hegseth\u2019s comment that European countries should focus their defense efforts in their own region and leave the Indo-Pacific more to the U.S. She said that with North Korean troops fighting for Russia and China supporting Moscow, European and Asian security were \u201cvery much interlinked.\u201d",
      "He also repeated a pledge made by previous administrations to bolster U.S. military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific to provide a more robust deterrent. While both the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to the Pacific and established new military agreements throughout the region, a full shift has never been realized.",
      "Instead, U.S. military resources from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military needs in the Middle East and Europe, especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In the first few months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, that\u2019s also been the case.",
      "In the last few months the Trump administration has taken a Patriot missile defense battalion out of the Indo-Pacific in order to send it to the Middle East, a massive logistical operation that required 73 military cargo aircraft flights, and sent Coast Guard ships back to the U.S. to help defend the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Hegseth also cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S. military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk.",
      "\u201cEconomic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Asked how he would reconcile that statement with Trump\u2019s threat of steep tariffs on most in the region, Hegseth he was \u201cin the business of tanks, not trade.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s Defense Minister Richard Marles welcomed Hegseth\u2019s assurance that the Indo-Pacific was an American strategic priority and agreed that Australia and other nations needed to do their part.",
      "\u201cReality is that there is no effective balance of power in this region absent the United States, but we cannot leave it to the United States alone,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Marles suggested the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive trade policies were counterproductive. \u201cThe shock and disruption from the high tariffs has been costly and destabilizing.\u201d",
      "China usually sends its own defense minister to this conference, but Dong Jun did not attend this year in a snub to the U.S. over the erratic tariff war Trump has ignited with Beijing. Their absence was something the U.S. delegation said it intended to capitalize on.",
      "\u201cWe are here this morning. And somebody else isn\u2019t,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth said committing U.S. support for Indo-Pacific nations would not require local governments to align with the West on cultural or climate issues.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the U.S. can or wants to supplant China as the region\u2019s primary economic driver. But Hegseth\u2019s push follows Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East, which resulted in billions of dollars in new defense agreements."

      "A salmonella outbreak traced to a Florida-based cucumber producer has expanded to include 45 people reporting illness in 18 states, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday.",
      "Target stores joined a growing list of retailers that sold recalled cucumbers or ready-to-eat products featuring the fruit, and it's warning that purchasers should throw them away.",
      "The retailer issued a list of recalled products, including a Greek-style chicken salad from Boar's Head and several types of sushi restaurant staples, such as maki rolls with tempura and California rolls, all sold under the Mai brand.",
      "Last week, grocery store chain Walmart was added to the list of retailers urging customers to put the possibly tainted products in the trash, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; its Marketside cucumber slices are a part of the recall.",
      "Patients connected to the outbreak have turned up in Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, the FDA said on Friday.",
      "Of 45 people who have reported illness connected to the outbreak, 16 have been hospitalized, the agency said. No deaths have been reported.",
      "While investigators' focus has been on the strain salmonella montevideo, multiple other strains were detected in samples taken from a Pennsylvania distribution center belonging to Florida-based Bedner Growers, believed to be a source, the FDA said in its Friday statement.",
      "The FDA said that those different strains so far appear to be unrelated to the spring outbreak, but that it is investigating further alongside scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"CDC is working to determine if additional human illnesses match these additional strains,\" the FDA said. \"Further analysis of the sample is pending.\"",
      "All the illnesses so far have been connected to cucumbers produced by Bedner and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, the agency said. The cucumbers and products that contained them were sold from April 29 to May 19, the FDA said.",
      "The first retailers noted for selling the potentially tainted cucumbers were three Bedner\u2019s Farm Fresh Market locations in Florida, but the list of public-facing sellers has continued to increase.",
      "Other distributors as well as eateries were told they may have also purchased the possibly tainted cucumbers, labeled for wholesale as \u201csupers,\u201d \u201cselects,\u201d or \u201cplains,\" the FDA said.",
      "FDA inspectors unearthed tainted cucumbers during an inspection last month of Bedner Growers' facilities, it said. The review was a follow-up to a Salmonella Africana outbreak linked to the producer last year, according to the agency.",
      "Bedner's did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday. A spokesperson for Fresh Start Produce Sales said last week that the company \"is committed to protecting public health and helping Bedner Growers with its recall.\"",
      "Salmonella is a bacterium that can thrive amid animals and their fecal matter and contaminate nearby produce, which can reach the dinner table if unwashed, according to the FDA and CDC.",
      "Older people, children under 5, and those with compromised immune systems are particularly susceptible to the salmonella's worst symptoms and even death. Patients sickened by it can develop stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea and the urge to vomit anywhere from six hours to six days after infection, the CDC says.",
      "Salmonella is \u201ca leading cause of foodborne illness, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States and worldwide,\" the CDC states."

      "His daughter Kaarin Clausen told The Associated Press that Alf Clausen died Thursday at his home in Los Angeles after struggling with Parkinson\u2019s disease for about a decade. He was 84.",
      "Clausen, who also scored TV series including \u201cMoonlighting\u201d and \u201cAlf\u201d (\u201cno relation,\u201d he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d He won twice.",
      "Al Jean, an early \u201cSimpsons\u201d writer who was one of the key creative figures on the show in the 1990s, said in a post on X Friday that \u201cClausen was an incredibly talented man who did so much for The Simpsons.\u201d",
      "Danny Elfman wrote the show\u2019s theme song, but Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio",
      "His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show\u2019s comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible.",
      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",
      "Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him \u201cone of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.\u201d",
      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\u201d the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998. He also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A sexual assault allegation was made against Motown legend Smokey Robinson in 2015, but no charges were filed because of insufficient evidence, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office said.",
      "The decade-old allegation, which was presented to the prosecutor\u2019s office by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, is not connected to a recent civil suit that accuses Robinson of sexual assault, attorneys for the plaintiffs in that matter said.",
      "Robinson, 85, has not been charged with any crime and has denied any misconduct. The celebrity news website TMZ was first to report the 2015 investigation Friday.",
      "\u201cWe discovered that our office was presented with a sexual assault allegation against Mr. Robinson in 2015 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said in a statement Friday.",
      "\u201cIn that matter, a declination of charges was made based on insufficient evidence,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said. \u201cWe are not able to provide further information at this time because of an ongoing law enforcement investigation.\u201d",
      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed that it conducted an investigation and that no charges were ever filed.",
      "\"Due to the confidential nature of the investigation, we cannot provide more information,\" th sheriff's department said in a statement Friday.",
      "Earlier this month, Robinson was sued by four former housekeepers who have accused the \"You\u2019ve Really Got a Hold on Me\" singer of sexual assault. The suit, which seeks at least $50 million, also names Robinson's wife and accused her of knowing about the allegations.",
      "Robinson has denied the claims, and this week countersued the four women and their attorneys, alleging defamation and seeking at least $500 million.",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost, who is representing Robinson and his wife, said his client maintains his innocence.",
      "\"One unfortunate aspect of celebrity is that it is not uncommon to be the target of spurious and unsubstantiated allegations,\" Frost said. \"Mr. Robinson looks forward to the conclusion of the current investigation, and has no doubt that a similar determination will be reached here.\"",
      "Attorneys for the women suing Robinson said Friday that the declination of the criminal case in 2015 only means there was a lack of evidence.",
      "The person who made the allegation in 2015 is not any of the four women who are suing Robinson, according to the attorneys, John Harris and Herbert Hayden.",
      "\"The statement released by the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirms that charges were not filed against Mr. Robinson due to insufficient evidence \u2014 not because the claims lacked merit,\" Harris and Hayden said.",
      "\"This underscores the significant challenges victims face when reporting incidents of sexual assault, particularly when the alleged perpetrator is a powerful and well-known figure,\" they said.",
      "On May 15, NBC News reported that Robinson is under criminal investigation, citing a law enforcement source that it did not name.",
      "Robinson is an iconic American soul singer who has had a star-studded career spanning more than 70 years.",
      "The recording, producing and songwriting legend was a pioneer for Motown Records, founding the vocal group the Miracles in the 1950s and later releasing albums as a solo artist and working as a record executive for the label. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",

    "summary": "Major automakers are set to resurrect a type of hybrid vehicle that seemed dead in the U.S. just a few years ago to meet a changing consumer demand landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Major automakers are set to resurrect a type of hybrid vehicle that seemed dead in the U.S. just a few years ago to meet a changing consumer demand landscape. Extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) are a form of plug-in hybrid that falls midway between traditional hybrids and full EVs. EREV cars and trucks rely on battery powered motors for propulsion (like an EV) but also have a relatively small gas engine to use as a generator to keep the batteries charged up (like a typical hybrid). A key difference between EREVs and other hybrids is the relative size of their batteries and gas engines.",
      "Mainstream hybrids and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) like the Toyota Prius still rely on combustion engines as their main means of propulsion. Thus, they have proportionately smaller batteries, but substantial gas engines that are directly connected to their drivetrains to help move the car. EREVs are much more focused on the electric side of the equation, so they tend to have bigger batteries than other hybrids, but comparatively small gas engines that solely function as generators to top off the batteries when needed.Earlier examples of this type of vehicle \u2014 the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma \u2014 were introduced to the U.S market in 2011. These were followed by the BMW i3 and Cadillac ELR in 2014. But EREVs (also known as Range Extended Electric Vehicles, or REEVs), never attracted much interest from American consumers. The Volt was the most popular EREV by far, with GM selling 157,000 over nine years, until it ended production in 2019. That may seem impressive, but it\u2019s a blip in the overall U.S. new vehicle market, which saw about 16 million sales each year in that timeframe.",
      "The last EREV sold domestically was the i3, which BMW discontinued in 2022. While there are no new EREVs for sale in the U.S., several are in the pipeline.",
      "This includes an upcoming version of the Ram 1500 pickup truck, set to come to market in early 2026. A Ram spokesman noted that it will have the longest driving range the company has ever offered in a light-duty truck, up to 690 total miles between its gas engine and battery power. An EREV version of the Jeep Grand Wagoneer is also under development, according to the company. Volkswagen is planning to begin production of an EREV pickup truck and SUV under the Scout brand name starting in 2027.",
      "Hyundai Motors plans to introduce EREV versions of its mid-sized SUVs by the end of 2026, according to a spokesman. The vehicles are expected to have more than 560 miles of range, and be sold under the Hyundai and Genesis brands. In addition, a Nissan spokesman confirmed that the company is considering offering EREV options in its mid-size and larger SUVs. \u201cThey do offer advantages versus 100% EVs when it comes to hauling and towing,\u201d he said, \u201callowing greater driving range without the need for a large capacity battery, as well as faster refueling.\u201d",
      "James Martin, the director of consulting services at S&P Global Mobility, says one reason manufacturers are turning to EREVs is lower production costs. EREV use of smaller and less expensive batteries than full EVs allows manufacturers to keep their expenses down. EREVs are also less complex than plug-in hybrids, Martin said. PHEVs have two functioning propulsion systems and sophisticated controls to allow them to communicate with each other. Most EREVs, by contrast, are solely propelled by their electric motors.",
      "Range anxiety, and cost, still big factors in EV adoption",
      "But one of the biggest advantages of EREVs is range. In China, where EREVs are gaining in popularity, the manufacturer BYD offers mid-sized sedans with more than 1,300 miles of claimed range. EREVs also alleviate range anxiety due to the ubiquity of gas stations. Consumers can just fill up with gasoline to charge the battery if a charging port is unavailable. The new EREVs can travel more than 100 miles on batteries alone, then hundreds more using gasoline.",
      "\u201cRange anxiety is still a factor when it comes to choosing an electric vehicle over an internal combustion vehicle,\u201d said K. Venkatesh Prasad, senior vice president of research and chief innovation officer at the Center for Automotive Research. \u201cEREVs, allay the range anxiety concern,\u201d he said.",
      "These hybrids may especially appeal to consumers who frequently travel long distances, and getting more consumers used to plugging in their vehicles might also appeal to manufacturers. \u201cThe actual charging experience of EREVs is very similar to that of BEVs,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cSo, the market adoption of EREVs is likely to be seen as a good ramp to future BEV purchase considerations,\u201d he added.",
      "Charging infrastructure is still lagging in many areas of the U.S., according to iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer, which can make a full EV impractical for consumers. EREVs avoid that issue and may also be attractive to consumers who live in apartments or houses that lack charging stations.",
      "A recent report from McKinsey noted that EREVs could also combat cost concerns among consumers, noting that the smaller batteries can shave off as much as $6,000 in powertrain production costs, compared to BEVs. Another factor, according to McKinsey, is that both domestic and European manufacturers have seen how EREVs have gained sales momentum in China, a sign the technology may help to increase electrification adoption in their own marketplaces.",
      "\u201cWe expect all levels of hybridization to increase production in North America throughout the decade,\u201d said Eric Anderson, the associate director of Americas light vehicle powertrain forecasting for S&P Global Mobility. Hybrids, including EREVs, are a \u201crelatively affordable way for consumers to move up the electrification ladder without a significant monthly payment increase, he said.",
      "While the EV vehicle market continued to grow last year, the pace of growth has slowed considerably. \u201cThe BEV market is in the process of shifting from early adopters to a more price-conscious buyer,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "Domestic sales of hybrids grew from 1,175,456 in 2023 to 1,609,035 in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, a 37% increase. Plug-in hybrids grew 10% in the same period \u2014 from 293,578 to 321,774. By comparison, fully electric EVs saw 7% growth, from 1,164,638 to 1,247,656. While overall sales of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles continues to dominate, its market share has fallen every year since 2015, according to Edmunds. Last year, ICE vehicle sales fell to 80.8% of total U.S. sales, down from 84% in 2023.",
      "Another attribute that might make EREVs popular with consumers is resale value. Hybrids \u2014 which includes EREVs and more common plug-in hybrids \u2014 depreciate less than EVs or traditional gas vehicles. Since depreciation is the most expensive part of car ownership, finding a vehicle that better retains its value can provide consumers with significant savings. By contrast, electric cars and trucks lose value faster than any other vehicle type \u2014 dropping by 58.8% after five years, compared to the overall vehicle depreciation average of 45.6% and only 40.7% for hybrids, according to research from iSeeCars.",
      "\u201cElectric vehicle sales have been slowing on both the new and used market, with EVs sitting on dealer lots longer despite falling prices,\u201d Brauer said. \u201cConsumers are showing increasing appreciation for hybrid vehicles, creating a friendly environment for automakers to introduce more plug-in hybrids as an intermediate step toward full electric vehicles.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump told U.S. steelworkers on Friday that he will double tariffs on steel imports to 50%.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring it from 25% to 50%, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America,\u201d Trump said during remarks at U.S. Steel\u2019s Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.",
      "Trump is visiting U.S. Steel after indicating last week that he will clear a controversial merger with Japan\u2019s Nippon. Investors and union members are listening for answers from the president on what shape the deal he announced between U.S. Steel and Nippon will take.",
      "Trump described the deal as a \u201cpartnership\u201d in a May 23 post on his social media platform Truth Social. The president said U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and Nippon would invest $14 billion over 14 months in the more than 120-year-old American industrial icon.",
      "Trump told reporters on Sunday that the deal is an \u201cinvestment, it\u2019s a partial ownership, but it will be controlled by the USA.\u201d But the White House and the companies have provided little detail to the public on how the deal is structured since Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "U.S. Steel has described the deal as a \u201cmerger\u201d in which it will become a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary\u201d of Nippon Steel North America but continue to operate as separate company, according to an April 8 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Sources familiar with the matter told CNBC\u2019s David Faber that Nippon is expected to close its acquisition of U.S. Steel at $55 per share, the original offer the Japanese steelmaker made before President Joe Biden rejected the deal in January. Biden blocked Nippon\u2019s proposed acquisition on national security grounds, arguing that it would jeopardize critical supply chains.",
      "But Trump ordered a new review of the deal in April, softening his previous opposition to Nippon buying U.S. Steel. The president announced the \u201cpartnership\u201d one day after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was supposed to conclude its review and make a recommendation on whether the companies had found ways to \u201cmitigate any national security risks.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick told CNBC on Tuesday that the U.S. government will have a \u201cgolden share\u201d that will allow it to decide on a number of board seats. U.S. Steel will have an American CEO and a majority of the board will come from the U.S. McCormick said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\u201d McCormick told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019ll be a golden share that will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren\u2019t cut.\u201d",
      "The \u201cgolden share\u201d likely wouldn\u2019t take the form of an equity stake by the U.S. government, said James Brower, a partner at law firm Morrison Forrester\u2019s litigation department. The committee that reviewed the deal, CFIUS, does not negotiate equity interests, Brower said.",
      "It would likely take the form of contractual right for the U.S. government to veto certain actions, said Brower, who has represented clients on issues related to CFIUS.",
      "Nippon will \u201chave certainly members of the board and this will be part of their overall corporate structure,\u201d McCormick told CNBC. White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday that \u201cNippon Steel is going to have some involvement, but no control of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cU.S. Steel owns the company,\u201d Navarro said. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Friday that the details of the Nippon Steel deal \u201cremain confidential, relatively.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe underlying principle is that the United States should have control over key critical sectors, whether it\u2019s basic manufacturing or high tech,\u201d Greer told \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cIn the event that foreign countries or foreign individuals or firms want to acquire these companies or have large investments, the U.S. has to maintain control of things that matter.\u201d",
      "The United Steelworkers, which originally opposed the deal, has said the union \u201ccannot speculate about the impact\u201d of Trump\u2019s announcement \u201cwithout more information.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur concern remains that Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs,\u201d USW President David McCall said in a statement."

      "Mia, facing a forceful cross-examination, struck a respectful but defiant tone.

      "This is all fair game for cross-examination. In fact, it\u2019s essential. So far, a few of the government\u2019s witnesses have described what a horrible person Diddy was \u2014 but then testified that they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to walk away from him.",
      "The government called an expert to testify that victims of domestic violence find it difficult to extricate themselves from a romantic partner. But is that the same for employees who work for a tyrant? Are they also unable to leave? Maybe.",
      "Perhaps members of the jury identify with Mia \u2014 perhaps they also once had a horrible boss but felt they couldn\u2019t leave their job. Or maybe they see Mia as less credible because, in their minds, no matter how bad the job is, you can always choose to leave. And it seems no one wanted to leave Diddy, no matter how despicably he behaved.",

      "Local regulators should immediately stop Elon Musk\u2019s supercomputer project from operating in South Memphis because it's out of compliance with environmental rules, the NAACP wrote in a letter sent Thursday to Shelby County officials.",
      "The civil rights group addressed the request to Dr. Michelle Taylor, director of the Shelby County Health Department, and to the commissioners of Memphis Light Gas and Water. The health department is responsible for implementing federal air regulations in Shelby County, which encompasses Memphis.",
      "\u201cBeing the world\u2019s richest man doesn\u2019t give you the right to pollute Black communities and jeopardize the health of its residents,\u201d NAACP president and CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cWe urge the health department to step in immediately.\u201d",
      "When contacted, a spokesperson for Memphis Light Gas and Water said it had not received the NAACP letter and could not comment on it. Neither the health department nor xAI immediately responded to questions about the letter, which was also signed by the presidents of the Tennessee and Memphis chapters of the NAACP.",
      "In a previous statement to NBC News, xAI said its \"operations comply with all applicable laws\u201d and that it \u201cworks collaboratively with County and City officials, EPA personnel, and community leaders regarding all things that affect Memphis.\u201d",
      "xAI has come under scrutiny in recent months for operating methane gas turbines at its Memphis facility to meet the electricity needs of the supercomputer Colossus. The turbines emit pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde, according to their manufacturer.",
      "Environmental groups and the NAACP believe the turbines required permits under the Clean Air Act; the city\u2019s health department, the mayor and the Chamber of Commerce have said permits were not required for the turbines\u2019 first year of use. xAI, which is now seeking a permit for 15 permanent turbines, said those would be equipped with pollution controls and only be used as backup once other energy options are available.",
      "Earlier this month, NBC News reported on a South Memphis neighborhood called Boxtown, about two miles from xAI\u2019s facility, where residents are concerned that Musk\u2019s project will harm the area\u2019s already poor air quality.",
      "\u201cThey got money. And they can do what they want to do, you know, without consulting us,\u201d said Easter Knox, who has lived in the area since 1977. Knox told NBC News she and her husband both struggle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be exacerbated by pollution.",
      "Health department officials have been limited in their comments about the project. On Friday, news broke that Taylor, the department head, would be leaving Shelby County to oversee the Baltimore City Health Department.",
      "Colossus, which xAI calls the world\u2019s largest supercomputer, came online in September 2024 to train Grok, the company\u2019s chatbot. But critics say the project\u2019s potential economic benefit to the community is outweighed by environmental concerns.",
      "\u201cWhile we applaud research and innovation,\u201d the NAACP letter states, \u201cthere must be limits that ensure that communities are healthy and alive to enjoy the benefits of any potential innovation.\u201d",
      "Shelby County health officials are expected to make a decision on xAI\u2019s application in the coming weeks.",

      "A third person was arrested in the death of a Super Bowl reporter in New Orleans, providing fresh evidence of what authorities described Friday as an organized plot to drug and rob people.",
      "Police in Kenner, just west of New Orleans, accused Christian Anderson of renting the car used by Danette Colbert, one of two suspects previously charged with second-degree murder, fraud and theft crimes in the Feb. 5 death of Adan Manzano, 27.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill has described Colbert, 48, as a \"serial fraudster.\"",
      "In a news release, the Kenner Police Department said that Anderson, 33, allegedly provided logistical support and spoke extensively with Colbert after Manzano was found dead in a Kenner hotel. The department also accused Anderson of seeking to benefit from Manzano\u2019s stolen assets.",
      "Investigators reviewed text messages and digital communications showing that Anderson allegedly \u201cplayed an active role in a coordinated pattern of targeting victims, drugging them, and stealing personal property, including phones and financial account access,\u201d the department said.",
      "Anderson was arrested on suspicion of simple robbery, purse snatching, access device fraud, illegal transmission of money, bank fraud and computer fraud, the department said.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he has a lawyer to speak on his behalf.",
      "Manzano, a Telemundo reporter, was in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl. He was last seen entering his hotel room with Colbert on the morning of Feb. 5, Kenner police officials have said.",
      "Authorities have partly blamed Manzano\u2019s death on the combined toxic effects of alprazolam, an anti-anxiety drug often sold under the brand name Xanax, and ethanol. It isn't clear how the drug, which Manzano did not have a prescription for, got into his system.",
      "A device believed to be Manzano\u2019s cellphone was found at Colbert\u2019s home, police officials have said, and she allegedly used his credit card at a New Orleans-area store.",
      "The third alleged accomplice, Rickey White, 34, was arrested in Florida in March on fraud and theft charges. He was extradited to Louisiana and charged with second-degree murder earlier this month.",
      "An attorney for White has denied the charges. Lawyers for Colbert have not responded to requests for comment but have said in court that she should not be judged on her criminal history.",
      "Colbert has previously been charged in several other similar fraud cases, some of which included allegations of drugging. In one case, the victim accused her of drugging him, leaving him for dead and stealing tens of thousands of dollars through accounts linked to his iPhone.",
      "Colbert was convicted of computer fraud and other charges in October. Despite pleas from the victim, David Butler, that Colbert be given the maximum penalty for what he described in an impact statement as her \u201ccontinued disregard for others,\u201d she was sentenced to five years of probation in December, two months before Manzano\u2019s death.",
      "After NBC News reported on Butler\u2019s case, the Louisiana Attorney General Office intervened and sought a tougher penalty for Colbert. Earlier this month, the judge who imposed probation found Colbert to be a \u201chabitual offender\u201d and sentenced her to 25 years in prison, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.",
      "\u201cDanette Colbert will finally be held accountable, and she will no longer be free to continue preying on innocent people,\u201d Butler said afterward. \u201cI sincerely hope this decision brings some peace to other survivors and helps restore their faith in the justice system.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Colbert did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Meanwhile, Kristen Welker digs into Trump\u2019s latest social media salvos at Vladimir Putin and what they could mean for the Russia-Ukraine war. And senior Supreme Court reporter Lawrence Hurley answers a reader question about a notable provision tucked into the House budget bill that passed recently.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Scott Bland",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s missed opportunity",
      "Elon Musk stood next to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, but the physical proximity belied a growing philosophical divide between two of the world\u2019s most powerful men, resulting in the tech mogul\u2019s abrupt announcement that he is departing Washington \u2014 without having achieved his goal of decimating the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe came, he saw, he folded,\u201d Steve Bannon, a senior White House adviser during Trump\u2019s first term who is influential with the working-class wing of Trump\u2019s MAGA base, said in a text exchange with NBC News.",
      "Musk, who stood with his arms folded across his chest as he and Trump took questions, sported a bruise near his right eye \u2014 an unmistakable metaphor for his tumultuous government service \u2014 that he said was incurred while playing with his 5-year-old son X.",
      "Trump took a more charitable view of Musk\u2019s tenure during a sprawling news conference in which he also declined to rule out pardoning Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is standing trial on charges of sex trafficking and other alleged crimes; said he dislikes \u201cthe concept\u201d of former first lady Jill Biden being forced to testify before Congress about her husband\u2019s mental fitness; and predicted again that Iran is on the cusp of making a deal that would suspend its pursuit of nuclear weapons.",
      "\u201cHe had to go through the slings and the arrows, which is a shame because he\u2019s an incredible patriot,\u201d Trump said of Musk.",
      "Trump and Musk both contended that DOGE will continue to wring out savings by rooting out waste and fraud without Musk as its face.",
      "\u201cThis is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning,\u201d Musk said, vowing to reach the trillion-dollar mark in cuts by the middle of next year. At the same time he spoke of cutting government spending, Musk lauded Trump\u2019s remodeling of the Oval Office.",
      "\u201cI love the gold on the ceiling,\u201d he said.",
      "Musk has argued that inertia throttled his efforts to reduce government spending \u2014 a conclusion that raises questions about whether he was naive about the challenge of the mission he undertook.",
      "\u201cThe federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,\u201d he told The Washington Post this week. \u201cI thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.\u201d",
      "Read more \u2192",
      "The next steps as Trump vents fury at Putin",
      "President Donald Trump has ramped up the rhetoric attacking Russian President Vladimir Putin, but so far there\u2019s no teeth behind it.",
      "After months of cutting Putin slack on the world stage and clashing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump has undergone a stark rhetorical shift in recent days.",
      "He\u2019s taken to social media to blast Putin for having gone \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d and for \u201cneedlessly killing a lot of people\u201d including Ukrainian citizens \u201cfor no reason whatsoever.\u201d He has warned that \u201cwhat Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t realize is that if it weren\u2019t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He\u2019s playing with fire!\u201d",
      "Trump appears to now be warming to the belief many Western leaders have held for years \u2014 that Putin isn\u2019t seriously pushing for peace, outside of total Russian victory. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen some of the biggest bombardments of the entire war, including a massive drone attack in Kyiv that came in the shadow of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "None of this means Trump is buddy-buddy with Zelenskyy now, and he criticized the Ukrainian as \u201cstubborn\u201d during Friday remarks in the Oval Office, even as he underscored his disappointment with Putin.",
      "Meanwhile, the issue of sanctioning Russia and sending aid to Ukraine obviously splits the GOP, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily sit well with the \u201cAmerica First\u201d wing of the GOP that Trump commands. But if Trump wants to act, as former Vice President Mike Pence told me he recommended during our conversation earlier this month, he has arrows in his quiver.",
      "Earlier this week on \u201cMeet the Press Now,\u201d former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told us that the only way to convince Putin to come to the negotiating table is to convince him he can\u2019t advance on the battlefield. While one might think the West is tapped out when it comes to sanctions, McFaul said there\u2019s a lot more on the table, including seizing more assets or banning Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d that ships oil from docking at Western ports.",
      "And just a few days ago, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, an elder statesman in the Senate, called on Trump to be as \u201cdecisive\u201d in new sanctions against Russia as he\u2019s been in his push against Harvard University.",
      "So if Putin has run out of leash with Trump, then what\u2019s the president waiting for?",
      "Join us Sunday when we talk about this and a flurry of other important domestic and international issues with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.",
      "\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: Congress and the courts",
      "Thanks to everyone who emailed us! This week\u2019s reader question is on an under-the-radar provision in Republicans\u2019 \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cI heard that the bill contains language that takes away a judge\u2019s authority to hold someone in contempt when they don\u2019t comply with the court\u2019s orders. Is that true? I\u2019ve seen a lot about the financial implications but nothing on this.\u201d",
      "To answer this, we turned to senior Supreme Court reporter Lawrence Hurley. Here\u2019s his response:",
      "The House bill does indeed include a provision that would limit the ability of federal judges to hold people in contempt for violating court orders. (Read it here.)",
      "The Republican-backed measure comes amid considerable pushback on the right against a number of judges who have not only blocked Trump administration policies but have also questioned whether the administration is complying with rulings and at least considered contempt proceedings.",
      "The provision in question would seek to limit the ability of judges to pursue contempt findings by withholding federal funds that could be used to enforce such a ruling unless the plaintiff posted a bond when seeking a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.",
      "But there is no guarantee the Senate will include the language in its version of the bill, in part because it may fall foul of rules intended to ensure budget bill provisions have a direct link to federal revenues.",

      "President Donald Trump has not ruled out pardoning or commuting the sentence of former Sen. Bob Menendez, though allies believe there is only a small chance that the New Jersey Democrat will receive clemency before he\u2019s scheduled to report to prison next month, according to a White House official and three additional people familiar with the discussions.",
      "Menendez allies have made multiple overtures to the White House since Trump took office to request either a pardon or a commutation of his 11-year prison sentence following his conviction on bribery and corruption charges, according to four people familiar with the efforts.",
      "After one such overture, some of Menendez\u2019s allies were convinced Trump will not grant the New Jersey Democrat clemency, people familiar with the efforts said. But a White House official says Trump has not made a decision on the matter.",
      "Earlier this year, Menendez appealed to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a former Senate colleague and a Trump ally, to request a pardon or sentence commutation on his behalf, according to three people with direct knowledge of that effort. Graham and Menendez have long had a close relationship, with Graham standing by the Democrat during Menendez's first indictment a decade ago on federal corruption charges. But Graham has declined to get involved.",
      "Menendez has also tried to use his longtime connections to Jewish leaders in New York and New Jersey as a different avenue to get to Trump, according to two people familiar with those discussions. Menendez was a fierce advocate for Israel during his time in office and has attempted to leverage his ties to prominent Jewish groups and key stakeholders, as NBC News previously reported.",
      "Menendez had also reached out to the family of Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner for help securing a pardon, but he was rebuffed, according to one source familiar with the attempt.",
      "Menendez sought and failed to obtain clemency from President Joe Biden before he left office earlier this year.",
      "Menendez pleaded not guilty on federal bribery and corruption charges but was convicted in July and resigned from the Senate in August. Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was convicted on similar charges in a separate trial.",
      "In attempt to appeal to Trump, Menendez has argued that he was politically targeted by the Justice Department. In a Friday post on X, Menendez accused Democrats of \u201cweaponizing the Justice Dept.\u201d against him when he was first indicted in 2015. The Justice Department ultimately dropped that case in 2018.",
      "\u201cWhen, as the Chairman of the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee], I didn\u2019t go along with Obama\u2019s Iran deal, I was indicted, and the next day after being stripped of my position, Obama announced the Iran deal,\u201d Menendez wrote.",
      "Despite his appeals to Trump, Menendez does not have a close relationship with the president and has been an adversary at key moments. Menendez joined all Senate Democrats in voting to convict Trump during his two impeachment trials, for instance \u2014 an act a person close to Trump previously told NBC News would weigh against him."

Kardashian later published a video clip that seemingly showed Swift approving the name drop. The singer was branded a \u201csnake\u201d and hashtags like \u201c#KimExposedTaylorParty\u201d went viral.",

      "\"If the system\u2019s going to hand out presidential favors like party invites, maybe it should start with someone who actually brought people joy, not someone who stole millions and used their fame to dodge accountability,\" one user wrote.",
      "\"I respect the love you have for your family, but love doesn\u2019t erase facts,\" one user commented. \"Your parents weren\u2019t wrongfully imprisoned, they were convicted by a jury of falsifying documents, defrauding banks of over $30 million, evading taxes, obstructing justice, and lying to the government while living a lavish lifestyle on TV. That\u2019s not a political vendetta, it\u2019s financial crime. Real families have lost homes, savings, and stability because people like your parents game the system.\"",
      "Still, Chase Chrisley maintains that the pardons have brought about a satisfactory conclusion for his family.",
      "\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, our family\u2019s name has been cleared with a presidential pardon,\u201d Chase Chrisley said to Entertainment Tonight, before including a response to those who feel critical of the pardon.",

      "For nearly 30 years, 98 Degrees have been creating romantic pop and R&B ballads that have stood the test of time.",
      "Whether it was their 1997 debut single, \u201cInvisible Man,\u201d their first major hit, \u201cBecause of You,\u201d or their sultry Spanglish single, \u201cGive Me Just One Night (Una Noche),\u201d Jeff Timmons, Justin Jeffre and brothers Drew and Nick Lachey have stayed true to their boy band\u2019s DNA.",
      "The singers are back with new music and rerecordings of their classics with \u201cFull Circle,\u201d their first non-Christmas album in 12 years. The 11-track record includes five new songs and six rerecordings, including \u201cI Do (Cherish You)\u201d and \u201cThe Hardest Thing.\u201d",
      "The group tells TODAY.com about the importance of reclaiming their catalog and their career by taking ownership of their work, as well at the meticulous process of finding the exact sounds they used in the originals.",
      "When taking a fresh yet faithful approach to their hits, 98 Degrees had one thing in mind: maintaining the original essence of the song.",
      "\u201cWhen you rerecord known songs that we\u2019ve had over the years, I think there\u2019s two approaches, right? You can go for a completely different interpretation of that song, or try and keep it as close to the original as you can \u2014 and that was our goal,\u201d Nick Lachey tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was to keep it as close to the original.\u201d",
      "However, during the remaking process, they experienced some challenges, including the advancement of technology and their vocals.",
      "\u201cIt was a little harder to rerecord the hits than we thought it would be and to find the right sounds,\u201d Jeffre says, before further explaining the process. \u201cFor instance, some of the sounds, they\u2019re hard to find or to identify (because of the advancement in technology).\u201d",
      "Timmons adds that some of the tools they used back in the day have been re-created in digital versions, \u201cbut they sound a little bit different.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe worked with some really talented young producers that really scoured the internet trying to find those exact sounds,\u201d Timmons says.",
      "The singers also had to factor in the change in their voices from when they were young adults to now. Nick Lachey says his voice is \u201ctotally different\u201d now than it was back in the \u201890s, when he first recorded \u201cInvisible Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou change the way you sing it, the lines, the melody, you\u2019ve changed those in concerts over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s tricky to go back and actually match, or try and match, what happened 20-some years ago. I think it was actually easier to record the originals than it was to rerecord for that reason.\u201d",
      "The group credits Taylor Swift and Prince as inspiration for the rerecording process and ownership of their music. Swift has famously been rerecording her music after Scooter Braun purchased her former record label, Big Machine Records, in 2019 and became the owner of the master recordings of her first six albums. To reclaim her music catalog, she rerecorded her albums as \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d and included never-released tracks.",
      "Prince also had a careerlong battle with record labels to own his own music and release what and when he wanted.",
      "\u201c(Swift) took control of those masters and the ownership of those. So for us, it was the same situation where we want to take ownership of the songs, but we still want those songs to be accessed for different projects,\u201d Drew Lachey says. \u201cPeople might want the original, but now they have the \u201898 Degrees' Version,\u2019 which we have control of. We can say where it\u2019s used, where it\u2019s not used.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey adds, \u201cThese songs defined our career, they\u2019re a part of us, and to have the feeling you can\u2019t control your own identity just seems ridiculous. So we jumped at the chance to do this.\u201d",
      "Their goal isn\u2019t to \u201cre-create the wheel\u201d with the \u201c98 Degrees' Version.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s the ability to say \u201cwe own our own music,\u201d Timmons says. \u201cAnd we hope that it inspires other artists to go out there and do the same.\u201d",
      "The group adds that they can change the way they perform the songs and can \u201cflip it a little bit onstage to keep it fresh.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the fans fell in love with the song sounding a certain way,\u201d Timmons points out. \u201cSo we wanted to keep the integrity intact of those songs the way they were.\u201d"

    "summary": "\"The Pitt\" puts a spotlight on the importance of Filipino nurses in the health care system through Princess and Perlah. Actors Amielynn Abellera and  Kristin Villanueva call it an honor.",
    "story": [
      "HBO Max's \"The Pitt\" opens on a sleepy Steel City as Dr. Robby Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) makes his way to work at a Pittsburgh emergency room. He's met with a waiting room overflowing with patients and only makes it a couple of feet onto the ER floor before two people bombard him with questions.",
      "\"Is it true? Simi told Hector that Dr. Deranjian said the hospital was up for sale,\" nurse Perlah, played by Amielynn Abellera, says, marking the series' first line of dialogue.",
      "\"They might turn it into an ortho center, with no ER,\" Kristin Villanueva's character, Princess, chimes in.",
      "Robby diplomatically denies the rumors, but Princess and Perlah don't buy it. Still flanking the senior attending physician, Princess asks Perlah in Tagalog, \"Do you believe him?\"",
      "\"I never trust the doctors,\" she responds.",
      "The exchange \u2014\u00a0featuring one of the primary languages spoken in the Philippines \u2014\u00a0takes place less than three minutes into the show, establishing Princess and Perlah as two of the emergency room's most beloved figures. Throughout \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d Abellera and Villanueva\u2019s characters, who make appearances in every episode, provide both comedic relief and constant life-saving assistance to keep the place running.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an honor. I\u2019m so excited and to be a part of \u2018The Pitt\u2019 where there\u2019s three of us \u2014 there\u2019s three (Filipino women) in the whole main ensemble of the storytelling,\u201d Abellera tells TODAY.com, referring to herself, Villanueva and Isa Briones, who plays Dr. Trinity Santos. \u201cI\u2019m still pinching myself that that\u2019s even happening \u2014 that specifically Filipino stories are being told through these three characters.\u201d",
      "Filipino nurses are a critical part of the nursing workforce in the U.S. While Abellera was raised by a nurse and doctor, she says she didn\u2019t know how much of an impact Filipino nurses had on the American health care system until she was an adult, citing a lack of representation in Hollywood.",
      "\"In a way, that makes me really melancholic of how I didn't have that growing up,\" she says. \"But cut to today, there just seems to be this sort of cultural tectonic shift of Filipino and Filipino American stories and experiences being able to make their way into these mainstream media spaces.\"",
      "In the U.S., 4% of the nursing workforce is made up of Filipinos, despite the demographic only making up 1% of the total U.S. population, according to a 2024 article written for the National Institutes of Health's official newsletter. The prevalence of nurses who are Filipino in the U.S. stems from colonization of the Philippines, per the NIH. Starting in the 1900s, Filipinos could immigrate to the U.S. through their work as nurses, and \"they embedded themselves as an integral part of the American healthcare system,\" the NIH article states.",
      "But despite the prevalence of Filipino nurses in the workforce, in the medical subgenre of TV dramas, they haven't always been represented until recently. \"Grey's Anatomy\" featured a Filipino nurse in the Season 17 finale. The 2024 ER-set mockumentary \"St. Denis Medical\" spotlighted the cool nurses on the floor \u2014\u00a0a \"clique\" of Filipino nurses \u2014\u00a0in its fourth episode, titled, \"Salamat You Too.\" (Salamat means \"thank you\" in Tagalog.)",
      "And then there's \"The Pitt,\" which Abellera and Villanueva say celebrates the importance of a community that has long been overlooked in Hollywood.",
      "A spotlight on Tagalog",
      "In \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d Princess and Perlah often converse in Tagalog \u2014 occasionally to discuss the other doctors. There's even one scene in Episode 11 where Dr. Santos (Isa Briones) overhears Princess and Perlah's conversation and chimes in in Tagalog, surprising Princess and Perlah.",
      "\"I told you she was Filipina,\" Perlah whispers to Princess after.",
      "Villanueva says she's \"usually the Isa\" in that kind of situation. She calls filming the scene \"so fun,\" adding that they improvised several takes.",
      "\"It's very gratifying,\" she says. \"And for it to happen towards the later part of the season, it's just brilliant.\"",
      "Abellera says she isn\u2019t a native speaker of Tagalog, but when the show began, she was about five years into lessons in an effort to \u201cembrace this side\u201d of her culture.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of our language, we\u2019re so proud to meet other Filipinos in our workspaces and out in the community,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, for that to be just a part of the storytelling is just an incredible thing.\u201d",
      "Abellera adds that some of Perlah's habits and mannerisms \u2014 from the way she charts to the Post-it notes littering her workspace \u2014 were inspired by watching her parents at work. Abellera\u2019s dad is a doctor, while her mom is a nurse.",
      "\u201cI always got to see my dad interact with patients and with nurses, and then I also got to see my mom interact with her nurse friends and speak Tagalog with them,\u201d she says. \u201cHow it\u2019s just a joyous experience for them to be able to bond over their Tagalog and also bringing food and being able to celebrate their culture in that way.\u201d",
      "More than background characters",
      "In a show that's so serious Abellera won't let her daughter watch it, Princess and Perlah often lighten the mood, from commenting on doctor's love lives to theorizing why two people might be fighting. But Villanueva wants to make it clear that their characters are much more than just a duo gossiping in the background.",
      "Villanueva says she previously told her agent that she wanted to limit the amount of nursing roles she auditioned for as she found the characters were often there in the background to \u201ccheck a box.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to perpetuate that kind of lack of focus on nurses\u2019 personality,\u201d Villanueva says. \u201cThey have points of view, they have humor, they have feelings. So, I just could feel that there\u2019s a lot more progress that we can do.\u201d",
      "But she says from the moment she got \u201cThe Pitt\u201d casting call, she knew Princess was more than a background character.",
      "The name tipped her off first.",
      "\u201cI saw Princess\u2019 name, like somebody did a lot of research. ... You wouldn\u2019t blink twice if you meet a Filipino that\u2019s named Princess, but to the whole world, it\u2019s kind of like, \u2018Huh, that\u2019s an odd, special name,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Villanueva also recalls reviewing a complex description accompanying the character, giving Princess a decided amount of depth.",
      "Princess isn't just a \u201cyes, doctor\u201d figure, Villanueva says. Instead, she was described as a \u201cforce not to messed with.\u201d Other details included that she speaks six languages and has a personality both \u201canimated and spunky\u201d and \u201cwhip smart with a dose of sarcasm.\u201d",
      "Villanueva admits that it was \u201ca little bit scary at first,\u201d knowing that strides toward representation come with a pressure to get it right. But she calls the chance to add to that representation in Hollywood an \u201cabsolute honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting to play a real-life superhero in scrubs,\u201d she says.",
      "Perlah and Princess are also established leaders in the ER. After charge nurse Dana (Katherine LaNasa) is punched by an unsatisfied patient, Perlah steps in to run the floor, after Princess volunteers on her behalf.",
      "\u201cI think all of us are ready to go whenever Dana needs assistance,\u201d Abellera says.",
      "Much of the inspiration for Abellera's portrayal of Perlah came from her mom, but she adds she had to do a lot of research to understand the character. Abellera grew up Catholic, while Perlah is Muslim.",
      "Perlah is written as a practicing, hijab-wearing Muslim woman, but she isn\u2019t defined by her religion, Abellera says.",
      "\u201cI think that is so important that that\u2019s just her and there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not emphasized in a way that we have to think about it, and it\u2019s not written into any dramatic or funny character storyline. And I think that\u2019s what I love about all the characters and the specific nature of what they represent in the world, because that is exactly what the world is.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all have different backgrounds, we all have different faiths, we all have different things that are visible or not visible,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t have to change anything \u2014 like we don\u2019t have to pay attention to it. And I think that\u2019s something that I find the Filipino American Muslim community has really reached out and told me about is that it\u2019s a big deal that it\u2019s not a big deal. You\u2019re just you and you\u2019re just Muslim.\u201d",
      "Fan-favorite status",
      "Villanueva says she\u2019s \u201cvery happy that a lot of Filipino nurses feel very, very seen\u201d by her and Abellera\u2019s characters.",
      "Audiences have also taken note of Princess and Perlah, with viewers on social media swiftly giving them fan-favorite treatment and praising their depiction.",
      "\"princess and perlah remind me of my auntie emmy,\" one X user wrote in part, accompanied by a heart emoji-filled meme and the text, \"i love you.\"",
      "\"They kill me! That\u2019s what makes The Pitt so realistic,\" one Redditor wrote about the duo. \"Filipinas make up a sizeable portion of hospital care but you rarely see them in TV hospital dramas.\"",
      "Another Reddit user pointed out that during a particularly tense scene, when a gun is found strapped to a patient's leg, everyone ducks \u2014 except Perlah, who throws herself over the patient on the gurney in front of her.",
      "\"Not all heroes wear capes, some rock scrubs and a hijab,\" the commenter wrote.",
      "Abellera says that moment wasn't scripted.",
      "\"I just remember hearing the word gun, and I heard the patient actress breathe \u2014 and it was almost this strange, fear, scared whimper \u2014 and I just instinctually jumped on her,\" Abellera says. \"It was not written in the script at all, but I, for whatever reason, I felt the need to protect this person, and as a nurse, that\u2019s all I wanted to do, because she was terrified.\"",
      "She jokes that when she first dove across the patient, it shocked everyone, even herself. But then the room burst into applause, and the director decided to keep it in.",
      "What's next for Princess and Perlah?",
      "As \u201cThe Pitt\u201d only documented one shift in Princess and Perlah\u2019s life, both Abellera and Villanueva have dreams for how their characters could grow in the show's already renewed Season Two.",
      "Villanueva hopes to showcase more of Princess\u2019s spirit in future episodes and see how she interacts with more of the wide cast of characters.",
      "\"The possibilities are endless, right?\" she says. \"I guess I'd love to see more patient interaction. It would be nice to see how she gets along with the residents \u2014 the new residents that we met last season. That'd be exciting.\"",
      "Abellera says she used small details from the show as well as her imagination to create background for Perlah. She believes that Perlah worked through COVID-19 alongside Dr. Robby, and outside of the hospital, she says her character is a single mom, identifies as queer and grew into her faith and culture as an adult.",
      "\u201cI wish that gets written in. I want that to happen,\u201d Abellera says. \u201cWhatever that means for the story, I would love that.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION\u00a0(May 30, 2025): A previous version of this article had a misspelling of Kristin Villanueva's last name."

But if they go into it trying to come up with viral phrases and sayings, it won\u2019t work,\u201d she cautions. \u201cAudiences are very smart, and they can always sense and feel when things are genuine and people are being authentic. That is what\u2019s always going to resonate with people. They can always suss out when people are being a little bit performative.\u201d"

    "summary": "With support from the United States, Taiwan is building up its defenses amid growing Chinese threats against the Beijing-claimed island.",
    "story": [
      "PINGTUNG COUNTY, Taiwan \u2014 Below a windy lookout, three U.S.-made mobile rocket launchers lurched forward at a military base in Taiwan, preparing for their first live-fire test on the Beijing-claimed island.",
      "\u201c3, 2, 1... launch,\u201d a Taiwan military officer counted down over a loudspeaker. A total of 33 rockets were then fired toward the Pacific Ocean, in the opposite direction from the Chinese mainland. Making a thunderous sound, each erupted in bursts of flame and trailed white smoke that arced high into the air.",
      "The historic test of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, took place this month at an undisclosed location in Pingtung County, on the southern tip of Taiwan, as Taipei scrambles to overhaul its military and get President Donald Trump\u2019s backing amid growing military threats from China.",
      "The rocket system could be crucial if Taiwan ever came under attack from Beijing, which has not ruled out the use of force in annexing the self-governing democracy.",
      "Manufactured by U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin, HIMARS mobile launchers are equipped with guided rockets that have a range of about 185 miles \u2014 far enough to reach coastal targets in the southern Chinese province of Fujian on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.",
      "It is the same rocket system that Ukrainian forces have been using to target Russian positions \u2014 though unlike Ukraine, Taiwan paid the United States more than $1 billion for the weaponry.",
      "The island has received 11 of the 29 HIMARS launchers it has purchased, with the rest expected to arrive ahead of schedule next year.",
      "Though the U.S. has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims, it is the island\u2019s biggest weapons supplier. Billions of dollars in arms deals with the U.S. have helped Taiwan build up asymmetric tools such as drones, missiles and upgraded fighter jets.",
      "As China ramps up military and other pressure, Taiwan has also extended compulsory military service to one year from four months, doubled mandatory annual refresher training for reservists to two weeks, and pledged to increase its defense budget to more than 3% of its gross domestic product.",
      "While the U.S. remains a \u201cvery important\u201d strategic partner, Taipei \u201cfully recognizes\u201d the need to strengthen its own defense capabilities, said Sun Li-fang, a spokesperson for the Taiwanese National Defense Ministry.",
      "\u201cEnsuring Taiwan\u2019s security is our responsibility and our top priority,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take this matter very seriously.\u201d",
      "But it is difficult for Taiwan to build a modern fighting force, Sun said, in the face of \u201cinherently disproportionate\u201d threats from China, whose 2.8-million-strong military is more than 18 times larger than Taiwan\u2019s number of active-duty personnel.",
      "In the year since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office, China has held several rounds of large-scale military exercises that Adm. Samuel J. Paparo, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned this month are not drills but \u201crehearsals.\u201d",
      "The Chinese military also sends warplanes and ships toward Taiwan on near-daily sorties and in recent days held an amphibious landing drill in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "To deal with such \u201ctangible and real\u201d threats, it is \u201ccrucial\u201d that the U.S. and Taiwan continue their military cooperation, Sun said.",
      "In addition to HIMARS, the U.S. and Taiwan have advanced their cooperation with an intelligence sharing deal that Sun called a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe typically don\u2019t go into detail because intelligence and information sharing are sensitive,\u201d Sun said in his government\u2019s first public comments on the subject.",
      "\u201cThat said, this kind of intelligence exchange is extremely helpful for us in understanding threats from the enemy and making appropriate defensive deployments.\u201d",
      "In congressional testimony this month, a retired U.S. Navy admiral also publicly acknowledged for the first time that there are about 500 U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan, more than 10 times the number previously disclosed.",
      "Even as it works with the U.S., Taiwan is unsure about the extent of the security commitment from Washington, which has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether U.S. forces would defend the island against a Chinese attack.",
      "Further muddling the picture are comments Trump has made about Taiwan, the global leader in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, \u201cstealing\u201d chip business from the U.S. and not paying enough for its own defense.",
      "Officials in Taipei have also been rattled by the collapse of U.S. support for Ukraine, as well as the threat of steep tariffs on Taiwan\u2019s exports, which Trump has set at 32% in addition to a 10% baseline.",
      "\u201cYou have different voices emerging from the United States, so that creates more uncertainties for Taiwanese,\u201d said Andrew Yang, Taiwan\u2019s former minister of national defense. \u201cWhich voices or narratives should we listen to?\u201d",
      "Reservist Jason Chu, 30, said that among those around him, there was a \u201cgrowing\u201d sense of responsibility to defend Taiwan.",
      "\u201cThe biggest difference lies in our mindset,\u201d Chu, an engineer, said. He said that while many people in Taiwan most likely think of their training as a duty at first, often they later begin to think of it as protecting their country.",
      "People in Taiwan have watched with concern as war drags on Ukraine, another democracy targeted by a larger, autocratic neighbor \u2014 and some have even gone to join the fight against Russia.",
      "Tony Lu went to Ukraine in 2022 first as a volunteer, then as a fighter. He said he thinks people in Taiwan need to be ready.",
      "\u201cNo one wants war \u2014 I don\u2019t want it either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d"

      "Those were the desperate scenes that marked the first turbulent week of a new U.S. and Israel-backed plan for aid distribution in the enclave.",
      "The United Nations World Food Programme said in a statement Wednesday that \u201chordes of hungry people\u201d broke into its Al-Ghafari warehouse in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah attempting to get supplies being prepared for distribution.",
      "The UNWFP cited \"initial reports\" that at least two people were killed and several more injured in the incident. NBC News was not immediately able to independently verify those details.",
      "An Israeli military spokesperson said they were not aware of their forces being connected to the reported deaths, or of any shots being fired by troops.",
      "Those reported deaths came after chaotic events Tuesday, when thousands of hungry Palestinians flooded a controversial new aid distribution center set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation \u2014 or GHF \u2014 which is tasked with distributing supplies in the U.S. and Israel-backed plan that came into effect Monday.",
      "In that case, Israeli soldiers fired live rounds into the air to disperse crowds, with the GHF seeking to quell concerns over its rocky first week of operations in a news release Wednesday.",
      "The GHF rejected the claims of Gaza's Hamas-run government media office that three Palestinians were killed, 46 others injured and seven people missing after the incident. The foundation said that no one was killed while trying to access its distribution site.",
      "A spokesperson for GHF said in an email that the account was \u201ccompletely false\u201d and that nobody had been injured or killed during the foundation's first three days of operations.",
      "NBC News was not immediately able to verify the facts on the ground.",
      "GHF was tasked with distributing aid in Gaza after Israel earlier this month lifted an almost three-month-long blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies following warnings of rising starvation in the enclave.",
      "Under the plan, aid will be distributed from at least four distribution points in southern Gaza, with the aim of expanding with additional sites.",
      "The United Nations, which has refused to participate in the plan, has condemned the initiative as a \u201cdistraction\u201d that undermines a long-standing humanitarian framework in Gaza. The U.N. says the effort poses a threat to the independence of aid operations, while simultaneously displacing Palestinians en masse to Gaza's south.",
      "Israel has maintained that a new aid distribution system was necessary, alleging that Hamas was diverting supplies. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other humanitarian groups have told NBC News that they have not seen evidence of aid being diverted to Hamas or other armed groups during the war.",
      "Israel has long been deeply critical of the United Nations and its work in the Gaza Strip and the broader Palestinian territories."

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel said Thursday it would establish 22 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \u201cstrengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the biblical term for the West Bank, \u201canchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\u201d",
      "He added it was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and public parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",
      "During his first term, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel\u2019s claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth."

    "story": [
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles III outlined new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s government priorities at the country's Parliament on Tuesday in what is being seen as a show of support in the face of President Donald Trump's threats to annex America's neighbor.",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles will return to the U.K. later Tuesday, after the speech and a visit to Canada\u2019s National War Memorial."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 If President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t want international students at Harvard, there are plenty of foreign governments and universities happy to take them \u2014 along with their talents that have helped make the United States a global tech and scientific leader.",
      "The future of international students at the oldest, richest and most renowned university in the U.S. is uncertain after the Trump administration announced a ban on their enrollment starting in the 2025-26 academic year.",
      "After Harvard refused to turn over extensive data about its international students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the school was being held accountable for \u201cfostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus.\u201d",
      "Harvard has sued over the move, calling it unlawful, and on Friday a federal judge in Boston put it on hold for two weeks. If the Trump administration prevails, new international students would be barred from enrolling at Harvard while current ones would be forced to either transfer elsewhere or lose their legal status.",
      "U.S. universities including Harvard rely heavily on international students, who often pay far more in tuition than their American classmates. Many of them end up staying in the U.S., where they have been responsible for major breakthroughs in strategically important fields such as artificial intelligence where the U.S., China and other nations are locked in intense competition.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign against Harvard is a \u201cterrible policy error\u201d that could undermine the world-leading role the U.S. has played in research and development since World War II, Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "A downturn in international students would affect American universities\u2019 \u201ctalent pipeline\u201d and income, while benefiting U.S. competitors, he said. \u201cChina will become significantly more attractive than before to students and researchers from the Global South,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWestern Europe will also gain significantly.\u201d",
      "There was already growing unease among international students at U.S. universities amid anti-immigrant rhetoric by Trump, in addition to deep funding cuts and efforts to intervene in universities\u2019 internal operations. Hundreds of students\u2019 visas have been revoked, while the Trump administration has detained and sought to deport others over pro-Palestinian and other activism.",
      "At Harvard, more than a quarter of the student body of about 25,000 comes from overseas and the looming ban has caught up students from more than 140 countries, including the future queen of Belgium.",
      "Harvard\u2019s biggest group of overseas students, about 20%, come from China, which was long the top source of international students in the U.S. before being overtaken by India last year.",
      "The number of Chinese students in the U.S. has been dropping \u2014to about 277,000 during the 2023-24 school year, compared with more than 372,000 in 2019-20 \u2014 due to disruptions from the Covid pandemic as well as growing U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Chinese academics were also driven away by the China Initiative, a national security program from Trump\u2019s first term that drew accusations of racial profiling. Many of them have moved their research to Chinese universities.",
      "Responding to the Harvard ban, Beijing said U.S.-China educational cooperation is \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d and that it would \u201csafeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars overseas.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina has consistently opposed the politicization of educational exchanges,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Friday. \u201cSuch actions by the U.S. will only damage its own image and international credibility.\u201d",
      "Izzy Shen, 23, an incoming Harvard student from Beijing, said her  visa application was refused hours after Trump\u2019s Harvard ban.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so fast,\u201d said Shen, whose application had already been marked \u201capproved.\u201d",
      "Shen, who was admitted to Harvard\u2019s Master in Design Engineering program, said she remained \u201crelatively optimistic\u201d and that the situation would \u201cget clearer\u201d after the injunction hearing Thursday.",
      "Duo Yi, who was admitted to the public policy doctoral program at Harvard Kennedy School, said she is now exploring other options amid growing uncertainty about her enrolment. Trump is \u201csimply too unpredictable,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no way of knowing what direction his future policies will take.\u201d",
      "Foreign governments and universities are not waiting to woo the Harvard students spurned by Trump. In the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, officials have urged universities to take proactive action \u201cto attract top talent.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cdoors are wide open\u201d to \u201cany students who face discrimination and unfair treatment in the U.S.,\u201d John Lee, the city\u2019s top leader, said Tuesday.",
      "Hong Kong has four universities in the top 100 of U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Global Universities Rankings, which is topped by Harvard, though experts say academic freedom in the former British colony of 7.5 million people has eroded since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020.",
      "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said Friday that Harvard undergraduates and postgraduates, as well as students with confirmed offers of admission, were welcome to study there instead.",
      "Europe has also sought to lure scientists worried about funding cuts and freedom of research under Trump, launching a $570 million initiative this month called \u201cChoose Europe.\u201d",
      "Though she did not mention Trump by name, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized \u201cfree and open research\u201d in a speech promoting the initiative at Sorbonne University in Paris.",
      "\u201cAs threats rise across the world, Europe will not compromise on its principles,\u201d she said. \u201cEurope must remain the home of academic and scientific freedom.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about the Harvard ban, Alex Zeng, an overseas education consultant based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, said American universities remained the top choice for many Chinese students.",
      "\u201cThe rich still want to go to the U.S. for education,\u201d Zeng said."

      "Wracked by violence in which thousands of civilians have been slaughtered, aid camps burned to the ground and hundreds of children raped, Africa\u2019s largest war has torn Sudan apart and forced more than 12 million people from their homes.",
      "The cataclysmic battle for supremacy has pitted the Sudanese military, controlled by the country\u2019s top commander, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Daglo Mousa \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti.",
      "The conflict has created the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations, which says at least 24,000 people have been killed, though activists say the number is far higher.",
      "Both sides face war crimes accusations from the United States, which sanctioned the northeast African nation's government for using chemical weapons Thursday \u2014 a claim it denied.",
      "The RSF meanwhile, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing in the country where \u201csome 30.4 million people \u2014 over two thirds of the total population \u2014 are in need of assistance, from health to food and other forms of humanitarian support,\u201d according to a February report from the United Nations refugee agency.",
      "After the war entered its third year last month, NBC News spoke to three people who have been caught in the crossfire.",
      "\u2018You just have to walk\u2019",
      "Around seven months pregnant with her first child, Abeir Abdelrahman said she was resigned to losing her baby as she fled her home in the Jabra neighborhood in the south of Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, which had been overrun by RSF gunmen in September 2023, five months after the fighting began.",
      "\u201cYou have to walk. Just walk. And you have to walk quickly because at any time bombs and shots are going to be there,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview this month. \u201cAt one point I thought: \u2018It\u2019s OK. You lose the baby, but you will be alive with your family. You\u2019ll be safe with your husband, so God will give it to you again,\u2019\u201d she added.",
      "But as they trekked south, she said they lost contact with her 63-year-old father, who had fallen behind. After four days of frantic backtracking, she said they discovered he had been arrested at an RSF checkpoint and accused of stealing his own belongings.",
      "\u201cWe were all very scared,\u201d she said, adding that they feared he might be shot. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t eat for a long time,\u201d she said. Around the same time she found out that her brother, who had decided to stay home, had been seriously wounded in a rocket attack, she said.",
      "After 35 days in captivity, Abdelrahman said her father was released. Although he had cholera and malaria, he was relatively unharmed, she said. Her brother survived surgery despite almost losing a leg.",
      "Abdelrahman moved with the rest of her family farther south to Jazirah state, where she gave birth to her daughter, Samiya, now 16 months old.",
      "\u201cEveryone was in tears, my mom, me and dad, just a moment full of joy, and I just felt lucky, and I felt blessed that God helped me and protected her,\u201d said Abdelrahman, who is now teaching English in the eastern city of Kassala.",
      "\u201cSamiya is a girl of the war because she\u2019s strong. And whenever she\u2019s going through things in her life, even when she gets bigger, I\u2019m sure she will overcome them,\u201d she added.",
      "\u2018Guns at my face\u2019",
      "Others like, Amr Ali, 39, did not get the chance to flee.",
      "An IT worker and freelance photographer, he said he spent 10 years in the Netherlands before returning to Sudan in August 2021 with plans to open a photography business and settle down.",
      "Just over two years later, as the fighting neared his home in eastern Khartoum, he said he recorded final messages for his mom and sister with \u201cthe sound of the shooting and the bombing\u201d in the background.",
      "On Oct. 5, 2023, as bullets ripped into his apartment and rockets exploded nearby, he said he hid under his bed. When he emerged, he said eight or nine RSF members had surrounded him and asked if he was a member of the military.",
      "Refusing to believe he was a civilian, Ali said they started \u201cbeating me like crazy.\u201d Accusing him of being in the military, he said they \u201cwere just pointing guns at my face, shooting it next to my ears, next to my feet\u201d and threatening to kill him.",
      "Transferred to a nearby gas station that had been turned into a makeshift prison, he said he was hit with \u201cso many hands, so many punches, so many slaps and the kicking and kicking.\u201d",
      "He said he could smell \u201cweed and alcohol\u201d on the breath of the fighters who hit him with pipes and sticks and threatened to shoot him in mock executions. The beatings only stopped at night after other RSF fighters complained about the screaming because they were trying to sleep, Ali added.",
      "After 10 days, Ali said he was allowed to contact his family who provided evidence that he was a civilian. This, he said, led to a complete change in attitude from his captors, who took him somewhere for a shower and gave him new clothes. Over a large meal, he said an RSF member apologized for his mistreatment.",
      "\u201cI was just confused. We\u2019d gone from beating and \u2018We will kill you\u2019 and \u2018We will destroy you\u2019, to \u2018Sorry, we will take care of you,\u2019\u201d Ali said.",
      "After he was released on Oct. 31, he said he immediately sought medical treatment. His hand had to be re-broken so it could heal properly, he added.",
      "Then he fled Sudan for Egypt, where he is waiting to be resettled by the U.N. Asked whether he accepted the RSF\u2019s apology, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not. They ruined my country.\u201d",
      "\u2018We had to find a way out\u2019",
      "Just across the River Nile in the city of Omdurman, Natasha, a British mother of four, said the \u201cbombing became so bad\u201d they had to leave her home where the army had set up positions on the roof. NBC News agreed not to use her last name because she fears for her safety.",
      "With her husband back in the U.K., she said she moved in with her mother-in-law, Asmaa, 70, and over the course of 18 months watched as law and order broke down and armed gangs roamed the neighborhood \u201cstealing from houses and people were getting killed.\u201d",
      "A 12-year-old friend of her son \u201cwas shot by a sniper,\u201d Natasha, 47, tearfully recalled, adding that the bullet \u201cwent through him and it went through his sister.\u201d",
      "His death was the catalyst in her decision to leave her home, she said, adding that electricity and water had begun to cut out and food had become scarce.",
      "With kidnapping common in Sudan, she said she knew her status as a foreigner with white skin made things \u201cvery, very dangerous\u201d for her, so she donned sunglasses and wrapped herself from head to toe before they made their escape in a rickshaw in September.",
      "\u201cI thought: \u2018OK, I might die on my way out. You know, if I don\u2019t do this I\u2019m going to die. I can\u2019t just sit here like this. One of us is going to get shot.\u2019 So it was just a numb feeling,\u201d Natasha said.",
      "She said that her driver cleared RSF checkpoints without stopping, before dropping her off near a military checkpoint.",
      "As they neared, Natasha said soldiers fired above their heads and she quickly waved a piece of white clothing. The shooting stopped and they were allowed across the checkpoint.",
      "\u201cI just remember when my husband\u2019s mum said to me, \u2018That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. You can take off your shades,\u2019\u201d Natasha said, starting to cry.",
      "After the military regained control of Omdurman, she said she was planning to move to a nicer part of the city and open another kindergarten.",
      "War crimes and hunger",
      "Sudan\u2019s military said Tuesday it had taken full control of the Greater Khartoum region, but the RSF still controls most of the western region of Darfur and some other areas where battles continue to rage.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. In March the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund reported that armed men have raped hundreds of children, including some as young as 1.",
      "On Thursday, the United States said it would impose sanctions on\u00a0Sudan's government after it determined that Sudan used chemical weapons last year. They will include limits on U.S. exports and government lines of credit, and they will take effect around June 6, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Sudan rejected the move and described the allegations as false in a statement.",
      "Nonetheless, 24.6 million people, or around half the population, face acute hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 an organization that sets a scale the United Nations and governments use to assess hunger.",
      "\u201cI did my very best not to leave Sudan, but yeah, the situation just wasn\u2019t really helping,\u201d Ali, the photographer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d"

      "Torrents of predawn rain unleashed flooding that killed at least 111 people in a market town where northern Nigerian farmers sell their wares to traders from the south, officials said Friday, predicting the death toll would grow.",
      "The Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency did not immediately say how much rain fell after midnight Thursday in the town of Mokwa in the state of Niger more than 180 miles west of Abuja, the capital of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.",
      "Communities in northern Nigeria have been experiencing prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change and excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during the brief wet season.",
      "In videos and photos on social media, floodwaters covered neighborhoods and homes were submerged, with their roofs barely visible above the brown colored waters. Waist-deep in water, residents tried to salvage what they could, or rescue others.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific on Saturday that they will not be left alone to face increasing military and economic pressure from China, while insisting that they also contribute more to their own defense.",
      "He said Washington will bolster its defenses overseas to counter what the Pentagon sees as rapidly developing threats by Beijing, particularly in its aggressive stance toward Taiwan. China has conducted numerous exercises to test what a blockade would look like of the self-governing island, which Beijing claims as its own and the U.S. has pledged to defend.",
      "China\u2019s army \u201cis rehearsing for the real deal,\u201d Hegseth said in a keynote speech at a security conference in Singapore. \u201cWe are not going to sugarcoat it \u2014 the threat China poses is real. And it could be imminent.\u201d",
      "China has a stated goal of having its military have the capability to take Taiwan by force if necessary by 2027, a deadline that is seen by experts as more of an aspirational goal than a hard war deadline.",
      "But China also has built sophisticated man-made islands in the South China Sea to support new military outposts and developed highly advanced hypersonic and space capabilities, which are driving the United States to create its own space-based \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defenses.",
      "Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference hosted by the International Institute for Security Studies, Hegseth said China is no longer just building up its military forces to take Taiwan, it\u2019s \u201cactively training for it, every day.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also called out China for its ambitions in Latin America, particularly its efforts to increase its influence over the Panama Canal.",
      "He urged countries in the region to increase defense spending to levels similar to the 5% of their gross domestic product European nations are now pressed to contribute.",
      "\u201cWe must all do our part,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Following the speech, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat Kaja Kallas pushed back at Hegseth\u2019s comment that European countries should focus their defense efforts in their own region and leave the Indo-Pacific more to the U.S. She said that with North Korean troops fighting for Russia and China supporting Moscow, European and Asian security were \u201cvery much interlinked.\u201d",
      "He also repeated a pledge made by previous administrations to bolster U.S. military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific to provide a more robust deterrent. While both the Obama and Biden administrations had also committed to pivoting to the Pacific and established new military agreements throughout the region, a full shift has never been realized.",
      "Instead, U.S. military resources from the Indo-Pacific have been regularly pulled to support military needs in the Middle East and Europe, especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In the first few months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, that\u2019s also been the case.",
      "In the last few months the Trump administration has taken a Patriot missile defense battalion out of the Indo-Pacific in order to send it to the Middle East, a massive logistical operation that required 73 military cargo aircraft flights, and sent Coast Guard ships back to the U.S. to help defend the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Hegseth also cautioned that playing both sides, seeking U.S. military support and Chinese economic support, carries risk.",
      "\u201cEconomic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Asked how he would reconcile that statement with Trump\u2019s threat of steep tariffs on most in the region, Hegseth he was \u201cin the business of tanks, not trade.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s Defense Minister Richard Marles welcomed Hegseth\u2019s assurance that the Indo-Pacific was an American strategic priority and agreed that Australia and other nations needed to do their part.",
      "\u201cReality is that there is no effective balance of power in this region absent the United States, but we cannot leave it to the United States alone,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Marles suggested the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive trade policies were counterproductive. \u201cThe shock and disruption from the high tariffs has been costly and destabilizing.\u201d",
      "China usually sends its own defense minister to this conference, but Dong Jun did not attend this year in a snub to the U.S. over the erratic tariff war Trump has ignited with Beijing. Their absence was something the U.S. delegation said it intended to capitalize on.",
      "\u201cWe are here this morning. And somebody else isn\u2019t,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth said committing U.S. support for Indo-Pacific nations would not require local governments to align with the West on cultural or climate issues.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the U.S. can or wants to supplant China as the region\u2019s primary economic driver. But Hegseth\u2019s push follows Trump\u2019s visit to the Middle East, which resulted in billions of dollars in new defense agreements."

      "NEW YORK \u2014 A former Goldman Sachs banker was sentenced Thursday to two years in federal prison for his role in a $4.5 billion scheme to ransack a Malaysian state investment fund.",
      "Tim Leissner, at his sentencing in Brooklyn federal court, apologized to the people of Malaysia, who he called the \u201creal victims\u201d of the scheme.",
      "\u201cThe funds raised more than a decade ago could have profoundly benefited the nation and its citizens,\u201d he said in a statement read in court and provided by his lawyers. \u201cInstead, due to my greed \u2014 and the greed of those involved alongside me \u2014 they were misappropriated.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Leissner and other Goldman Sachs bankers helped the Malaysian investment fund known as 1MDB, or the 1Malaysia Development Berhad state fund, raise $6.5 billion through bond sales.",
      "But they say more than $4.5 billion of the funds were stolen and laundered through bribes and kickbacks.",
      "The spoils bankrolled extravagant purchases, from wild parties to lavish spending on jewels, art, a superyacht and luxury real estate, prosecutors have said. They also helped finance the 2013 Martin Scorsese film \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d that starred Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "The scandal led to the fall of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's government in 2018. Najib was later convicted by a Malaysian court of abuse of power and other crimes related to the scandal and sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "\u201cWhat we did was unequivocally wrong, and I take full responsibility for my role,\u201d Leissner said Thursday. \u201cI deeply regret my actions, and if I could turn back time, I would undo them without hesitation.\u201d",

      "TOKYO, Japan \u2014 China will resume Japanese seafood imports it banned in 2023 over worries about Japan\u2019s discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, a Japanese official said Friday.",
      "China said their talks this week made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d but did not confirm an agreement with Japan on the issue that has been a significant political and diplomatic point of tension.",
      "Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the agreement was reached after Japanese and Chinese officials met in Beijing and that imports would resume once the paperwork is complete.",
      "\u201cSeafood is an important export item for Japan and a resumption of its export to China is a major milestone,\u201d Koizumi said.",
      "Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya also welcomed the move, saying, \u201cIt will be a big first step that would help Japan and China to tackle a number of remaining issues between the two countries,\u201d such as disputes over territory, trade and wartime history.",
      "But officials said China's ban on farm and fisheries products from 10 Japanese prefectures including Fukushima is still in place and that they will keep pushing toward their lifting.",
      "China's General Administration of Customs, in a statement issued Friday, said the two sides on Wednesday held \u201ca new round of technical exchanges on the safety issues of Japanese aquatic products ... and achieved substantial progress\u201d but did not mention an agreement.",
      "China blocked imports of Japanese seafood because it said the release of the treated and diluted but still slightly radioactive wastewater would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities in eastern China.",
      "Japanese officials have said the wastewater will be safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligible. They say the wastewater must be released to make room for the nuclear plant\u2019s decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks.",
      "Tokyo and Beijing since March held three rounds of talks on the issue before reaching the agreement on Wednesday on the \u201ctechnical requirements\u201d necessary for Japanese seafood exports to China to restart, Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It did not say how long it may take before the actual resumption.",
      "Mainland China used to be the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood, accounting for more than one-fifth of its seafood exports, followed by Hong Kong. The ban became a major blow to the fisheries industry, though the impact on overall trade was limited because seafood exports are a fraction of Japan\u2019s total exports.",
      "Japan\u2019s government set up an emergency relief fund for Japanese exporters, especially scallop growers, and has sought alternative overseas markets.",
      "Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which operates the Fukushima Daiichi plant, has said it will compensate Japanese business owners appropriately for damages from export bans.",
      "The nuclear plant had meltdowns in three reactors after being heavily damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that struck northeastern Japan. Water used to cool the reactor cores has been accumulating ever since, and officials say the massive stockpile is hampering the cleanup of the site.",
      "The wastewater was treated and heavily diluted with seawater to reduce the radioactivity as much as possible before Japan began releasing it into the sea in August 2023.",
      "Last September, then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the two sides reached \u201ca certain level of mutual understanding\u201d that China would start working toward easing the import ban and join the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s expanded monitoring of wastewater discharges.",
      "People inside and outside Japan protested the initial wastewater release. Japanese fishing groups said they feared it would further damage the reputation of their seafood. Groups in China and South Korea also raised concerns."

      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out whether or not he\u2019s tapping us along or not, and if he is, we\u2019ll respond a little bit differently,\u201d Trump added."
