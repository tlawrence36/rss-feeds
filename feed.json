      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",
      "Villaz\u00f3n's \u201cWerther\u201d debuted in 2011, and he directed Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d the following year at Baden-Baden, Germany, while also singing Nemorino.",
      "He has gone on to direct Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s \u201cDon Pasquale,\u201d Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus,\u201d Rameau\u2019s \u201cPlat\u00e9e,\u201d Bellini\u2019s \u201cI Puritani\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d and has upcoming productions of Mozart\u2019s \u201c Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

      "Yet much of the most extensive work to give \u201cRoofman\u201d veracity was below the surface. Manchester is currently serving out his sentence at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. He can only make outgoing calls, but Cianfrance estimates that he spoke to him more than a hundred times. That gave Cianfrance an understanding of Manchester\u2019s motives and mistakes and turned \u201cRoofman\u201d into a comic but tender examination of misguided materialism.",
      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",
      "Tatum also spoke frequently with Manchester by phone. Manchester, among other things, expressed his approval of the movie poster, featuring Tatum with a stuffed bear on his shoulders, a floaty around his waist and a gun in his right hand. Tatum says they bonded talking about their children and their hopes for the future. Manchester is scheduled to be released in 2036.",
      "\u201cI got more than I could possibly convey. I just found myself being held almost by him, taken care of,\u201d Tatum says. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up bad. But I definitely am a couple bad decisions away from hopefully not being in jail for 45 years. But I think we\u2019re all one or two bad decisions away from having a completely different life. Jeff did tell me, \u2018I got greedy.\u2019\u201d",
      "As he prepped the movie, Cianfrance interviewed everyone he could who was associated with Manchester\u2019s escape. Usually, he gave them parts. Wainscott plays a crossing guard in the film. The pastor of the church attended by Manchester, Ron Smith, plays a pawnshop owner. Dunst is interrogated by the police officers who actually interviewed Wainscott.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the actor\u2019s responsibility at all to express anything in public. Ever,\u201d Garfield said, using his hands for extra emphasis. \u201cPlease, tell them about the gesticulation.\u201d",
      "Roberts chimed in: \u201cThe hair as well.\u201d (It was bouncing).",
      "With \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d in theaters Friday, Guadagnino and his actors knew they were making something thorny, something challenging, about messy, imperfect people whose lives, and lies, are upended with the accusation. They were ready to own the decision to use a typeface in the opening credits made famous by Woody Allen. But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield). Edebiri is a student named Maggie, a child of billionaires who everyone says is brilliant and who is a little obsessed with Alma.",
      "After a boozy party at Alma\u2019s, Maggie comes to Alma first to tell her that Hank crossed the line. Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",
      "The screenplay comes from Nora Garrett, who was working as a data analyst at Meta before her script caught the attention of Guadagnino and Roberts, in quick succession.",
      "\u201cThe story really started with the character of Alma,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was really interested in this idea of a woman who had a lie or something that she was deeply ashamed of at the core of her being.\u201d",
      "But Alma's controlled compartmentalization of her past starts to unspool with Maggie's accusation. The part allows Roberts to do some of her best work in years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying something that might sound obvious, but she\u2019s one of the greatest stars and one of the great actresses,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cThe symbol, the beauty of the symbol, and at the same time the truth of the performance. She\u2019s so three-dimensional.\u201d",
      "Roberts was particularly fascinated by Alma\u2019s relationship with her husband, Frederik, a shrink played by Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg, whose unexpected choices had her in awe.",
      "\u201cI did catch myself watching him a couple of times instead of being in the scene and I was just like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s so (expletive) good,\u2019\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd then I think, \u2018Oh, I have a line.\u2019\u201d",

Garfield, who Guadagnino has been trying to work with for almost 20 years, had to do one of his most emotional scenes on his first day.

      "\u201cHe wants urgency, he wants you to be a little bit on the balls of your feet,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cSo when it comes time to shoot, it\u2019s like the train has left the station and you just hold on for dear life or you get taken by it in a way. That\u2019s really exciting.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought a lot about films that have been able to resist the pressure of time and to become some insightful classics,\u201d Guadagnino said.",
      "Perhaps the most inscrutable of the bunch is Maggie. Even Edebiri said she had some trouble wrapping her head around her motivations and actions.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a tricky girl,\u201d Edebiri said. \u201cA word Luca kept using a lot in conversations was displacement. Maggie\u2019s such a displaced person psychologically, but also as a transracial adoptee, and occupying this space full of these professors who are performing.\u201d",
      "But the point for all are the questions, not the answers, and \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is not a film that wraps anything up in a tidy morality. Those conversations are for the audience to have.",
      "\u201cThere are very few filmmakers who are alive for whom the priority is radical, vulnerable, unbridled self-expression and exploration and curiosity rather than something didactic,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cThe conversation is the thing, I think, that\u2019s the most we can ever dream of, that people will be confronted by their own response. The film hopefully is a mirror for every person watching, and then they can compare reflections with each other.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",
      "Berk said Carwyle \u201ctraveled thousands of miles over a year ago \u201cafter sending thousands of messages\" that reflected \u201chis delusions and intentions to not just make contact with Ms. Aniston, but to commit criminal wrongs against her, sexual violence against her.\u201d She added that Carwyle stressed in his messaging that he \u201cwould be unabated by doctors or others or FBI intervening.\u201d",
      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions. The prosecution also argued there\u2019s no evidence that Carwyle\u2019s delusions toward Aniston have stopped, even with medication.",

      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",

      "For Taylor Swift\u2019s most dedicated audience, a new album means new opportunities to decode Easter eggs in her lyrics and music videos. The pop superstar\u2019s 12th studio album has no shortage of clever clues and references to her public life and discography. Many are opaque, revealing just enough to inspire a myriad of fan theories. Others are concrete \u2013 explicit names and places worth exploring. Below, you will find a guide to those instances, and how they relate to Swift.",
      "Read on, and happy digging!",
      "Lyric: \u201cThat view of Portofino was on my mind / When you called me at the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e\u201d",

And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e? That\u2019s a luxury hotel in Paris.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBe my NY when Hollywood hates me\u201d",
      "Meaning: Both locations make appearances in Swift\u2019s songwriting. Among them: \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d from 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and \u201cWhite Horse\u201d from 2008\u2019s \u201cFearless.\u201d She also owns property in both locations.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBabe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust \u2026 just kidding\u201d",
      "Meaning: In August of this year, Swift announced her engagement to Kelce by posting a carousel of images on Instagram. Eagle-eyed fans noticed that the ring wasn\u2019t the only jewelry she was showing off. She was also wearing a Cartier watch.",

      "Lyric: \u201cBut as the 50 Cent song played\u201d",
      "Meaning: A 50 Cent reference further implies this song is rooted in Swift\u2019s teen years in the \u201900s, when the rapper was at the height of his popularity. The song also mentions \u201cprom\u201d and \u201csecond period,\u201d what is typically associated with high school.",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhen I left school, I lost track of you / Abigail called me with the bad news / Goodbye\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

But sonically, it is a thoughtful acoustic ballad with emo movement, in which Swift contends with her \u201cterminal uniqueness\u201d and deep dedication to a loved one.

      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

When he tries to give up opioids, he takes her late-night drinking as a provocation. \u201cTreat me like a man,\u201d he tells her.",
      "It\u2019s an awkward, perhaps judgmental characterization that would be all the more glaring if it weren\u2019t for Blunt\u2019s tact as a performer. But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",
      "In his films with his brother, Safdie has long brought real-life figures into their movie worlds, blurring fictional boundaries. Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the bricks and mortar and the architecture that surrounds people everywhere,\u201d says Emun Elliott, who plays one of the detectives. \u201cThere might be a piece of that stolen gold in your wedding ring. It is everywhere.\u201d",
      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",
      "One real person who is portrayed in the series is Brian Boyce, the principled and determined lead investigator, played by \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d star Hugh Bonneville.",
      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",
      "Forsyth says the series' first episode attracted some 10 million viewers in the U.K. \u2014 or 1 in 5 of the adult population. He says he was in a restaurant with his wife once when the nearby table spent the whole meal discussing it, which was \u201csomewhat unnerving.\u201d",
      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "Eight years ago, the great Daniel Day-Lewis said he was finished with acting",
      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",
      "But they haven't seen each other in two decades, their bond torn asunder by some unrevealed trauma that led them to each seek comfort \u2014 or absolution \u2014 in different places. Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival. Ronan Day-Lewis, a painter making his feature directorial debut, is at his best in creating, along with cinematographer Ben Fordesman, a sense of the unpredictability of nature, culminating in a dramatic hailstorm.",

We know that Jem has brought with him a letter from Nessa (Samantha Morton), that Ray at first does not read. But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",
      "Will Ray find a way to come in from the cold and reconnect with his son? The artistic parallels are a little too neat to ignore \u2014 a son bringing Day-Lewis the actor back into view, for the benefit of us all.",
      "Will he stay? Let\u2019s hope that even if Day-Lewis assures us anew that he's finished, he'll once again be exaggerating.",
      "\u201cAnemone,\u201d a Focus Films release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor language throughout.\u201d Running time: 121 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

The news hit me hard: She was 14, the same age as my youngest daughter, and the lioness responsible may have been one of the animals we see in our neighborhood almost weekly.",
      "Our children are growing up in a part of Nairobi where lions roam free. We see them while taking our kids to school. We\u2019ve lost pets and livestock. Neighborhood WhatsApp groups share warnings when big cats come close \u2014 and feature CCTV footage of lions hunting family pets.",
      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",
      "\u201cDuring the rainy season, tall grass and shifting herbivore patterns make it difficult for carnivores to hunt,\u201d KWS wrote on a reel of a Nairobi lion cub rescue posted to its social media in July. The cub in the video had been seen starving in the park, causing a public outcry. KWS added it was \u201cconducting a feeding intervention, providing meat daily to the pride residing in the park to help them regain their strength and resume natural hunting.\u201d",
      "Nairobi National Park, bordering the city to the north, has long relied on vast southern grazing lands for its wildlife to migrate to other protected areas. With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south. There are also nongovernment initiatives that pay landowners bordering Nairobi National Park a small annual fee to keep their properties unfenced for wildlife.",
      "But will it be enough?",
      "What\u2019s missing is greater awareness on how to behave around predators, especially among increasingly urban communities who are coming into contact with them.",
      "My children never learned this in school. Their closest encounter with a lion was in 2020, when we took advantage of a post-COVID bookings slump to show them the Maasai Mara National Reserve. An incredibly knowledgeable local guide led us through the southern reserve in a completely open safari vehicle, surrounded by surging wildebeest.",
      "On one outing, our guide stopped the car for a passing trio of hunting lionesses. The first strode by, ignoring us. The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",
      "\u201cKeep still,\u201d the guide murmured under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d",
      "Her curiosity satisfied, the lioness ducked under the car and moved on.",
      "That day, we learned a lesson in predator behavior during a holiday experience very few Kenyans can afford. It may have recently saved my wife\u2019s life when she encountered a lioness in our garden. Checking to see what our dog was barking at, she spotted a lioness under a bush less than 10 yards away.

      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",

I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",

      "But in a Sept. 26 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, three pediatricians, including two with the Yale School of Medicine, said they reviewed the case and \u201care convinced that Nikki was a victim of child abuse.\u201d",
      "Roberson was arrested after he took Nikki to a hospital when she became unresponsive following a fall off their bed. He said he had never heard of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "\u201cIt was bad enough losing my little girl. And then when they accused me of it, I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Roberson said.",
      "In a press release issued after Roberson\u2019s execution was delayed last year as well as in recent court filings, Paxton\u2019s office has stressed that \u201cthis was no mere shaken baby case but involved a child who was beaten and received multiple blows to the head.\u201d Paxton\u2019s office said the jury \u201cdid not convict Roberson on the basis of \u2018Shaken Baby Syndrome.\u2019\u201d",
      "Yet one of the jurors who convicted Roberson, Terre Compton, told lawmakers last year that, \u201ceverything that was presented to us was all about shaken baby syndrome. That is what our decision was based on.\u201d",
      "Grisham, who is writing a book about the case, said Roberson's trial \u201cwas grossly unfair\u201d because his autism contributed to people believing he was guilty and his defense lawyers told jurors it was a case of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Roberson said he remains optimistic he will one day get a chance to prove his innocence with a new trial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scared to die, but I\u2019m not ready to die, you know. I would like to believe God has more for me to do and stuff, you know,\u201d Roberson said.",

But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",

But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",

Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has adopted recommendations by a new group of vaccine advisers, and has stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for anyone",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has adopted recommendations by a new group of vaccine advisers, and stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for anyone \u2014 leaving the choice up to patients.",
      "The government health agency on Monday announced it has adopted recommendations made last month by advisers picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Before this year, U.S. health officials \u2014 following recommendations by infectious disease experts \u2014 recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection against the coronavirus as it continues to evolve.",
      "As the COVID-19 pandemic waned, experts increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most at risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "But Kennedy, who has questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, abruptly announced in May that COVID-19 vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. He also dismissed the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with a handpicked group.",
      "The new group voted last month to say all Americans should make their own decisions. But the CDC also says vaccine decisions, especially for seniors, should involve checking with a doctor, nurse or pharmacist.",
      "The recommendation was endorsed by Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill, who is serving as the CDC\u2019s acting director. O\u2019Neill signed off on it last week, but HHS officials announced it Monday.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "In a statement Monday, O\u2019Neill celebrated the change, saying past guidance \"deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination.\u201d",
      "\u201cInformed consent is back,\u201d O'Neill said in a statement some doctors objected to.",
      "Doctors routinely discuss vaccines with patients and parents, and share printed information about the risks and benefits of each shot, said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired New York physician who has coauthored several American Academy of Pediatrics policy statements on vaccinations.",

      "Major medical societies continue to recommend shots for younger children, pregnant women and others at higher risk of severe illness. They say the Trump administration's discussion of risk overemphasizes rare side effects and doesn't account for the dangers of coronavirus infection itself.",
      "The decision clears the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program to ship COVID-19 vaccine doses. The program provides routine vaccinations at no cost to children whose families qualify.",
      "O\u2019Neill also signed off on a panel recommendation that children under 4 get their first vaccine dose for varicella \u2014 also known as chickenpox \u2014 as a standalone shot rather than in combination shot with measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "There is a single shot that contains all four, but it carries a higher risk of fevers and fever-related seizures. Since 2009, the CDC had said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already get the chickenpox vaccine separately.",

      "Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.",
      "They say the Trump administration's termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.",
      "The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others \u2014 including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors \u2014 detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.",
      "Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program's termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.",
      "The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, \u201cthe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"",
      "The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,\u201d said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,\u201d she added in a statement.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",

      "Couples should never go to bed angry, right",
      "It\u2019s late at night, and you have been stewing all day about something your partner did to annoy you. The time to resolve it is now because, as everyone knows, you should never go to bed angry, right?",
      "Though it\u2019s conventional wisdom, many relationship experts say sticking to such a rule is counterproductive. It may even harm the relationship.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d said Samantha Whiten, a clinical psychologist in Maryland. \u201cAll it does is make sure that people are fighting when they\u2019re tired.\u201d",
      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy tale, though.\u201d",
      "Some sources attribute the origin of the phrase to the New Testament book of Ephesians. Translations vary, but it\u2019s some version of: \u201cBe angry but do not sin; do not let the sun set on your anger.\u201d",
      "The trouble is, couples shouldn\u2019t fight when they are \u201cemotionally dysregulated,\u201d Whiten said. She referred to the acronym HALT, a common reminder in therapy that people should avoid serious discussions when hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Many people also drink alcohol at night, which doesn\u2019t help create a calm environment.",
      "\u201cThey are more likely to say and do things impulsively that they may regret,\u201d she said.",
      "Discussing problems at night might seem easiest because it's when your partner is most available, said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City.",
      "But it\u2019s better to acknowledge that something needs to be discussed, take a pause, and set a time to come back to it, she said. That could mean having lunch or coffee together the next day, or any time you\u2019re not rushing out the door.",
      "The key is to follow through.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to a skill, to trust that your partner is really going to return to this thing that\u2019s really important to you,\u201d Romanoff said, adding that most couples have to practice that.",

      "The reverse \u2014 avoidance \u2014 is no better. Many people might need space to process an argument, but they\u2019re obliged to come back later to their partner to address the topic.",
      "The goal is that both people feel secure enough to acknowledge the disagreement, remember their relationship is more important than one argument, and agree to talk about it later, Whiten said. \u201cWhen people can learn to do that, it\u2019s really transformative.\u201d",
      "Romanoff suggested that couples establish regular check-ins. They don\u2019t have to talk about the worst problems in their lives at a given point, but they should make a habit of small gestures of communication.",

      "When there is an issue, use \u201cI\u201d statements, be clear about what you need, and try to create a plan for how the other person can deliver, she said. A request posed at an appropriate time will often be better received.",

      "A nonprofit group in Miami is helping reduce the strain on emergency rooms by providing homeless people with health care where they live",
      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "\u201cA sort of bigger vision emerged to fill the gaps in the local social safety net,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

      "The Democratic-led Legislature sent a flurry of bills to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that include more than $16 million to sustain food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and additional funds to bolster food banks, as the federal government ends SNAP eligibility for many noncitizens and changes benefit calculations for others.",

      "Another $50 million would help sustain medical services at rural health clinics and hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid spending.",

      "At the same time, Democrats and some GOP legislators voted to backfill subsidies to health insurance on New Mexico\u2019s Affordable Health Care exchange in case federal credits are allowed to expire. The federal subsidies are a major sticking point of the budget standoff in Washington that prompted the federal government shutdown Wednesday.",
      "In a news release, Lujan Grisham said she'll sign the bills to protect families from being priced out of insurance and ensure health care services are provided in small communities.",
      "Many federal health care changes under Trump's big bill don\u2019t kick in until 2027 or later, and Democratic legislators in New Mexico acknowledged that their bills are only a temporary bandage.",
      "\u201cSome of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,\u201d said state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the spending bill. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking of, not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars of reduced Medicaid support to our state.\u201d",

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",

      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",

      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "But after a year away from the NFL, the 74-year-old Carroll chose to return to take on the challenge of turning around a Las Vegas Raiders franchise that has gone more than two decades since coming close to the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t about accomplishing things to say you were worthy,\u201d Carroll said at his introductory news conference in January. \u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do next that counts.\u201d",
      "That appears to be a common theme for Carroll and other coaches 70 years and older. They thrive on competition, and a leisurely retirement doesn't seem to be as appealing as drawing up game plans and developing athletes.",
      "Carroll is the only NFL coach in that age range, though Kansas City's Andy Reid, at 67, isn't far behind.",

      "Coaches aren't the only ones working later in life.",

      "\u201cPeople are staying healthier longer,\u201d Roszkowski said. \u201dWe know that continuing to work has a lot of health benefits. You're staying out of that social isolation. You're staying mobile with having a job. For most people, you're commuting or going into a place. You've moving around. You're continuing to use your brain.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s time to get a flu vaccine, and pediatricians are urging people to get them after last winter, when the U.S. saw the most flu-related child deaths in 15 years.",
      "October is the ideal month to get protected, experts say, because flu cases typically begin climbing in November.",
      "\u201cThe best time is today. If you haven\u2019t already had it, get it. I got mine yesterday,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",

      "Just about everyone age 6 months and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and major medical societies. Despite lots of recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven\u2019t changed.",
      "Flu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children, and people of any age who have chronic health problems including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.",
      "About 71% of seniors roll up their sleeves every year, but less than 50% of other adults do. Last year, just under half of children got a flu vaccine, down from over 60% a few years ago.",
      "Flu vaccines may not block all infections, but they do a really good job of preventing severe illness and hospitalization, said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Tens of thousands of Americans die from the flu every winter. But during last year\u2019s harsh season, the CDC counted 280 children who died of flu-related complications. Nearly half had no prior health problems and about 90% hadn't been fully vaccinated.",
      "Another concern from last season: The CDC counted more than 100 children who developed a rare flu complication \u2014 brain inflammation that can lead to seizures, hallucinations, or even death. Very few were vaccinated.",
      "It\u2019s important for mothers-to-be to understand that a bad case of flu can put them in the hospital or cause their baby to be born prematurely, Riley said.",

      "FluMist has been available for more than 20 years, but the at-home option is newly available for certain adults on the vaccine's website.

      "There was no immediate information on the nature of the family conflict that preceded the stabbing. Rautenberg declined to comment on a possible motive at a news conference in the nearby city of Hagen, saying that is still a matter for investigation.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Jasm\u00edn Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez looks out from a wooden boat at the water as she crosses a narrow channel that connects a labyrinth of chinampas, island farms that were built by the Aztecs thousands of years ago.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s close our eyes and ask our Mother Water for permission to sail in peace,\u201d she said as the boat moves slowly, in contrast to the frenetic traffic of Mexico City just a few miles away.",
      "Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez owns one of these island farms, first created with mud from the bottom of the lakes that once covered this area. When the boat arrives at her island, she proudly shows the corn and leafy greens she grows. Her ancestors owned chinampas, but she had to buy this one because women traditionally haven't inherited them.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother didn't get any land. Back then, most was left in the hands of men,\u201d she said. At her side, Cassandra Gardu\u00f1o listens attentively. She also didn't inherit the family chinampa.",
      "Today both are part of a small but growing group of women who have bought chinampas to cultivate sustainably in an effort to preserve an ecosystem that is increasingly threatened by urban development, mass tourism and water pollution.",

      "___",
      "Making their way in an area still dominated by men hasn't been easy. In the chinampas of the boroughs of Xochimilco and San Gregorio Atlapulco, hardly any women work the land.",
      "\u201cPeople believe that men are the (only) ones who have the physical abilities to work them,\u201d said Gardu\u00f1o. The mud stains her pale pink shirt, matching her boots. She knows her outfit gets funny looks from longtime male chinampa workers, but instead of getting upset, she finds it amusing.",
      "After years away, she returned to San Gregorio in 2021 to dedicate herself to chinampa farming. She had gone to college and then spent long periods in Ecuador working in conservation efforts to protect manta rays and sharks. Then one day she came back to San Gregorio and was struck by the degradation of her own land: the lower water levels of the canals, the increasing pollution, the abandoned chinampas.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I started to realize: 'You are part of this space. And part of your responsibility is to safeguard it,'\u201d she said.",
      "After saving for a year, she bought a chinampa \u2014 and was shocked to find it in such a bad state. A cleanup found pieces of armchairs, televisions and beer bottles. She worked to reopen canals that had been crammed with garbage and began planting crops.",
      "The distrust among the neighbors was palpable.",
      "\u201cThey said: 'Let\u2019s see, this girl has never been down to this place, nobody knows her. And she\u2019s already doing what she wants,'\u201d she recalled.",
      "But she knew much more than they thought.",
      "Gardu\u00f1o had learned a lot as a little girl who ran around her grandfather\u2019s chinampa \u2014\u201ca paradise\u201d full of flowers. She learned that the mud from the bottom of the canals is the best fertilizer because it contains the mineral-rich ashes from the volcanoes surrounding Mexico City. She learned that planting a variety of crops keeps frost from destroying one entire crop and that the flowers attract insects, so they don\u2019t eat the cabbage or kale.",
      "\u201cChinampas can have up to eight rotations per year, whereas in other systems you might have two or three,\u201d Gardu\u00f1o explained. That\u2019s why the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recognized chinampas as one of the most productive agricultural systems on the planet. Today her field is a melting pot of colors: pale green of broccoli to the vivid yellow of marigolds.",
      "Since 2016, she has been collaborating with Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, advising other farmers who want to stop using agrochemicals and recover these traditional practices that also help preserve the ecosystem.",

      "Kneeling next to a planting bed, Gardu\u00f1o suggests elevating it so it won\u2019t flood when it rains. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez takes note. She bought this chinampa three years ago and is now seeking to obtain the \u201cEtiqueta Chinampera,\u201d the sustainability tag given by the university to producers who, among other things, use mud as fertilizer instead of agrochemicals. With this label, their products can be sold at higher prices.",
      "There are 16 farmers who have obtained the label, four of them women, said Diana Laura V\u00e1zquez Mendoza, of the university's Institute of Biology, adding that the project encourages women to \u201ctake back their chinampas and produce.\u201d",
      "In the chinampas supported by the university, filters made from aquatic plants are installed to clean the water and prevent the passage of carp and tilapia. Introduced in Xochimilco in the 1980s, these invasive species became predators of the most distinguished inhabitants of this ecosystem: Mexico\u2019s salamander-like axolotl.",
      "Today, this amphibian is on the verge of extinction because of these invasive species and a combination of factors polluting the canals: the discharge of sewage from urban growth in the area, mass tourism and the use of agrochemicals in many chinampas.",
      "\u201cChinampas are an artificial agro-ecosystem that was created to supply food in pre-Hispanic times to the entire population. And that endures to this day,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cSo the way to conserve Xochimilco is to also conserve the chinampa.\u201d",
      "But a walk through the area on any given Sunday makes it clear that fewer chinampas are dedicated to agriculture. Every weekend, hundreds of people come here to play soccer on chinampas converted into fields or to drink aboard the brightly painted boats known as \u201ctrajineras.\"",
      "The impact of this transformation on the wetland is evident: contaminants have been found there, from heavy metals such as iron, cadmium and lead to oils, detergents and pesticides, according to a study by biologist Luis Boj\u00f3rquez Castro, of the Autonomous Metropolitan University. Most come from the treatment plants that discharge their water in Xochimilco and from the chinampas that use agrochemicals, according to Castro's study.",
      "\u201cLook at the clarity of the water,\u201d said Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez as she reaches into the canal where she has installed her biofilter. She knows that taking care of the water is essential to preserving this ecosystem.",
      "This wetland is the last remnant of what was once the great Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire built on the lakes that once filled the Valley of Mexico. Although today what remains of Xochimilco represents only 3% of the original extension of those lakes, it\u2019s still key to the stability of the city.",
      "If it were to disappear, the average temperature of the capital could rise by up to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), according to biologist Luis Zambrano. Xochimilco and San Gregorio also reduce flooding during the rainy season, provide a natural carbon dioxide reservoir and are home to hundreds of species, such as herons and the Tlaloc frog.",
      "\u201cLook at the red-headed birds in the lagoon!\u201d exclaimed Gardu\u00f1o, driving home at dusk along a dirt road after a long day at her chinampa.",
      "For her, this is still the paradise she roamed with her grandfather. She\u2019s convinced that women are needed to preserve chinampas and hopes that within 10 years, many more will own and take care of them.",
      "\u201cFrom the shared labor of women and men, we can do what we all want, which is conserve what we have left for as long as possible,\u201d she said.",

      "Milei\u2019s office said that he had instructed the Foreign Ministry and other officials \u201cto immediately take the administrative and diplomatic steps necessary\" to comply with a Supreme Court decision issued earlier Tuesday approving the extradition of the businessman, Fred Machado.",

      "JUBA, South Sudan -- JUBA, South Sudan (AP) \u2014 An international ceasefire monitor says parties to South Sudan 's faltering peace agreement have recruited new fighters and abducted children to participate in a conflict that observers have warned could widen again into civil war.",
      "Tuesday's statement in the capital, Juba, said South Sudan\u2019s military in June opened a recruitment drive for 4,000 forces for peacekeeping and other purposes and that it opened a new training center in August.",
      "The Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission, or RJMEC, is a ceasefire monitoring body overseen by a regional bloc known as IGAD.",
      "Its statement also said the body had received reports that all sides in the conflict have abducted or mobilized children to participate, and that combatants have engaged in sexual violence.",
      "The reports, also shared with the U.N. Security Council, are likely to fuel concern that South Sudan's government and opposition groups are preparing for a further escalation.",
      "Renewed fighting between South Sudan\u2019s army and opposition fighters loyal to Riek Machar \u2014 who faces a criminal trial after President Salva Kiir said he had suspended him as his deputy \u2014 have intensified since the end of 2024.",
      "That has raised concerns that the 2018 peace agreement ending the country\u2019s civil war is collapsing.",
      "That agreement also formed a transitional government intended to carry out elections once its provisions, like the integration of forces into a national army, were fulfilled. The transitional period has been extended twice, mostly recently in September 2024. International observers and analysts say many provisions remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cIf the current challenges are not urgently addressed there is a high risk of reversal of all the gains already made, and may cause a collapse of the agreement altogether,\u201d George Aggrey Owinow, the RJMEC\u2019s interim chairman, told Tuesday's meeting.",
      "The meeting was attended by senior members of South Sudan\u2019s government including military officials, as well as representatives of major opposition parties and most ambassadors present in the country.",
      "It was the first time the body had met since February after repeated meetings were cancelled, some due to security concerns.",

      "The Senate has confirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to fill a critical vacancy at the top agency for worker rights, restoring it to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement",
      "The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to fill a critical vacancy at the top agency for worker rights, restoring it to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement.",
      "The confirmation of Brittany Panuccio as a commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Tuesday established a Republican majority at the agency and restored the quorum needed to make major policy and enforcement decisions in pursuit of Trump's civil rights priorities, including stamping out diversity and inclusion programs and rolling back protections for transgender workers.",
      "The Senate voted 51-47 along party lines to confirm Panuccio and more than 100 other Trump nominees under rules adopted by Republicans to make it easier to confirm large groups of lower-level, non-judicial nominations.",
      "Leading Democratic senators have said they won\u2019t confirm Trump\u2019s nominees to the EEOC unless he reverses his unprecedented firing in January of two Democratic commissioners before their terms were up, saying the move stripped the agency of its historic bipartisanship and independence.",
      "Their dismissals removed a key obstacle to implementing Trump's civil rights agenda but also temporarily left the commission without the quorum required to bring some major lawsuits, revise regulations for implementing laws and take other decisions.",
      "Republican senators have welcomed the prospect that the EEOC will rescind certain policies on DEI, gender-identity and abortion that they argued overstepped the agency's authority.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who was confirmed to a second term as commissioner in July, has taken key steps to fulfill a slew of Trump's executive orders on civil rights.",
      "The EEOC has dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers and subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny. The agency also stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d an established concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out certain practices that disadvantage minorities, women, people with disabilities, older adults, and others. Lucas leveraged the EEOC to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",
      "The EEOC, which investigates employment discrimination in the private sector, was created by Congress under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The president appoints its five commissioners and the Senate confirms them, but their terms are meant to be staggered and overlap presidential terms.",
      "Panuccio was nominated to replace Republican Keith Sonderling, who left the EEOC in 2024 and is now deputy labor secretary. The EEOC now has three commissioners, including Democrat Kalpana Kotagal. Trump has yet to announce nominations for the two remaining vacancies. Meanwhile, one of the two Democratic commissioners he fired, Jocelyn Samuels, has filed a lawsuit demanding to be reinstated.",
      "At their Senate hearings, both Lucas and Panuccio vehemently maintained that the EEOC should not be considered an independency agency.",

      "Panuccio, who worked at the Department of Education during the first Trump administration, was most recently a Florida assistant U.S. attorney. During her hearing she said was passionate about defending women\u2019s rights and advocating for the rights of disabled workers, sharing her own past as a rape victim and a childhood diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.",
      "But during an exchange with Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Panuccio refused to rule out the possibility that the EEOC would obey a hypothetical order from Trump to stop investigating sex-based discrimination charges on behalf of women, answering that that \u201cthe EEOC as an executive branch agency does respond to the President as the head of the executive branch.\u201d",
      "While the EEOC has continued bringing lawsuits and settling complaints on behalf of women, Democrats and civil rights groups say the EEOC has set a dangerous precedent of halting investigations into entire categories of discrimination to comply with presidential orders.",
      "Panuccio\u2019s confirmation \u201ccements a Trump takeover of the EEOC that will mean the end of critical protections against workplace harassment and discrimination,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state said in a statement.",
      "With quorum reestablished, the EEOC is likely to revise its guidance on workplace harassment, which the agency updated last year for the first time in 25 years to strengthen protections for LGBTQ workers, including the right to use bathrooms and be addressed by pronouns consistent with their gender identity. A Texas federal judge struck down those provisions in May but the EEOC has been unable to formally rewrite the guidance without quorum.",
      "Another looming flashpoint involves EEOC regulations on the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a 2020 law that strengthened the rights of pregnant workers to receive accommodations such as time off for medical appointments. Republican-led states and religious groups have successfully challenged the EEOC regulations in court for including abortion as a pregnancy-related condition.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky's attorney general claimed Tuesday that the online gaming platform Roblox has become a \u201cplayground for predators\u201d as he announced a lawsuit accusing the company of lax child safety measures.",
      "The Kentucky suit, filed by his office Monday in a state court, is the latest action alleging that the wildly popular site isn\u2019t doing enough to protect children on its gaming services.",
      "To bolster safeguards for children and teenagers flocking to the site, the company needs to install effective age verifications and content filters, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said. Added parental notifications also are needed, he said.",
      "Courtney Norris, a Kentucky mother of three who joined Coleman at a news conference, said she mistakenly viewed Roblox as a safe online gaming choice for her children.",
      "\"I came to realize, later than I would like to admit, that it actually is the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of the internet, targeted at children,\u201d she said.",
      "The company is facing a growing backlash. The Kentucky suit comes after Louisiana sued the company in August. A suit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped.",
      "Roblox on Tuesday pushed back against the allegations.",
      "\u201cWe have rigorous safety measures in place from advanced AI models to an expertly trained team of thousands moderating our platform 24/7 for inappropriate content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \"No system is perfect and our work on safety is never done. We are constantly innovating our safety systems, including adding 100 new safeguards, such as facial age estimation, this year alone.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it has 111 million daily active users. The company said in an email Tuesday that it implements strict safety defaults for its youngest users. It said the platform's users under 13 cannot directly message others on Roblox, outside of games or experiences, and cannot directly message others during games or experiences unless the default setting is changed using parental controls.",
      "The company said it has rigorous text chat filters to block inappropriate words and phrases, attempts to direct under-13 users off the platform and the sharing of personal information such as phone number or address. It does not allow user-to-user image sharing and prohibits sexual conversations, it said.",
      "The Kentucky lawsuit gives a starkly different portrayal of the platform.",

      "Coleman, a Republican, said the site's \u201ccartoonish figures and experiences\u201d appeal to children, but he warned that \"underneath this cartoonish, innocent veneer is something sinister. The platform has become a playground for predators who seek to harm our children.\u201d",

      "Francine the calico cat is back home at a Lowe's store in Virginia after going missing for a few weeks, hitching a ride on a truck that turned up at a sister facility in another state.",
      "Two employees from a Lowe\u2019s in Richmond made the 90-minute drive early Monday to pick up Francine, who disappeared in September and recently was discovered at the company\u2019s distribution center in Garysburg, North Carolina.",
      "She was back on the job Tuesday, playing with customers, posing for photos and soaking in affection.",
      "\u201cFrancine is one of us,\" store supervisor Wayne Schneider said in a telephone interview. \"She\u2019s just amazing. What she means here to the store and the employees, you really can\u2019t imagine the outpouring that the employees and also the customers give her daily.\u201d",
      "Francine spends much of her time either at the customer service desk or in the store's seasonal area. But things went awry in September as the store brought in items for the upcoming Christmas season. Store general manager Mike Sida said that disruption may have prompted Francine to seek comfort elsewhere.",
      "After store employees hadn't seen Francine for a few days, they reviewed past surveillance video. There were glimpses of her in the appliance section and then the receiving department, where she darted into a truck. An overnight manager is then seen shutting the truck's door and off it went to Garysburg, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) to the south.",
      "\u201cAnd then, of course, when she got down to the distribution center, she shot off the truck,\u201d Sida said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we found out where she was and she was missing.\u201d",
      "An animal control office set up humane traps at the distribution center, where photos of Francine were posted throughout. The center had dozens of monitoring cameras, and Lowe\u2019s brought in thermal drones to survey the area. An Instagram account unaffiliated with Lowe's dedicated to finding Francine grew to more than 34,000 followers.",
      "On Saturday, Francine was spotted on camera near the distribution center. After more humane traps were installed, a volunteer checked each trap throughout the night. Finally, one of the traps triggered and Francine's meows could be heard.",
      "Schneider and Sida got in a car early Monday and drove to get Francine.",
      "\u201cThat ride going down, knowing that we were going to get her, was just heartwarming. Knowing she\u2019s safe and that she\u2019s coming back to the store to get off her two-week vacation,\u201d Schneider said.",

After reaching a new quota of 18.3 million tons of imports, additional imports will face a 50% tariff. This is double the current 25% rate \u2014 a high price akin to U.S. President Donald Trump's steel measures. Neighboring nations such as Norway, Iceland and Ukraine will be exempt.",

      "The spring 2026 season has wrapped up with Paris, showcasing bold trends that are set to influence global fashion",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 The spring fashion season ended with silhouettes you could spot from a block away.",
      "As Paris Fashion Week wrapped up this week after myriad debuts and shake-ups, three trends took hold. Shoulders were broadened and jackets snapped to attention. Skin showed on the wearer\u2019s terms. And dressy, formal fashion came back \u2014 lighter, simpler, and meant for real life, not just red carpets.",
      "Call it Paris \u2019 no-nonsense reply to a jittery year: clothes that square your shoulders, put you in charge of your body and add walk-in impact to any weekday at work.",
      "Because the French capital remains the ultimate fashion gateway and the city that closes the season, trends seen here will rapidly cascade to high streets in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and beyond.",
      "Celebrity isn\u2019t new to fashion \u2014 but its pull is growing, and this season it felt central once again.",
      "Meghan Markle at Balenciaga, Madonna gracing Saint Laurent, Kim Kardashian sweeping into Maison Margiela, Nicole Kidman front-row at Chanel.",
      "The star arrivals turned shows into broadcast moments before the first look. Designers responded accordingly.",
      "This week\u2019s shows underlined the impact of the digital age. Celebrity-driven fashion shows now reach a global audience online, so designs must look great both in person and on camera. The most successful looks are those that impress live and also stand out in quick, eye-catching clips.",
      "The first and loudest shift was power up top. Jackets broadened the shoulder and cleaned up the line.",
      "Saint Laurent set the mood in razor-shouldered black. Mugler revived the hourglass with no apology. Givenchy eased the padding but kept the authority. Celine offered the daily uniform in crisp blazers and trousers.",
      "Even Chanel \u2014 a house that can tilt ornate \u2014 lightened the suit and cropped the jacket so it moved. The message is simple: after seasons of slouch, tailoring is back.",

      "Sheer looks were finished, not flimsy. Givenchy\u2019s transparency read as strength. Dior\u2019s lace felt airy, not uptight. Saint Laurent\u2019s clingy layers made openness the point. Low waists returned with a steadier hand: McQueen brought back the low-rise line without the old shock factor.",
      "Even the \u201cproper\u201d houses joined in \u2014 Chanel nodded to underwear roots, and Herm\u00e8s traced equestrian lines into the city. The fight over where the waist sits is back, but the choice belongs to the wearer.",
      "Dressy, formal fashion came back \u2014 lighter, simpler, and built for real life, not just red carpets. Paris remembered how to do drama without dead weight.",
      "Balenciaga floated a clean, sculpted volume that photographed big but wore light. Valentino dialed back ornament and let color and cut carry the room. Westwood kept the riotous spirit but cut it to move. Louis Vuitton scaled grandeur to everyday life. The cape stepped off the costume rack and into daylight at Dior \u2014 easy to wear, easy to fit, instant drama.",
      "Feathers followed suit across houses \u2014 glamorous, yes, but designed to walk. Dress-up isn\u2019t dead. It just punched a time card.",
      "In Milan, Bottega Veneta\u2019s Louise Trotter turned the house\u2019s craft into motion, showcasing sleek intrecciato outerwear and shimmering knits that backed the season\u2019s bigger-shoulder, lighter-feel mood. And at Versace, new creative lead Dario Vitale brought the brand down from Olympus to everyday \u2014 sexy, a little undone, and cut to live in, not just pose.",
      "Craft met tech quietly, resulting in fabrics that looked richer but felt lighter. Bags got more practical. These pieces don\u2019t want a glass case, they want scuffs and repeat wears. From New York, Michael Kors pushed the same idea of ease for a warming world \u2014 travel-minded, desert-light layers that breathe and move instead of cling.",
      "Color spoke plainly, too. Black led \u2014 it framed the big shoulder and sharpened the new suiting \u2014 with bright exceptions used like highlighters rather than paint buckets. You\u2019ll see the dark stuff first on the street, then the jewel tones. And the American minimalism test applied: strip the extras and let the shape do the work \u2014 a Calvin Klein lesson that echoed across runways.",
      "If one caption fits the week, Rick Owens supplied it when he sent models wading through water and made a case for tenacity in uncomfortable times. Paris took him at his word.",
      "The best looks didn\u2019t chase viral moments; they did a job. A strong jacket that squares your posture. A sheer dress that doesn\u2019t blink. A cape that turns a commute into an entrance. Three trends, plain as day \u2014 big shoulders, real skin, and dress-up with a day job \u2014 and a fashion capital reminding everyone that bold and useful can be the same thing.",

      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \u201cdedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\u201d said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \u201cThis auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\u201d",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \u201cThe Best of Joy of Painting,\u201d based on Ross' show, \u201cAmerica's Test Kitchen,\u201d \u201cJulia Child's French Chef Classics\u201d and \u201cThis Old House.\u201d Small and rural stations are particularly challenged.",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.

      "The thirty paintings to be auctioned span Ross\u2019 career and include landscapes depicting serene mountain vistas and lake scenes, his signature aesthetic. He created most of the 30 on-air, each in under 30 minutes, which was the span of a single episode.",
      "Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750. The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) \u2014 As gold prices hover at record highs, a leading Catholic leader in Peru\u2019s Amazon is urging countries that are destinations for the precious metal to help stem illegal mining that is poisoning rivers with mercury.",
      "Miguel \u00c1ngel Cadenas, an Augustinian from Spain who has lived in Peru\u2019s Amazon for three decades, said illegal mining has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic, citing the Tigre, Nanay, Napo and Putumayo rivers as some areas where communities are at risk.",
      "Tests have found mercury levels in some fish above World Health Organization limits, and hair samples from local residents analyzed by scientists and doctors also showed elevated concentrations.",
      "\u201cWe are in a delicate situation,\u201d Cadenas told The Associated Press. \u201cGiven that the Amazonian diet is rich in fish, we are talking about food insecurity.\u201d",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during small-scale mining. It contaminates water, accumulates in fish, and builds up in people\u2019s bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Cadenas said the health risks are especially acute in the Amazon, where medical services are scarce.",
      "Research in Peru\u2019s Madre de Dios region found that 43% of women of childbearing age had mercury levels above WHO safety limits, while hair samples in villages along Peru\u2019s Amazon riverways showed nearly 80% of residents exceeded the threshold.",
      "\u201cThe majority of people do not understand what is happening. There is barely any information,\u201d Cadenas said. \u201cThe state should first provide good information to its own population and then sources of food that allow other alternatives \u2014 which do not exist.\u201d",
      "Gold prices are soaring \u2014 analysts expect them to average around $3,675 per ounce by late 2025 with possible gains toward $4,000 by 2026, according to JPMorgan.",
      "Analysts say weak traceability systems make it easier for illegally mined gold to slip into global markets. Reports from Switzerland and sustainability researchers focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards say gold tainted with mercury in places like the Amazon is often laundered through refineries before entering jewelry, electronics or national reserves.",
      "Cadenas, who served as a missionary and bishop before being appointed in 2021 to lead the Apostolic Vicariate of Iquitos, stressed that Peru cannot handle the problem alone.",
      "\u201cAs long as the price of gold continues to rise, it is very difficult for a national government to manage this situation,\u201d he said. He pointed to gold-buying nations including China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.",
      "\u201cThe first responsibility should be that those countries buying gold require traceability, so that it is not possible to pass illegal gold into legality so easily,\u201d he said.",

      "Peru has at times tried to rein in illegal mining and mercury use. In 2019 it launched Operation Mercury, a military-police crackdown that sharply reduced deforestation in the La Pampa mining zone, though much of the activity later shifted elsewhere. Authorities also announced record seizures of contraband mercury, including a four-ton shipment at Callao port this year.",
      "Still, Indigenous groups say enforcement is inconsistent, and regional governments across the Amazon warn that cross-border smuggling of mercury continues to fuel illegal mining.",
      "The city of Iquitos hosted the Amazon Water Summit last week, which the vicariate helped organize. Roughly 400 people from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil took part in 14 workshops on topics including water and extractivism, climate change and education.",
      "Cadenas noted that Loreto, Peru\u2019s largest Amazonian department, has the country\u2019s lowest access to drinking water \u2014 with about 60% of the population lacking potable water and sanitation. Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled two years ago that this amounted to an \u201cunconstitutional state of affairs,\u201d but he said the judgment has yet to be fulfilled.",

      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of the recent economic turmoil has spanned from Trump\u2019s trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and weakening the job market. As a result, hiring has plunged while inflation continues to inch back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The current U.S. government shutdown has added to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. Trump has also threatened to use the shutdown to dole out mass firings and perhaps permanently shutter offices in attempt to punish Democrats for voting down GOP legislation.",
      "The scope of impact could come down to how long the impasse lasts. Wall Street, meanwhile, has largely been unmoved by the shutdown so far \u2014 but Treasury yields dropped after discouraging hiring data from ADP Research Wednesday.",

      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn\u2019t always the inflation hedge many say it is \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.\u201d",
      "And even gold\u2019s current rally has seen some volatility. While still up significantly overall since the start of the year, there\u2019s been a handful of short stretches with losses. Gold prices fell for several days following Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement on April 2, for example.",
      "If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission says, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.",

      "Fico announced the multi-billion-dollar deal during a speech at an annual nuclear conference in the Slovak capital. He said that the new reactor will be built at the existing nuclear plant in Jaslovsk\u00e9 Bohunice in western Slovakia, will have an output of over 1,000 megawatts and be fully owned by the state.",
      "It was unclear when the two governments will sign the deal.",
      "Fico didn\u2019t gave more details but his government had approved a plan last year for a 1,200-megawatt nuclear unit at the site where the dominant utility Slovensk\u00e9 Elektr\u00e1rn\u011b (Slovak power plants) currently operates two nuclear units. The cost of the project was estimated to reach up to 15 billion euros ($17.5 billion).",

      "Trump\u2019s talk of making Canada the 51st state and his tariffs have Canadians feeling an undeniable sense of betrayal. Relations with Canada\u2019s southern neighbor and longtime ally haven\u2019t been worse.",
      "\u201cWe've had ups and downs, but this is the lowest point in relations that I can recall,\u201d said Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States and current deputy chairman of TD Bank.",
      "\u201cCanadians aren't being instructed what to do; they are simply voting with their feet,\" he said. \"I talk every day to ordinary citizens who are changing their vacation plans, and I talk to large business owners who are moving reward trips away or executive business trips. There is an outright rebellion.\"",
      "There is fear in Canada over what will happen to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Carney is looking to get some relief on some sector-specific tariffs, but expectations are low.",
      "\u201cImproving relations with the White House ahead of the USMCA review is certainly an objective of the trip, but opposition parties and part of the Canadian public will criticize Prime Minister Carney if he doesn\u2019t achieve some progress on the tariff front at this stage,\u201d said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",

Carney has said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs. He said the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods is 5.6% and remains the lowest among all its trading partners.",

      "The ties between the two countries are without parallel. About $2.5 billion (nearly $3.6 billion Canadian) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.",

      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

      "The point of the 2017 game was to highlight inequality in sports for women and girls. On that front, Youngson achieved her goal with the match becoming the subject of a documentary and landing the group in the Guinness Book of World Records.",
      "Still, something bothered Youngson as the match unfolded. Glancing at the athletes' feet, she was struck that all the women were wearing men's or boy's soccer cleats instead of gear that was designed specifically for them. The realization led her to launch IDA Sports, which makes soccer cleats for the unique athletic needs of women.",
      "\u201cThere was this real commercial gap for performance footwear for women,\u201d said Youngson, whose IDA cleats are worn by players including Washington Spirit midfielder Courtney Brown. \"As the game is growing, we\u2019re in this moment when everything\u2019s professionalizing, but the footwear wasn\u2019t really keeping pace, so I wanted to go and change that.\u201d",

National Women\u2019s Soccer League teams are worth 29% more this year than they were a year ago, with both Angel City and the Kansas City Current now valued at over $250 million. Several new pro sports leagues have formed in recent years, including the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League and the 3-on-3 Unrivaled basketball league. The Women\u2019s Professional Baseball League is set to launch next year.",
      "Overall, women's sports generated global revenue of $1.88 billion in 2024 and is projected to rake in $2.35 billion this year, according to consulting firm Deloitte. Commercial revenue, including s ponsorships and merchandising sales, surpassed $1 billion globally for the first time last year.",
      "All that growth means more opportunities for women-owned brands \u2014 and a chance to reject the \u201cshrink it and pink it\u201d mentality in which companies were criticized for taking men's products and selling them to women by making them pretty rather than functional.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says the government shutdown is putting more stress on air traffic controllers who already have an extremely stressful job, as well as threatening a program that small communities rely on to help subsidize airline se...",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday that the government shutdown is putting more stress on air traffic controllers who already have an extremely stressful job, as well as threatening a program that small communities rely on to help subsidize airline service.",
      "Controllers are expected to continue working without a paycheck, Duffy said, so they are now worried about how to pay their bills in addition to worrying about keeping flights safe. And there have started to be instances of controllers calling out sick, leading to delays at several airports Monday.",
      "\u201cNow what they think about as they\u2019re controlling our airspace is, how am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home. How do I put food on the table? I\u2019m working six days a week. Do I have to take a second job and drive Uber when I\u2019m already exhausted from doing a job that\u2019s already stressful to think about how I can make extra money because the government may not provide me a paycheck?\u201d Duffy said.",
      "Travelers at Newark Liberty International Airport, where Duffy held his news conference, said controllers should be paid for their work.",
      "\u201cEveryone should get paid for what they are doing. Of course it bothers me,\u201d said Daniel Johansson from North Carolina.",
      "A traveler from Utah, Nancy Taylor, agreed.",
      "\u201cYeah, that would be hard to work for no pay,\" Taylor said. \"But I think they understand the importance of their job. And the safety that provides to us as travelers. They need to get paid.\u201d",
      "The Transportation Department has been able to keep the air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City open for now with funding from previous years, but Duffy is still concerned about the potential impact on efforts to hire and train new controllers in the hope of eliminating a longstanding shortage. Duffy said the support staff who train controllers after they come out of the academy could be laid off.",
      "The head of the air traffic controllers union, Nick Daniels, stayed away from political comments, but he urged Congress to end the shutdown.",

      "\u201cWe need to bring this shutdown to a close, so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction behind us, and completely focus on their vital work,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "Duffy said there has already been a small uptick in controllers calling out sick in a few places. Anytime that gets worse and creates a shortage of controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure controllers aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that creates delays and possibly cancellations. Near the end of the 35-day shutdown during the first Trump administration, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",
      "By Monday evening, the FAA was reporting that staffing shortages were creating delays in the Burbank, Newark and Denver airports. The worst problems were in Burbank, where California Gov. Gavin Newsom said no controllers were on duty during the evening, leading to average delays of two-and-a-half hours at that airport.",
      "The Essential Air Service program that subsidizes airline service to small communities across the country will also quickly run out of money. Duffy said that program enjoys strong bipartisan support and provides an important lifeline to many small communities. It is especially important in Alaska, where flying is the only way to travel between many communities.",
      "\u201cThat money runs out this Sunday. So there\u2019s many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their community,\u201d Duffy said.",

The reality is that for that to happen, there have to be reporting mechanisms in place and there has to be good technology that allows people who want to report anonymously to do so.\u201d",
      "Chadwick said the ability to report anonymously is especially important for colleges, where coaches, for decades, felt reluctant to publicly out rivals for cheating lest the rivals retaliate by turning the microscope on them.",
      "Created out of the lawsuit settlement, the CSC analyzes information about third-party NIL deals worth $600 or more that are submitted through an app called NIL Go, which was developed by Deloitte. Last month, it said it had approved nearly 6,100 deals worth about $35.4 million.",
      "Some school administrators and people running collectives have complained about delays in processing some of the deals.",
      "\u201cReview remains slow,\u201d Kansas State cap management and revenue sharing executive Julie Owen recently told AP, in feedback similar to that from others around the country. \"The functionality of the NIL Go website is less than ideal. It makes administrators\u2019 jobs more difficult, and providing additional information is far too complicated for student-athletes. These two should be distinguished, as CSC is not responsible for the operational side of NIL Go, which was created and operated by Deloitte.\u201d",
      "Seeley said NIL Go receives a high volume of admissions \u201cand the vast majority are getting cleared, and they're getting cleared expeditiously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are some deals that are submitted to NIL Go, certainly a minority of deals, that are problematic,\u201d Seeley said. \u201cThey either have errors in data entry, or indicators of (forbidden) pay for play. There is heightened review of those deals and heightened review takes time. That is not a bug in the system. That's a feature of the system.\u201d",

      "The Bucs improved to 4-1 on Sunday when Chase McLaughlin kicked a 39-yard field goal as time expired for a 38-35 win over Seattle.

Mayfield went 29 for 33 for 379 yards, two TDs and no interceptions in the 38-35 win for the Bucs. Darnold nearly matched him by going 28 for 34 for 341 yards, four TDs and an interception.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Scientists Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their development of metal\u2013organic frameworks \u2014 which an expert likened to Hermione Granger\u2019s enchanted handbag in the fictional \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series \u2014 that could play a part in solving some of humanity\u2019s greatest challenges.",
      "From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.",
      "The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione\u2019s famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramstr\u00f6m, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.",
      "The chemists worked separately but added to each other\u2019s breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.",
      "\u201cMetal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,\u201d Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.",
      "The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d from water.",
      "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d",
      "Hans Ellegren, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, announced Wednesday's prize in Stockholm. It was the third prize announced this week.",
      "Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia, Kitagawa, 74, with Japan\u2019s Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "Kitagawa spoke to the committee, and the press, over the phone Wednesday after his win was announced.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply honored and delighted that my long-standing research has been recognized,\" he said.",

      "\u201cInvestors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,\u201d said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.\u201d",
      "Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.",
      "Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new \u201cstandard\u201d models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.",

      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "The football video support (FVS) is a \u201csimplified version\u201d of VAR and has transformed the youth tournament into a testing ground for new technologies.",
      "Cards that vary between blue and purple are held by coaches, who are in charge of requesting reviews.",
      "During the group stage, its use has proven crucial, defining the course of several matches played in the cities of Santiago, Valpara\u00edso, Rancagua and Talca. The system was deployed in more than a dozen matches in the early part of the tournament.",
      "FVS was first used when South Korea coach Lee Chang-Won used a card for the first time during the opening match against Ukraine. He challenged a penalty, but the request was ultimately ruled out by the referee.",

      "Mexico's use of the system helped it overturn a penalty decision in a match they ended up tying 2-2 against Spain. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso Gonz\u00e1lez being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim.",
      "Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance.",
      "According to world soccer's ruling body FIFA, the FVS system aims to \u201cdemocratize football by introducing video review technology as a complementary option,\u201d not only for top-level competitions but also for those that \u201ccould not afford VAR infrastructure,\u201d thanks to its low cost and simplified operation.",

      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",

      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",

      "Minnesota regulators have approved the takeover of Minnesota Power by an investment group, despite opposition from the state attorney general and consumer advocates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates.",
      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",
      "The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.",
      "Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power\u2019s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner.",
      "Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S.",
      "Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power\u2019s operations, strategy and values wouldn\u2019t change under BlackRock and that the deal\u2019s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest.",
      "The commission's chair, Katie Sieben, agreed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we\u2019ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,\u201d Sieben said.",

      "Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group\u2019s \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2014 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with \u201ca high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,\u201d and \u201cassumed the absolute worst in these investors.\u201d But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.",
      "Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.",
      "\u201cPrivate equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,\" Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement.

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

If companies start making more money, they are either going to increase the dividend or invest in new areas. Hopefully, the majority will invest in new areas to create new jobs.",
      "You will see successful companies expand and grow dramatically, but you are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear. They won\u2019t have the skills to adjust to this new innovation economy driven by AI because they were trained in silos they were trained to move at the speed of a five-year cycle as opposed to a 12-month cycle.",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

      "In the wake of Jane Goodall's death, the many scientists and others influenced by her are promising to do their best to carry on her legacy",
      "In her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity's understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet \u2014 chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.",
      "Her death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall\u2019s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.",
      "\u201cJane Goodall is an icon \u2013 because she was the start of so much,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.",
      "She recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. \u201cI wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "What is left now that Goodall is gone is her unending hope, perhaps her greatest legacy.",
      "\u201cShe believed hope was not simply a feeling, but a tool,\u201d Rhett Butler, founder of the nonprofit conservation-news site Mongabay, wrote in his Substack newsletter. \u201cHope, she would tell me, creates agency.\u201d",
      "Goodall\u2019s legacy and life\u2019s work will continue through her family, scientists, her institute and legions of young people around the globe who are working to bridge conservation and humanitarian needs in their own communities, her longtime assistant said Thursday.",
      "That includes Goodall\u2019s son and three grandchildren, who are an important part of the work of the Jane Goodall Institute and in their own endeavors, said Mary Lewis, a vice president at the institute who began working with the famed primatologist in 1990.",
      "Goodall\u2019s son, Hugo van Lawick, works on sustainable housing. He is currently in Rwanda. Grandson Merlin and granddaughter Angelo work with the institute, while grandson Nick is a photographer and filmmaker, Lewis said. \u201cShe has her own family legacy as well as the legacy through her institutes around the world,\u201d said Lewis.",
      "In addition to her famed research center in Tanzania and chimpanzee sanctuaries in other countries, including the Republic of Congo and South Africa, a new cultural center is expected to open in Tanzania late next year. There also are Jane Goodall Institutes in 26 countries, and communities are leading conservation projects in several countries, including an effort in Senegal to save critically endangered Western chimpanzees.",
      "But it is the institute\u2019s youth-led education program called Roots & Shoots that Goodall regarded as her enduring legacy because it is \u201cempowering new generations,\u201d Lewis said.",

      "They harvest in the Alentejo region, sometimes called the \u201cTuscany of Portugal\u201d for its rolling vineyards, olive groves and forests that supply cork for the wines. In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",
      "\u201cToday, we can say they actually prefer this schedule, as they can often work almost another day, enjoy the day, and avoid the extreme heat we often experience here,\u201d she said.",
      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",
      "In Portugal's Alentejo region, daytime temperatures particularly in August can reach 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). At night, they can drop by as much as 20 C (36 F) or more.",
      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines. Intense heat also speeds up acid loss and can trigger early fermentation as wild yeasts and bacteria become more active.",
      "By harvesting at night, vintners can lock in more vibrant flavors that improve the quality of the wine produced.",
      "\u201cClimate change has greatly influenced our harvest and the process and we\u2019ve adapted over the years,\" Monteiro said.",

      "About 350 hikers had reached a meeting point in Tingri country and rescuers were in contact with another 200, state broadcaster CCTV said late Sunday. There was no immediate update on rescue efforts on Monday.",
      "The hikers were trapped at an elevation of more than 4,900 meters (16,000 feet), according to an earlier report from Jimu News, a Chinese online site. Mount Everest is about 8,850 meters (29,000 feet) tall.",
      "A hiker who rushed to descend before snow blocked the way told Jimu News that others still on the mountain told him the snow was 1 meter (3 feet) deep and had crushed tents.",
      "Hundreds of rescuers headed up the mountain Sunday to clear paths so that trapped people could come down, the Jimu report said. A video shot by a villager showed a long line of people with horses and oxen moving up a winding path in the snow.",
      "The snowstorm struck during a weeklong national holiday in China, when many travel at home and abroad.",
      "In another mountainous region in western China, one hiker died of hypothermia and altitude sickness and 137 others were evacuated in the north part of Qinghai province, CCTV said Monday.",

    "story": [
      "The new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas spells trouble for rural parts of the U.S. that rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 When Rob Coverdale started his job in 2023 as superintendent of the K-12 Crow Creek Tribal School in South Dakota, there were 15 unfilled teaching positions.",
      "Within nine months, he had filled those vacancies with Filipino teachers, the majority of whom arrived on the H-1B, a visa for skilled workers in specialty occupations.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve hired the H-1B teachers because we quite simply didn\u2019t have other applicants for those positions,\" Coverdale said. \u201cSo they're certainly not taking jobs from Americans. They're filling jobs that otherwise just simply we would not get filled.\u201d",
      "Now a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications spells trouble for those like Coverdale in rural parts of the country who rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions like education and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced the fee on Sept. 19, arguing that employers were replacing American workers with cheaper talent from overseas. Since then, the White House has said the fee won't apply to existing visa holders and offered a form to request exemptions from the charge.",
      "H-1Bs are primarily associated with tech workers from India. Big tech companies are the biggest user of the visa, and nearly three-quarters of those approved are from India. But there are critical workers, like teachers and doctors, who fall outside that category.",
      "Over the last decade, the U.S. has faced a shortage in those and other sectors. One in eight public school positions are vacant or filled by uncertified teachers, and the American Medical Association projects a shortage of 87,000 physicians in the next decade. The shortages are often worse in small, rural communities that struggle to fill jobs due to lower wages and often lack basic necessities like shopping and home rental options.",
      "H-1B and J-1 visas provide communities an option to hire immigrants with advanced training and certification. The J-1s are short-term visas for cultural exchange programs that aren't subject to the new fee but, unlike the H-1B, don't offer a pathway to permanent residency.",
      "While large companies may be able to absorb the new fee, that's not an option for most rural communities, said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association.",
      "\u201cIt really is potentially the cost of the salary and benefits of one teacher, maybe even two, depending on the state,\u201d she said. \u201cAttaching that price tag to a single hire, it just simply puts that position out of reach for rural budgets.\u201d",
      "A coalition of health care providers, religious groups and educators filed a lawsuit on Friday to stop the H-1B fee, saying it would harm hospitals, churches, schools and industries that rely on the visa. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment and referred a query to its website.",
      "Coverdale said spots like Stephan, where Crow Creek is based, struggle to attract workers in part because of their isolation. Stephan is nearly an hour's drive from the nearest Walmart or any place that sells clothes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe more remote you are, the more challenging it is for your staff members to get to your school and serve your kids,\u201d he said.",
      "Among Coverdale's hires is Mary Joy Ponce-Torres, who had 24 years of teaching experience in the Philippines and now teaches history at Crow Creek. It was a cultural adjustment, but Ponce-Torres said she's made friends and Stephan is now a second home.",
      "\u201cI came from a private school,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came here, I saw it was more like a rural area ... but maybe I was also looking for the same vibe, the same atmosphere where I can just take my time, take things in a much slower pace.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants like Ponce-Torres leave their family behind to pursue the experience and higher wages that a U.S. job can provide.",

      "Though schools can also use J-1 visas to bring in immigrant teachers, it increases turnover because it is shorter term.",

It is super important, in my opinion, to actually transition from the J-1 visas to the H-1B.\u201d",
      "Without enough staff, schools may hire uncertified teachers, combine classes, increase caseloads for special education managers or drop some course offerings. Shipley said any future shortage of teachers in Bison would force some classes to move online.",
      "The rural reliance on immigrant teachers is concentrated on harder-to-fill specialties, Sadorf said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to find a high school advanced math teacher that\u2019s qualified than it is to fill a second or third grade elementary class position,\u201d she said.",
      "The fee could be a \u201chuge problem\u201d for health care, said Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association and a doctor in Flint, Michigan. Without enough doctors, patients will have to drive farther and wait longer for care.",
      "One-quarter of the nation's physicians are international medical graduates, according to the AMA.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be terrible for the physician shortage, particularly in rural areas,\u201d said Mukkamala, whose parents came to the U.S. as international medical graduates. \u201cThe people that do graduate from here, who want to practice medicine, obviously have a choice and they\u2019re going to pick Detroit, they\u2019re going to pick Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco. ... This is kind of where everybody goes.\u201d",
      "Leading medical societies have called on the Trump administration and lawmakers to grant exemptions from the fee to immigrant health care workers.",
      "\u201cGiven the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\u201d the American Hospital Association said in a statement.",
      "Allison Roberts, vice president of human resources at Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in Watertown, South Dakota, said the change could be dire for health care in rural America.",
      "\u201cIf we end up not being exempt, the variation between what it is now and that $100,000 fee is going to really take your smaller, rural health care institutions out of the picture,\u201d she said.",

      "The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military\u2019s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.",

      "A down-ballot race for New Orleans clerk of criminal court has turned personal and contentious, as candidate Calvin Duncan faces attacks over whether he was truly exonerated for murder",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A down-ballot race for New Orleans clerk of criminal court has turned personal and contentious, as candidate Calvin Duncan, who spent three decades in prison before his conviction was vacated, faces attacks from Louisiana\u2019s attorney general and the incumbent clerk over whether he was truly exonerated.",
      "Duncan, 62, taught himself law while in prison and struggled for years access his records. He says that makes his quest to be the city\u2019s chief criminal recordkeeper personal.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t never want to have what happened to me happen to nobody else,\u201d said Duncan, whose murder conviction was vacated by a judge in 2021. He's listed in the National Registry of Exonerations alongside figures like \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d member Yousef Salaam, now a New York City councilmember.",
      "But Duncan's campaign has been overshadowed by disputes about the word \u201cexoneration\u201d in his case, injecting drama into the final stretch of an otherwise sleepy municipal race. Voters head to the polls Saturday.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and incumbent clerk Darren Lombard have both denied Duncan\u2019s innocence, pointing to a 2011 plea deal for manslaughter and armed robbery that Duncan says he accepted only to secure his release. In televised debates, media interviews and campaign advertisements, Lombard has called Duncan a murderer.",
      "Duncan, a Democrat, accuses his opponents of trying to mislead voters. Duncan's supporters say it's an example of bare-knuckle politics in New Orleans, where more than 10 candidates are also running to replace term-limited Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who pleaded not guilty in September to corruption charges.",
      "Jessica Paredes, executive director of the exoneration registry, said there should be no doubt that Duncan's case deserves to be listed among the more than 3,700 exonerations tracked since 1989.",
      "\u201cWe err conservatively to maintain the integrity of the database,\u201d she said. \u201cCalvin\u2019s exoneration was not one of these close calls. His case clearly meets our inclusion criteria.\u201d",
      "Duncan presented new evidence of his innocence in a 1981 fatal shooting \u2014 including that police officers had lied in court \u2014 prior to his release from prison. A judge later vacated Duncan\u2019s conviction under a legal statute of \u201cfactual innocence\u201d and prosecutors dismissed the charges.",
      "Legal scholars say there is no across-the-board legal standard for exoneration, but Paredes' group generally defines it as occurring \u201cwhen a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared after new evidence of innocence becomes available.\u201d",
      "Even before Duncan ran for office, his case drew scrutiny from Murrill, the state's Republican attorney general. After Duncan earned a law degree in 2023 and sought to obtain $330,000 in state compensation for his wrongful conviction, Murrill threatened to contest his ability to practice law unless he dropped his claim for the money, according to Jacob Weixler, Duncan\u2019s attorney.",

      "Less than two weeks before the election, Murrill escalated the dispute, releasing a public letter accusing Duncan of \u201cgross misrepresentation\" for calling himself exonerated. On Monday, dozens of attorneys in Louisiana signed a letter rejecting her claims.",
      "In the legal community, Duncan had already achieved a degree of celebrity before running for office.",
      "He recalls in his memoir how an older inmate advised him to learn the law to save himself. With only an eighth-grade education, Duncan honed his legal skills and was allowed to help other inmates prepare court documents as part of a prison legal program.",

Duncan was the driving force behind a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended non-unanimous jury convictions in Louisiana and Oregon, the only two states still allowing a practice rooted in the Jim Crow era, said G. Ben Cohen, an attorney in the case.",

The New Orleans criminal court system still leans heavily on paper records, and thousands of files were lost during Hurricane Katrina. In August, troves of criminal court records were mistakenly thrown away, requiring the clerk's office to salvage them from a landfill.",

      "The federal judge overseeing the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of former FBI director James Comey has already handled cases in President Donald Trump\u2019s orbit",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) \u2014 Michael Nachmanoff has built a quiet reputation in the federal courthouse in northern Virginia \u2014 a onetime public defender turned judge known for methodical preparation and a cool temperament. On Wednesday, he\u2019ll find himself at the center of a political storm: presiding over the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of former FBI director James Comey.",
      "Confirmed to the bench by President Joe Biden in 2021, Nachmanoff was randomly assigned to the case after a Virginia grand jury indicted Comey last month on charges including obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The assignment instantly drew Donald Trump\u2019s attention. The president, long fixated on Comey, blasted him as a \u201cDirty Cop\u201d and derided Nachmanoff as a \u201cCrooked Joe Biden appointed Judge\u201d while celebrating the charges as \u201cJUSTICE FOR AMERICA!\u201d",
      "Despite the political noise, lawyers who know Nachmanoff say he is unlikely to be swayed.",
      "\u201cWhatever his personal politics are, I do not think that they will enter the courtroom,\u201d said longtime Virginia defense attorney Nina Ginsberg, who has tried cases before him. \u201cHe\u2019s confident enough in his ability to judge fairly that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be influenced by politics or the media coverage.\u201d",
      "Nachmanoff, 57, came to the bench after more than a decade as the Eastern District of Virginia\u2019s top federal public defender, where he argued and won a Supreme Court case that helped reduce racial disparities in crack cocaine sentencing. He served six years as a magistrate judge, handling some politically tinged cases. In 2019 he oversaw the first appearances of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, releasing them on $1 million bonds. More recently, he refused to block the CIA from firing Dr. Terry Adirim, a Pentagon physician targeted by Trump allies over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.",
      "\u201cHe was an aggressive advocate, the kind of lawyer who left no stones unturned,\u201d Ginsberg said of the judge. She said he conducts his courtroom in an even-handed, respectful manner.",
      "Timothy Belevetz, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, said Nachmanoff was \u201calways a worthy adversary.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been around the courthouse for years and years and years,\u201d Belevetz said. \u201cHe\u2019s very well-respected. He\u2019s very smart, he\u2019ll give parties a fair shake, he listens to the arguments.\u201d",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is set to make his first court appearance Wednesday in a Justice Department criminal case accusing him of having lied to Congress five years ago.",
      "The arraignment is expected to be brief, but the moment is nonetheless loaded with historical significance given that the case has amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being weaponized in pursuit of President Donald Trump's political enemies and operating at the behest of a White House determined to seek retribution.",
      "Comey is expected to plead not guilty at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, kickstarting a process of legal wrangling in which defense lawyers will almost certainly move to get the indictment dismissed before trial, possibly by arguing that the case amounts to a selective or vindictive prosecution.",
      "The indictment two weeks ago followed an extraordinary chain of events that saw Trump publicly implore Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and other perceived adversaries. The president also replaced the veteran attorney who had been overseeing the investigation with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor. Halligan rushed to file charges before a legal deadline lapsed despite warnings from other lawyers in the office that the evidence was insufficient for an indictment.",
      "The two-count indictment alleges that Comey made a false statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020, by denying he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source to the news media, and that he obstructed a congressional proceeding. Comey has denied any wrongdoing and has said he was looking forward to a trial. The indictment does not identify the associate or say what information may have been discussed with the media, making it challenging to assess the strength of the evidence or to even fully parse the allegations.",
      "Though an indictment is typically just the start of a protracted court process, the Justice Department has trumpeted the development itself as something of a win, regardless of the outcome. Trump administration officials are likely to point to any conviction as proof the case was well-justified, but an acquittal or even dismissal may also be held up as further support for their long-running contention that the criminal justice system is stacked against them.",
      "The judge randomly assigned to the case, Michael Nachmanoff, is a Biden administration appointee and former chief federal defender. Known for methodical preparation and a cool temperament, the judge and his background have already drawn the president's attention, with Trump deriding him as a \u201cCrooked Joe Biden appointed Judge.\u201d",

Trump also asked Comey to publicly reveal that Trump himself was not under investigation as part of the broader inquiry into Russian election interference, something Comey opted not to do.",

      "Crews are working with dredges, trucks and pipelines along the 35-mile (56-kilometer) stretch of beach in Pinellas County that includes cities such as Clearwater Beach, Indian Rocks Beach, Belleair Beach and Redington Beach. It's a prime tourist destination that is still recovering from hurricanes Helene, Milton and Debby.",
      "Helene was the most destructive for the beach towns, even though it made landfall far to the north. Twelve people died in Pinellas County because of strong storm surge that reached 8 feet (2.4 meters) high in some places.",
      "In past years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers played a major role in beach restoration, but not this time. The Corps wants private landowners to sign up for permanent easements that would allow government access in perpetuity \u2014 a change that has met with stiff resistance.",
      "So Pinellas County is doing the beach restoration itself, spending more than $125 million in tourism tax revenue to cover the costs. The county also has an easement program, but because some property owners won't sign up, there will be gaps in the beach renourishment that could lead to damage in future storms.",
      "\u201cWe can't do it as well as we could,\u201d said Barry Burton, the Pinellas County administrator. \u201cOur desire is to place sand across as much of the beach as we can.\u201d",
      "The project calls for using 2.5 million cubic yards (1.9 million cubic meters) of sand that's being dredged and pumped from offshore. In places where property owners refused to sign the easements, new sand is being placed toward the Gulf side of the beach, which is public. The beaches are being widened by as much as 100 feet (30 meters).",
      "For its part, the Army Corps said it can't justify spending millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars on beach renourishment without permanent easements to allow access.",

      "California is the third U.S. state to designate Diwali as an official statewide holiday",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 California has become the third U.S. state to designate Diwali \u2014 the Hindu \u201cFestival of Lights\u201d \u2014 as an official statewide holiday.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law Tuesday to go into effect on Jan. 1. It would authorize public schools and community colleges to close on Diwali. State employees could elect to take the day off and public school students will get an excused absence to celebrate the holiday. The new law recognizes that Diwali is also celebrated by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists.",
      "Pennsylvania was the first U.S. state to make Diwali a statewide holiday in 2024, followed by Connecticut earlier this year.",
      "Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a Democrat from San Jose who coauthored the bill with Darshana Patel, an assemblymember from San Diego, said he grew up celebrating the festival with family members, but it was an experience that was isolated from the rest of his life.",
      "\u201cTo have South Asian children be able to proudly celebrate and share it with others is a significant moment,\u201d he said.",
      "San Jose, a city in California's Silicon Valley, has a sizable Indian American population. According to a 2025 Pew survey, 960,000 out of the nation's Indian population of 4.9 million \u2014 or 20% \u2014 live in California. Hindu American organizations, including the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus in North America, advocated for the law.",
      "\u201cThe provisions that allow students to take the day off without repercussion and state employees to take paid leave are important leaps toward making Diwali truly accessible to those who celebrate,\u201d said Samir Kalra, managing director of the Hindu American Foundation.",
      "Diwali, which falls on Oct. 20 this year, is derived from the word \u201cDeepavali,\u201d which means \u201ca row of lights.\u201d Celebrants light rows of lamps to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. The holiday is celebrated with festive gatherings, fireworks displays, feasts and prayer.",
      "While Diwali is a major religious festival for Hindus, it is also observed by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. The origin story of Diwali varies depending on the region. All these stories, across faiths, have the same underlying themes of good triumphing over evil and light over darkness.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky's attorney general claimed Tuesday that the online gaming platform Roblox has become a \u201cplayground for predators\u201d as he announced a lawsuit accusing the company of lax child safety measures.",
      "The Kentucky suit, filed by his office Monday in a state court, is the latest action alleging that the wildly popular site isn\u2019t doing enough to protect children on its gaming services.",
      "To bolster safeguards for children and teenagers flocking to the site, the company needs to install effective age verifications and content filters, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said. Added parental notifications also are needed, he said.",
      "Courtney Norris, a Kentucky mother of three who joined Coleman at a news conference, said she mistakenly viewed Roblox as a safe online gaming choice for her children.",
      "\"I came to realize, later than I would like to admit, that it actually is the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of the internet, targeted at children,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cWe have rigorous safety measures in place from advanced AI models to an expertly trained team of thousands moderating our platform 24/7 for inappropriate content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \"No system is perfect and our work on safety is never done.

      "Roblox says it has 111 million daily active users. The company said in an email Tuesday that it implements strict safety defaults for its youngest users. It said the platform's users under 13 cannot directly message others on Roblox, outside of games or experiences, and cannot directly message others during games or experiences unless the default setting is changed using parental controls.",
      "The company said it has rigorous text chat filters to block inappropriate words and phrases, attempts to direct under-13 users off the platform and the sharing of personal information such as phone number or address. It does not allow user-to-user image sharing and prohibits sexual conversations, it said.",

      "\u201cCalifornia is taking action to confront hate in all its forms. At a time when antisemitism and bigotry are rising nationwide and globally, these laws make clear: our schools must be places of learning, not hate,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The law creates an Office of Civil Rights with a governor-appointed coordinator who will develop and provide training to help school employees identify and prevent antisemitism. The coordinator has to consult with the State Board of Education to make recommendations to the Legislature on policies to address anti-Jewish discrimination in schools.",
      "The new civil rights office could cost the state about $4 million annually, including money for six staffers, according to the Government Operations Agency, which oversees departments in the Newsom administration.",
      "Students in public schools nationwide are generally protected against discrimination through state, federal and district policies. But lawmakers in states including Missouri, Vermont and Tennessee have pushed further by introducing legislation aimed specifically at combating antisemitism at K-12 schools. The efforts come amid political tensions in the U.S. over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill earlier this year that would have banned teachers from promoting antisemitism in schools. She said the bill was about attacking teachers, not about combating antisemitism.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has paused or frozen federal funding at colleges, including the University of California, Los Angeles, over allegations that they failed to adequately respond to antisemitism. UC President James B. Milliken has said the cuts, which are being litigated, won't address anti-Jewish acts and that the university system's efforts to address antisemitism went ignored.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which supports the new law, tracked 860 antisemitic acts reported to the group last year at non-Jewish K-12 schools nationwide. Reports include harassment, vandalism and assault. That's a 26% decrease from the previous year but much higher than the 494 reported in 2022.",
      "Lev Miller Ruderman, a Jewish student at San Lorenzo Valley High School near the coastal city of Santa Cruz, said at a legislative hearing that school officials did not take an antisemitic act on campus seriously during his freshman year.",
      "Another student used school materials to make a Nazi flag and pinned it to Ruderman\u2019s back, he said. Ruderman walked past numerous students across campus before a teacher asked him about it, he said.",

      "Many controversial subjects have conflicting facts depending on perspective, said Seth Bramble, a California Teachers Association manager. Not being allowed to teach those facts reinforces rote learning over critical thinking and gives advocates \u201ca new legal tool to disrupt instruction and to threaten educators,\u201d she said.",

      "The law no longer references Israel's war in Gaza, but critics have said it could still have a chilling effect and prevent open discussion on contentious issues in the classroom.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A man's DNA was found on a gasoline can that was placed under a news vehicle in a failed arson attempt in Salt Lake City, federal prosecutors allege in court documents.",
      "Christopher Solomon Proctor, 45, lit a fuse attached to the 2.5 gallon (9.5 liter) plastic gas container that he had put under a news vehicle owned by the local Fox affiliate, KSTU-TV, that was parked outside of a building on Sept. 12, according to the filings. The fuse went out before the gas ignited.",
      "Proctor has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted arson and possession of an unregistered destructive device. His attorney, Richard Sorenson, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "During a hearing Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Dustin Pead ordered Proctor, who was arrested Sept. 29, to remain in jail until his trial. Pead said there was evidence that Proctor had planned to repeat the attempt, despite family and friends insisting that Proctor posed no danger to others, according to court documents.",
      "A license plate reader recorded Proctor's vehicle near the scene within minutes of the crime, and investigators found items in Proctor's home similar to those used to carry out the attempted arson, including black boots, a different gas can that also had a hole carved in the top, and a portion of fuse, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Thorpe wrote.",
      "According to prosecutors, Proctor bought more fuse days after the failed attempt and returned to the crime scene a week later. Proctor \u201chad mentioned burning Fox News on previous occasions\u201d to others, and told an acquaintance that he lit a fuse under a \u201cfox news\u201d vehicle but it did not blow up, Thorpe wrote.",
      "\u201cThat purchase, the presence of another gas-can at his residence and the deliberate resurveilling of the news station lead to an inference that the defendant may not have been satisfied with his failed attempt,\u201d Thorpe wrote.",

      "Trump signed into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 legislation to ensure federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund the government.",
      "The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic \u2014 a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen the government, now in the seventh day of a shutdown.",
      "\u201cThere are some people that don\u2019t deserve to be taken care of, and we\u2019ll take care of them in a different way,\u201d Trump said during an event at the White House.",

      "Refusing retroactive pay to the workers, some of whom must remain on the job as essential employees, would be a stark departure from norms and practices and almost certainly would be met with legal action.",
      "While federal workers \u2014 as well as service members of the military \u2014 have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are almost always reimbursed once the government reopens.",

Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",

      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12.

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi will face lawmakers at a congressional hearing amid growing questions about political influence over the Justice Department",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi will face lawmakers at a congressional hearing Tuesday amid growing questions about political influence over a Justice Department that has already criminally charged one of President Donald Trump's longtime foes and is facing intense White House pressure to prosecute others.",
      "The testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes just ahead of former FBI Director James Comey's first court appearance following an indictment that has deepened concerns that the department is being used to seek vengeance against the president's political opponents. It also comes as federal law enforcement officials surge into several cities across the U.S. to combat crime and enforce immigration laws.",
      "The hearing is likely to split along deeply partisan lines, with Republicans expected to laud the Justice Department's efforts to confront violent crime and reverse Biden-era priorities. Democrats, by contrast, are poised to grill Bondi about a turbulent eight-month tenure that, in addition to politically charged investigations, has also been defined by mass firings and resignations of experienced prosecutors, including some who investigated Trump, resisted Trump administration pressure or simply served in senior roles in the prior administration.",
      "Bondi's appearance is her first before the panel since her confirmation hearing last January, when she pledged to not play politics with the Justice Department \u2014 a promise Democrats are likely to pounce on as they press the attorney general on whether she can withstand pressure from a president publicly calling to charge his perceived enemies.",
      "Bondi and other Republican allies have said the Biden administration, which brought two criminal cases against Trump, was the one that weaponized the department even though some of its most high-profile probes concerned the Democratic president and his son.",
      "The Comey indictment is likely to take center stage at the hearing. The U.S. attorney's office in Virginia that brought the case had expressed reservations about the strength of evidence, and the Trump administration had to race to install a new prosecutor to secure the charges after the experienced leader of that office resigned days earlier under pressure.",

Adam Schiff \u2014 who sits on the Judiciary Committee \u2014 as well as New York Attorney General Letitia James and Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor and current mayoral candidate. They have all denied wrongdoing, as has Comey, and have slammed the investigations as politically motivated.",
      "Bondi is likely to tout the Justice Department's efforts to tackle violent crime by surging federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and now Memphis, Tennessee. Republican lawmakers who make up the majority of the committee will also likely highlight the department's focus on illegal immigration and dismantling Mexican cartels responsible for smuggling drugs into American communities.",
      "The attorney general may also face questions about the Justice Department's handling of investigative files related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The wealthy financier's case has dogged the department since its decision in July not to publicly release any more files in its possession after raising the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.",
      "But even in the face of intense conservative outrage, Bondi maintained the strong public support of the president.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon is marking the 200th anniversary of organized emigration from his homeland to the United States, highlighting the deep connections between the two countries with a visit to the heart of Norwegian America.",
      "The Upper Midwest has some of the largest concentrations of Scandinavian Americans in the U.S., and his tour takes him Tuesday to Minnesota, where well over 800,000 residents claim Norwegian ancestry, according to state demographers. That's more than any other state, though less-populous North Dakota actually has a higher percentage of residents with Norwegian roots. Members of the royal family have made several visits to the region over the years.",
      "Haakon's visit is part of the Crossings 200 commemorations across North America this year.",
      "Nearly 5 million North Americans now claim Norwegian ancestry. The U.S. was a relatively welcoming place for Scandinavians during the main waves of emigration that began in the 1800s. They were drawn to the Upper Midwest by cheap land and jobs.",
      "But much has changed since then, and today immigration is a contentious issue for both the U.S. and Scandinavian and other European countries.",
      "Haakon went Monday to Vesterheim, a museum in Decorah, Iowa, that tells the story of Norwegian immigrants in America. He met there with three descendants of people who arrived on the Restauration, a ship carrying 52 Norwegians that left July 4, 1825, from Stavanger. One of the travelers gave birth on the long voyage, so 53 arrived in New York. More than 800,000 other Norwegians eventually followed.",
      "The crown prince also visited Luther College in Decorah, a school founded by Norwegian immigrants in 1861, which presented him with an honorary degree.",
      "\u201cI will carry it as a symbol of the close friendship between the United States and Norway,\" Haakon told students and faculty. \"Thank you for keeping alive the stories that bind us together across oceans, across generations, across time.\u201d",
      "According to the school, it was the ninth visit to Decorah by members of the royal family since 1939. The most recent previous visit to town was by his parents, King Harald V, who is Europe's oldest monarch, and Queen Sonja, in 2011.",
      "On Tuesday, Haakon was due to visit Norway House, a cultural center in Minneapolis that focuses on bringing contemporary Norway to the U.S. through arts, business and culture.",
      "The crown prince was due to cut a ribbon and tour Norway House's new Saga Center. It's an immersive, interactive exhibit for families to explore their connections with Norway, where they can also navigate 3D outdoor and urban landscapes to learn about the country's friluftsliv (outdoor life) and byliv (city life).",

      "River otters, manatees, seat turtles, penguins and sharks are among the marine animals getting a new home in Florida",
      "Crews used large nets, water-filled containers and box trucks to relocate hundreds of river otters, sea turtles, manatees, penguins and sharks to their new home: Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.",
      "Over the past couple of months, the marine animals were removed from the hard-to-reach island and relocated to a brand new center, where Mote believes they will be able to live in more authentic habitats and make it easier for the public to learn about marine sciences. The Mote Science Education Aquarium, just east of Sarasota, is set to open to the public on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe have created new authentic habitats for all our species of marine life, including a massive manatee habitat, and homes for some of our newest animals, like the giant Pacific octopus and our penguins,\" said Kevin Cooper, vice president for communications and strategic Initiatives at Mote.",
      "\u201cWe are also adding more opportunities to learn about marine science for our guests, school children and adult learners and offering new opportunities for citizen scientists to participate in marine science through outreach,\u201d he said.",
      "It was increasingly challenging for visitors to make their way across the bridges from the mainland to the facility on Sarasota's City Island where it had been for 45 years. So it made sense to move the aquarium and education centers farther east while keeping the research portion of the facility on the barrier island.",
      "In July, Mote closed to the public to prepare so the transition could begin. And in August, crews started moving the animals to the new facility.",
      "Mote educated upwards of 350,000 guests each year and it's expected to double that in the new center, Cooper said. It cost $130 million to build.",
      "It took time to make sure the habitats at the new Mote SEA facility had the appropriate water chemistry and microbial communities before the animals arrived.",
      "\u201cIn the process of that relocation, each different species requires a different type of relocation techniques in order to move them from one facility to another,\" said Evan Barniskis, associate vice president for Mote. \u201cWhen moving sharks and fish, you have to do so in water with plenty of oxygen and filtration on it.\u201d",
      "They moved many of the fish and sharks at night, when there was less traffic. The manatees required air-conditioned box trucks that are specifically designed for manatee relocations. Mote has a team devoted to picking up stranded manatees and to rehabilitate them.",
      "\u201cThe otters are a little bit simpler because they have specially designed cages that are kind of similar to those you would put a dog or a cat in,\u201d Barniskis said. He added that they moved them in air-conditioned vehicles.",

    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean.",
      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Mr. Trump's remarks were left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team by The Associated Press.",
      "Combs' sentencing for two prostitution-related charges capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called \"freak-offs,\" and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.",
      "While the criminal case against Combs came to an end, he still faces civil lawsuits, including from a former stylist who accused Combs of sexually, physically and emotionally abusing him while he was working for Combs and his label, Bad Boy Entertainment \u2014 allegations that Combs has denied, with his legal team calling them \"falsehoods.\"",
      "Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul. The 39-year-old stylist claims Combs choked him multiple times, describing one alleged incident that occurred after he went to a restaurant with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend whose testimony was critical in his conviction.",
      "The \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer was convicted in July under the federal\u00a0Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.",
      "Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.",
      "In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a \"spiritual reset\" in jail and is \"committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.\"",
      "\"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,\" he wrote.",
      "Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.",
      "Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",
      "Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.",
      "His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.",
      "FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.",
      "In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.",
      "In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.",
      "During his time at Fort Dix, Shkreli ended up in solitary confinement amid allegations he was using a contraband smartphone to run his drug company from behind bars. Inmates are forbidden from conducting business and possessing cellphones.",

    "story": [
      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",
      "In a way, music was a by-product of a lifelong search, says Islam (also known as Cat Stevens), who met with us backstage in London.",
      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",
      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",
      "In his new memoir, \"Cat on the Road to Findout,\" he explores family, faith, career, and ego.",
      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",

      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

      "Swift is the only female musical artist in history to sell more than 100 million albums. Her newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" created a frenzy when it was released Friday.",
      "\"In terms of a business person, Taylor is at the top,\" said Kevin Evers, author of the new book \"There's Nothing Like This: The Strategic Genius of Taylor Swift,\" and a senior editor at the Harvard Business Review. \"She's always been extremely business savvy, and we can see this with this release, too.\"",
      "Evers says that Swift has always been \"really fan-obsessed.\"",
      "\"So if you look at all the album variants, and all this new stuff that she's doing around this album, she's really trying to give her fans as much value as possible,\" Evers said.",
      "In August, Swift announced \"The Life of a Showgirl\" on the popular podcast of her now-fianc\u00e9, Travis Kelce. She said the album was inspired by the record-smashing Eras Tour, the first-ever tour to gross more than $2 billion.",
      "\"This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and, and vibrant,\" Swift said on the podcast.",
      "Since then, countdowns on her website appeared for limited edition vinyl records, CDs and cardigans, all of which sold out within minutes. \u00a0 \"I mean, she's definitely going to make a lot of money from this album, and she's not shy about that,\" Evers said. \"But at the same time, the reason why all these strategies are working is because her fans are actively engaged.\"",

      "Through her groundbreaking observations while living among chimpanzees in the jungles of Tanzania, anthropologist and conservationist Jane Goodall (April 3, 1934-Oct. 1, 2025) transformed the study of the animal world after witnessing chimps fashioning and using tools, which at the time was believed to be unique to humans. Her field research also documented the distinct personalities of the chimps she studied. Through her books, articles, documentary films and public appearances over six decades, Goodall changed how the world perceived homo sapien's closest relative in all their emotional and social complexity.",
      "Her fascination with animals began in childhood, spending hours in a tree reading \"Tarzan.\" \"There was no TV back then,\" Goodall told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"That's when my dream began. I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it. No intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "Working in Nairobi as an assistant to Louis Leakey, the paleoanthropologist raised money for Goodall to spend six months studying chimpanzees in the Gombe rain forest in Tanzania bringing her \"fresh pair of eyes and fiery spirit,\" she said. \"I clearly was passionate. I clearly had an understanding of animals. And he felt that women might be better in the field, that we might be more patient. Also, he wanted somebody who hadn't been to college, so he wanted an unbiased mind.\"",
      "Living among the chimpanzees, she eventually gained the animals' trust. She witnessed chimps fashioning and using tools \u2014 using twigs to fish for termites. She also detected chimps having distinct personalities and share \"human\" emotions, like pleasure, sadness and fear. She documented the bond between mother and child, and sibling rivalry. \"A lot of people refused to believe it,\" Goodall said. \"Why should they believe this young girl? She hadn't even been to college!\"",
      "But National Geographic sent cameraman Hugo van Lawick, and his film corroborated her findings. He also photographed Goodall \u2014 and became her husband.",
      "She later founded the Jane Goodall Institute, and devoted decades of her life to education about and advocacy for protecting the environment. She gave lectures and toured; she was typically on the road 300 days a year, and was in California on a speaking tour when she died.",
      "Four years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap?\u00a0Why\u00a0is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? \u2026 If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all. You know, even if you just pick one thing, like eating less meat. Just do\u00a0something.\""

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "\"This is a major, major step, and we have to do it,\" Makary told CBS News when asked if, even with the discounts, the drugs will still be unaffordable for many Americans.",

      "More than 90% of Americans have some form of health insurance, yet many still struggle to afford critical medications. Wisniewski told CBS News she is skeptical about the new TrumpRx program.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",

      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",

Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",

      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",

      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-ross-paintings-auction-public-radio-broadcast-npr-pbs/",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 14:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Thirty paintings by Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to support public television stations after federal funding cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

    "story": [
      "The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching\u00a0into its second week, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions that would compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\" NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's\u00a0website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "Sick calls edge up",
      "The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick since the shutdown began last week.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.",
      "\"They have bills,\" he said. \"So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. \u2026 We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Duffy told\u00a0CNBC that controllers are anxious both because the job itself is demanding and because \"they're concerned they may not get a paycheck.\"",
      "The \"shutdown is forcing them to work without the guarantee that their paychecks come in a timely manner. So they're stressed,\" he added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions,\" NATCA said in the message to workers.\u00a0\"We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"Uncertainty and hardships\"",
      "In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown \"creates uncertainty and hardships for our members.\"",
      "NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a rise in worker absences\u00a0and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials.",
      "During the 34-day government shutdown from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, according to the agency, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.",
      "More recently, a\u00a0nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, more than 90% of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit\u00a0fly.faa.gov\u00a0for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)",
      "As the impasse in Congress continues, the Senate is expected to hold procedural votes again on Monday night on dueling measures to fund the government and end the shutdown.",

      "\"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" played at hundreds of theaters nationwide over the weekend to enthusiastic fans decked out in friendship bracelets and other Swift-themed attire. The movie featured the world premiere of Swift's music video, \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" one of the 12 tracks on her new studio album, along with behind-the-scenes footage.",

These first drafts honoring America's 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real,\" U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a social media post on Friday, which included drawings of the coin. \"Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.\"",
      "The obverse, or heads, side of the coin features Mr. Trump's profile, while the tails side depicts the president with his fist raised and a U.S. flag flying behind him, which is reminiscent of the photo taken after a\u00a0failed assassination attempt\u00a0on the president in Pennsylvania last year. The tails side also has the words \"fight fight fight\" emblazoned over Mr. Trump's image.",

      "While federal law\u00a0prohibits the U.S. Treasury from issuing currency with the image of either a living former or current president, there may be more leeway with commemorative coins produced by the U.S. Mint. Currency is produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, while commemorative coins are produced by the U.S. Mint, which is part of the Treasury Department.",
      "Regulations also state there must be a two-year period after the death of a former or current president before issuing currency with their likeness. Historically, the restriction is to avoid the appearance of a monarchy, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.",
      "Under a\u00a02021 law, the Treasury is authorized to issue $1 commemorative coins to mark the nation's 250th anniversary.",
      "The U.S. Mint has also recently issued commemorative quarters, with the agency announcing in December that it would feature five famous women \u2014 all deceased \u2014 on the 25-cent coins. They include Ida B. Wells, Juliette Gordon Low, Dr. Vera Rubin, Stacey Park Milbern and Althea Gibson.",

    "summary": "Furloughed federal workers are entitled to back pay by law, but contractors are not. Here's who gets paid and who doesn't.",
    "story": [
      "When the government shuts down, many federal workers go without paychecks, whether they are deemed essential and required to show up for work or whether they're furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Such employees are by law entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached, but independent contractors who sell goods or services to the U.S. government are not similarly protected.",
      "Dan Koh, the former chief of staff at the Labor Department under President Biden, recently said on his podcast that workers employed by companies that have contracts with the government are hurt in a shutdown.",
      "That's because there's no guarantee such workers will be paid once the government reopens, according to Koh. But even federal workers who eventually receive back pay can suffer during a shutdown, as many of them live paycheck to paycheck, he added.",
      "\"Even if you are entitled to back pay, a lot of people can't go even a couple of days without their regularly scheduled paycheck,\" he told CBS News. \"If you have to pay your subway fare, for gas, if something breaks in your home, and you're not getting paid, it places extreme stress on government employees,\" he said.",
      "Members of Congress and the President continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown.",
      "Who gets paid and who does not?",
      "Federal workers, including both furloughed and excepted government employees, receive back pay under a federal law guaranteeing that they'll eventually be made whole.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019\u00a0states that workers who are furloughed due to a lapse in federal funding, as well as excepted workers who are considered essential and required to work without being paid, all receive back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "By contrast, workers and businesses that contract with the government are not similarly guaranteed delayed compensation.",
      "Roughly 620,000 people, or about 28% of federal workers, are projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an Oxford Economics analysis of government data. Additionally, millions of private sector workers who are supported by federal grants and contracts could see their pay be affected by the shutdown, according to the economic advisory firm.",
      "The group estimates that the government supports up to an additional 10 million private workers through federal grants and contracts.",
      "In 2024, the federal government spent about $755 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "\"The government is the largest buyer of goods and services, so when they are not paying, it's not ripples, it's waves,\" Aron Beezley, co-leader of the Government Contracts Practice Group at Bradley, a national law firm, told CBS News.",
      "Personnel needed to process payment",
      "Some federal contracts are fully funded, meaning the government has already allocated money to a given job, and it's likely to continue.",
      "\"If your contract is fully funded by the previous year's appropriations, your contract will go forward, generally speaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "But even then, companies can expect snags in getting paid on schedule during a shutdown. That's because government personnel tasked with processing contractor invoices might not be at work.",
      "\"When you submit invoices during a shutdown, the system the government uses to pay contractors requires human involvement. Invoices need to be reviewed, and a lot of times a contractor has questions for the folks who process invoices,\" Beezley explained.",
      "As a result, contractors with fully funded contracts can encounter practical impediments to receiving payments they are owed.",
      "\"If nobody is home to process the invoice, it can be challenging to get paid, which can create cash flow issues, particularly for small businesses,\" Beezley said.",
      "Partially funded contracts",
      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",
      "In 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introduced legislation to secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.",
      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",
      "As far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.",
      "\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"",

      "Pritzker issued a statement on X in response to President Trump's post.",
      "\"I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?\" Pritzker wrote.",
      "Pritzker continued in a thread of X posts: \"His masked agents already are grabbing people off the street. Separating children from their parents. Creating fear. Taking people for 'how they look.' Making people feel they need to carry citizenship papers. Invading our state with military troops. Sending in war helicopters in the middle of the night. Arresting elected officials asking questions.\"",
      "Mayor Johnson also posted to X.",
      "\"This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested,\" he wrote. \"I'm not going anywhere.\"",
      "Arrests,\u00a0raids\u00a0and\u00a0protests\u00a0have become daily occurrences as the presence of ICE in Chicago has drastically increased since the Department of Homeland Security launched what it dubbed \"Operation Midway Blitz\" at the beginning of September.",
      "On Tuesday, Mayor Johnson signed an executive order prohibiting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies from using city property for\u00a0civil immigration enforcement.",
      "The order prohibits federal authorities from using city-owned or controlled parking lots, vacant lots and garages as staging areas, processing locations or operations bases for\u00a0civil immigration enforcement activity.",
      "Meanwhile, Pritzker has taken Mr. Trump to task repeatedly for his use of federal forces, and most recently for deploying National Guard troops to Illinois. The deployment comes amid clashes between demonstrators and federal agents outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, Illinois, where, within the past couple of weeks, over a dozen protesters were arrested.",
      "On Tuesday night, Pritzker also denounced federal immigration enforcement in Chicago.",
      "\"It is striking fear in the hearts of everybody in Chicago, and we have residents \u2014 this isn't just about undocumented people,\" Pritzker said Tuesday night during a discussion in Minnesota with that state's governor, Tim Walz. \"U.S. citizens who are brown or Black are being stopped only for that reason, and asked for identification that proves they're a U.S. citizen.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-james-comey-arraignment-doj-trump-what-to-expect/",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 11:45:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump, appeared in Virginia for an arraignment, in his first court appearance since he was charged.",
    "story": [
      "Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from congressional testimony he gave five years ago, appearing in court for an arraignment Wednesday after the Justice Department criminally charged the ex-FBI chief and Trump foe in late September.",
      "The proceeding at the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, came nearly two weeks after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation when he testified before a Senate panel in September 2020.",
      "Comey spoke during the proceedings Wednesday. When the judge asked whether he understood the charges, he replied, \"I do, your honor, thank you very much.\" Prosecutors did not seek to have him detained, and Comey was released on his own recognizance.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who is presiding over the case, set a trial date for early January, though that could change. Comey will seek to have the indictment dismissed before a trial, his lawyer said.",
      "During the arraignment, Nathaniel Lemons, one of the federal prosecutors brought on to work on the case, said it could involve classified information, which could bring complications. Nachmanoff, however, noted that only two charges have been brought against Comey.",
      "\"The government is going to be under an extraordinary amount of pressure\" to produce classified documents or declassify them, Nachmanoff said. \"There should be no reason this case gets off track.\"",
      "Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey's lawyer, told the court that they \"see this as a simple case.\"",
      "Prosecutors estimated a trial will take two to three days, though Fitzgerald said he would seek to have the case dismissed on several grounds: vindictive and unlawful prosecution, and the legality of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment to that role.",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he had selected Halligan to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert from the post.",
      "Siebert had been kept on as the top prosecutor for the office by the judges on the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia in May. Because of the involvement of judges in that district in extending Siebert's tenure as U.S. attorney, the challenge to Halligan's appointment will be heard by other judges outside the district.",
      "Comey has said he's innocent and, in a video after he was indicted, declared \"let's have a trial.\" His wife, Patrice, and daughter, Maurene, a former prosecutor in New York, were in the courtroom for the proceeding. Maurene Comey was fired from the Justice Department in July and has since sued the Trump administration over her ouster.",
      "The Justice Department's prosecution of the former FBI director marked a significant escalation in President Trump's efforts to go after his political foes. Mr. Trump has for years attacked Comey, who was FBI director when the bureau investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "Days before Comey was indicted, the president took to social media to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against the former FBI director and other political opponents, writing, \"We can't delay any longer.\"",
      "More on Comey's arraignment",
      "The arraignment took place in open court, but cameras were not allowed.",
      "Comey's lawyer said his team would file several motions to have the charges dismissed, including alleging the former FBI director is a victim of vindictive prosecution and arguing the U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Halligan, was appointed invalidly.",
      "\"Patrick Fitzgerald is a hell of a lawyer, and I would not want to pre-guess what strategy he's going to follow here,\" said Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Where did Comey's arraignment take place?",
      "Comey was arraigned at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, which is part of the Eastern District of Virginia. The case is likely being heard there because the charges are based on a 2020 Senate hearing that Comey attended remotely from his Virginia home.",
      "If the case goes to trial, Comey will face a jury pool made up of residents of the Washington, D.C., suburbs \u2014 an area that generally disfavors President Trump.",
      "Some 62.6% of voters in the eastern district's Alexandria division voted for Democrat Kamala Harris last year, and 34.1% voted for Mr. Trump. The division includes Alexandria and several other cities and counties in Northern Virginia.",
      "Who is the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan?",
      "The case against Comey is being overseen by Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who was sworn into the role just days before Comey was indicted.",
      "A former Florida insurance lawyer, Halligan previously worked as a personal attorney to Mr. Trump, and was part of his defense team in a federal case accusing him of mishandling classified documents. More recently, Halligan worked as a White House aide.",
      "She took over the office after the resignation of former acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "In an unusual move, Halligan has handled parts of the prosecution herself so far. She personally signed Comey's indictment and appeared in court when the grand jury returned the indictment.",
      "Two assistant U.S. attorneys from the Eastern District of North Carolina were added to the case Tuesday: Gabriel Diaz and Nathaniel Lemons.",
      "Who is Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald?",
      "Comey is being represented by Fitzgerald, a well-known attorney who retired as a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 2023.",
      "Fitzgerald was named special counsel in George W. Bush's administration, to investigate\u00a0 a 2003 leak that revealed the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame. He also served as U.S. attorney in Chicago for more than a decade, overseeing the prosecution of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.",
      "Who is Judge Nachmanoff?",
      "Nachmanoff was assigned to oversee Comey's case. He was nominated to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in a 52-46 vote. Three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting yes: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
      "Nachmanoff previously worked in the district as a public defender and magistrate judge. While in the latter role, he oversaw the 2019 arraignment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two players in Mr. Trump's first impeachment who were charged with campaign finance violations.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked Nachmanoff, writing on Truth Social that Comey \"was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he's off to a very good start.\"",
      "What is Comey charged with?",
      "The first count accuses him of making a false statement in a September 2020 Senate hearing.",
      "Prosecutors allege Comey falsely asserted he had never authorized an FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton. In a testy back-and-forth five years ago, Comey told Republican Sen. Ted Cruz that he stood by testimony he gave in 2017 in which he said he didn't approve any anonymous sources.",
      "The indictment does not explain the substance of the alleged leak or specify which FBI staffer Comey is accused of giving permission to leak.",
      "Cruz's questions focused on an incident in which Comey and his onetime deputy, Andrew McCabe, gave inconsistent stories about a 2016 Wall Street Journal article on one of the FBI's Clinton probes. McCabe said he told Comey after the story came out that McCabe had authorized staffers to talk to the Journal, but Comey says McCabe told him no such thing. The Justice Department's internal watchdog sided with Comey and found McCabe lacked candor.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CNN interview, McCabe said he hasn't been approached by the FBI in connection with the Comey probe and doubted the indictment was about him, noting that he didn't ask Comey for permission to release information to the media because he didn't need permission.",
      "Comey has also been probed by the Justice Department's watchdog for releasing memos on his interactions with Mr. Trump to his friend, Daniel Richman, who shared their contents to the New York Times. The watchdog found Comey violated FBI policies but didn't leak classified material.",
      "The second count against Comey accuses him of obstructing a congressional proceeding by \"making false and misleading statements\" in the same 2020 hearing.",
      "And in a rare move, the grand jury declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress in the 2020 hearing, relating to testimony Comey gave lawmakers that he didn't remember getting a tip from the intelligence community referring to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump.",
      "Many critics believe the Comey indictment is the result of Mr. Trump's determination to punish a longtime political foe. The president fired Comey in 2017, and the two have traded barbs since then. Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey before he was charged, and the president celebrated the indictment shortly after it was handed down.",
      "Before Comey was charged, some staff in the Office of the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia circulated a memo arguing charges should not be brought, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the case. After Comey was indicted, Bondi said in a statement the move \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"",

      "California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by\u00a0candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race.",
      "Xavier Becerra, Chad Bianco, Ian Calderon, Stephen J. Cloobeck, Steve Hilton, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa, Butch Ware, Betty Yee and Leo Zacky shared their thoughts and where they stand on the issue.",
      "Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing\u00a0five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats\u00a0to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for\u00a0Texas' recent redistricting, which favors Republicans in the midterms.",
      "Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an\u00a0independent redistricting commission.\u00a0Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.",
      "Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50.",
      "While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.",
      "What do you think of the governor's plan?",
      "Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would \"make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress.\"",
      "Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is \"totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal.\"",
      "\"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps,\" Hilton said. \"I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that.\"",
      "Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California,\" Calderon said.",
      "However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50. \u00a0\"She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.",
      "Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal \"unconstitutional,\" criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes.",
      "\"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn,\" he said. \"[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste.\"",
      "Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.",
      "\"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism,\" Ware said.",
      "While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort \"essential\" to prevent the manipulation of elections, \"as the president has asked the state of Texas to do.\"",
      "\"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census\u2026 And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation,\" Yee said. \"We have to fight that.\"",
      "Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter \"gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas.\"",
      "\"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide.\"",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.",
      "\"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" Villaraigosa said.",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said \"we have to preserve Democracy.\" Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in \"support of the governor's plan.\"",
      "Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.",
      "\"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you,\" Bianco said. \"Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more.\"",
      "Message to Californians who voted for Trump",
      "The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.",
      "Becerra said he would talk to them \"straight out\" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.",
      "\"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote,\" he said.",
      "Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.",
      "\"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing,\" Calderon said. \"They just want to be heard.\"",
      "Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.",
      "\"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts,\" he said. \"Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything.\"",
      "Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.",
      "\"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts,\" Yee said. \"I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?\"",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.",
      "\"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them,\" Cloobeck said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.",
      "\"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few.\"",
      "Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate\u00a0to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need republican voters to win.",
      "\"How would I need them in order to win?\" Porter asked. \"If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump.\"",
      "As several of her opponents noted, in\u00a0California's top-two open primary\u00a0system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.",
      "Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.",
      "The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.",
      "Do two wrongs make a right?",
      "The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma\u00a0that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?",
      "\"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more,\" Bianco said.",
      "Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.",
      "\"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026,\" Becerra said. \"So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count.\"",
      "Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it \"kind of a sh---- choice\" but emphasizing the political stakes.",
      "\"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress.\"",
      "Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.",
      "\"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them,\" Ware said. \"They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.",
      "\"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data\u2026 They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it,\" she said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.",
      "\"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" he said.",
      "Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 \"an important moment for voters to decide.\"",
      "Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.",
      "\"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back,\" she said.",
      "Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California,\" he said.",
      "Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.",
      "\"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where,\" he said. \"Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement.\"",
      "Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had \"a massively distorted political map.\"",
      "Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, \"With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%.\"",
      "Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.",
      "\"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea,\" Hilton said.",
      "While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.",

    "summary": "Active-duty troops and National Guard members on missions will continue to work with the promise of back pay after Congress passes legislation to fund the government.",
    "story": [
      "Congress failed to reach a funding deal by Wednesday morning's deadline, leading to a government shutdown that will force active-duty service members to continue to serve without pay until a deal is made.",
      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:19:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",

      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump has also proposed a peace plan for Israel and Gaza, and spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week. Still, he told CBS News in September 2025 that he is not seeking the prize.",
      "\"I have nothing to say about it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"All I can do is put out wars.\" He added, \"I don't seek attention. I just want to save lives.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Trump was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP.",

      "Van Epps clinched the GOP victory following an endorsement from President Trump that came after in-person early voting ended. Eleven Republicans were on the ballot for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned over the summer due to \"an opportunity in the private sector that was too exciting to pass up.\" Among them, two candidates suspended their campaigns after Mr. Trump weighed in and joined the president in endorsing Van Epps.",
      "\"Thank you to the people of Middle and West Tennessee! Our Donald J. Trump-endorsed campaign won in a landslide tonight,\" Van Epps said on social media. \"Now, on to December 2nd! We're going to win the general and keep this seat RED!\"",
      "If Republicans hold onto the seat, it would slightly expand their margin in the U.S. House, where the GOP holds a single-digit majority. The general election in December could also gauge the popularity of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, especially with Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area.",
      "The 7th Congressional District spans 14 counties, bordering both Kentucky and Alabama. Along with parts of Nashville, it includes rural areas, wealthy suburbs and part of a military installation, Fort Campbell. The seat is one of three districts that GOP lawmakers drew as safely red in 2022 by dividing left-leaning Nashville. Its voters elected Green by 21 percentage points in 2024 and by nearly 22 points in 2022.",
      "Of its nine seats in the House, Tennessee currently has one Democrat, Rep. Steve Cohen of Memphis. Republican redistricting in 2022 allowed the GOP to flip another Democratic seat that was drawn to include only part of Nashville.",
      "Van Epps previously served in several roles under Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. During the primary campaign, Van Epps leaned into his military experience, including as a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and as an Army Special Operations helicopter pilot. Among the competitors he defeated were state Reps. Jody Barrett and Gino Bulso.",
      "Behn is a social worker and community organizer who has focused on women's reproductive health rights, including as a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a Tennessee law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission. A judge has halted the provision's enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed Van Epps in a Truth Social post late last week that praised him as an \"America First Patriot.\"",
      "\"A West Point Graduate, and Combat Decorated Army Helicopter Pilot, Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The nod from Mr. Trump followed Van Epps' prior endorsements from Lee, Green and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.",
      "Outside groups spent more than $3.1 million on the race, almost all on the GOP side, with about $1.1 million opposing Barrett.",
      "The Republican primary contenders praised Mr. Trump and expressed staunch opposition to anything perceived as liberal or \"woke.\" Meanwhile, in the Democratic primary, the four candidates attacked the legislation Mr. Trump dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" in addition to his tariffs.",

      "President Trump nominated Walker for the diplomatic post last year, after the retired running back entered the political fray by running as the Republican nominee in Georgia's 2022 Senate race. He lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock by 2.8 points in a runoff.",
      "Walker is the first Senate-confirmed ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade.",
      "Walker won the Heisman Trophy in 1982 with the University of Georgia Bulldogs, and played professionally for three years for the U.S. Football League's New Jersey Generals \u2014 a team that Mr. Trump bought toward the end of Walker's career with the upstart league. After the USFL folded, Walker played in the NFL for more than a decade.",
      "He ran for Senate three years ago with Mr. Trump's backing. Walker's campaign was dogged by accusations that he paid several women to get abortions in the 1990s and 2000s, despite his opposition to the procedure while on the campaign trail. Walker vehemently denied the allegations.",
      "Walker was also named to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition during Mr. Trump's first term, but was removed during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Herschel has spent decades serving as an Ambassador to our Nation's youth, our men and women in the Military, and athletes at home and abroad,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a December Truth Social post nominating Walker to the ambassador role.",

    "summary": "Unlawful crossings on the southern border have hit a 55-year low, according to figures obtained by CBS News \u2014 as President Trump cracks down on illegal immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, amid the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, internal federal statistics obtained by CBS News show.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025, which began in October of last year and ended on Sept. 30, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security data, which has not been previously reported.",
      "The number is the lowest annual tally recorded by Border Patrol since fiscal year 1970, when the agency reported roughly 202,000 apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border, historical figures indicate.",
      "It also represents a seismic change from the record-high levels of Border Patrol apprehensions recorded under the Biden administration, which faced an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2022, Border Patrol made 2.2 million apprehensions there \u2014 a record, and almost 10 times the levels recorded in 2025.",
      "More than 60% of the apprehensions made by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2025 along the U.S.-Mexico border were recorded in the last full three months of the Biden administration, the preliminary data shows. Government fiscal years start in October and end in September, and some of them encompass different administrations.",
      "Over President Trump's first full eight months in office, Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border have recorded fewer than 9,000 apprehensions each month \u2014 a number that the agency recorded in 24-hour periods during some days under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The internal DHS figures show Border Patrol made nearly 8,400 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, an increase from 6,300 in August and 4,600 in July, a monthly record low.",
      "Border Patrol apprehensions denote the number of times agents intercepted and processed migrants entering the country between official ports of entry, which is illegal. Some migrants can be counted multiple times, if they attempt to enter the U.S. more than once after being turned back to Mexico.",
      "In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"President Trump has overwhelmingly delivered on his promise to secure our Southern Border.\"",
      "\"As a result, Americans are safer \u2014 unvetted criminal illegal aliens and dangerous drugs are no longer pouring over our border unchecked,\" Jackson added. \"And for all the Democrats who claimed it was impossible to secure the border or that they needed new policy, turns out all we needed was a new President.\"",
      "\"A new normal\"",
      "Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, noted that illegal border crossings began to fall sharply in the summer of 2024, after the Biden administration enacted strict limits on asylum. But he said the Trump administration had set \"a new normal\" for migration flows in just a few months.",
      "Ruiz Soto said the Trump administration's stringent policies \u2014 at the border and inside the U.S. \u2014 \"have had a significant effect on people being deterred from coming illegally to the United States.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office for a second time, his administration moved to seal and militarize the southern border, closing down the American asylum system using emergency powers, dispatching thousands of soldiers to repel illegal crossings and shutting down Biden-era programs that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally.",
      "While parts of the asylum ban have been curtailed and declared illegal by courts, the Trump administration has virtually ended the practice of releasing migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally, deporting them quickly or holding them in detention while their cases are reviewed.",
      "Beyond the border, the Trump administration has staged highly publicized operations targeting those living in the U.S. illegally, dispatching teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents across the country with the objective of overseeing a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions.",
      "The crackdown has not been without controversy. The administration's border policies have been denounced as inhumane, draconian and illegal by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged them in federal court on the grounds that they are at odds with U.S. and international asylum law as well as the Constitution.",
      "The federal immigration raids well beyond the border have also triggered significant backlash, particularly in major American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, where large-scale protests have erupted. National and local Democrats have decried the raids as indiscriminate and overly harsh, accusing the Trump administration of not solely focusing on deporting violent offenders.",
      "Citing confrontations and instances of violence, Mr. Trump in recent days has ordered National Guard troops to deploy to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to protect immigration agents and facilities there. A federal judge has so far blocked the plan to send National Guard units to Portland.",
      "Amid the national debate over immigration enforcement, those living along the southern border say there's no denying the reality on the ground has changed markedly.",
      "John Martin said his network of shelters in the Texas border city of El Paso housed hundreds of migrants during spikes in illegal crossings during the Biden administration. On Monday, he said his organization was not housing a single migrant, saying he's received \"little to no\" new arrivals who are not local homeless residents in recent months. He attributed it to Mr. Trump's crackdown.",
      "\"If the goal is to decrease the number of individuals, I would say that appears to have been successful, without getting into the politics about whether or not I like it or dislike it,\" Martin said. \"We're just simply not seeing the people.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 20:14:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard a challenge to a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" for minors that was brought by a licensed counselor in the state.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with a\u00a0Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" for minors.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, who argued the state's restriction unconstitutionally censors conversations about gender dysphoria and sexual orientation that she seeks to have with young patients. Chiles, who is Christian, said she wants to engage in talk therapy with minor clients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "But she said she fears that having those conversations with young patients puts her at risk of violating Colorado's law. Lower courts ruled against Chiles, finding Colorado's law regulates professional conduct.",
      "An issue at the center of the dispute, known as Chiles v. Salazar, is whether Colorado's ban regulates Chiles' professional conduct or her speech. Shannon Stevenson, Colorado's solicitor general, told the justices its law only regulates medical treatments and practices provided by a counselors licensed by the state. Jim Campbell, who argued on behalf of Chiles, told the court that the law seeks to transform therapists into \"mouthpieces for the government.\"",
      "Colorado's conversion therapy ban",
      "Called the Minor Conversion Therapy Law, Colorado's ban was enacted in 2019 and prohibits mental health professionals from engaging in any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "Violators face fines of up to $5,000 and risk being suspended from practicing or stripped of their license. Colorado is one of more than 20 states that have enacted bans on \"conversion therapy.\"",
      "Several years after Colorado's law took effect, Chiles sued state licensing officials, arguing that the ban violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations with patients based on viewpoint and the content of those discussions.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "But Campbell told the court that anonymous complaints have been filed against Chiles in recent weeks that the state is now investigating. He argued that there remains a \"credible threat of enforcement\" against her.",
      "At least two of the justices appeared skeptical of Colorado's interpretation of the law and its claim that Chiles would not be violating it with the types of discussions she wants to have with patients. Justice Neil Gorsuch called the state's reading of the law \"peculiar,\" while Justice Samuel Alito questioned how Stevenson \"can square your interpretation\" of the law with its plain meaning.",
      "Campbell argued that Colorado's ban forbids licensed counselors from helping minors pursue \"state disfavored goals\" on issues of gender and sexuality. The law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed under the law, he said.",
      "The law \"undermines the well-being\" of children struggling with gender dysphoria by restricting their access to certain kinds of talk therapy, Campbell said, and he argued Chiles is being \"silenced\" every day that Colorado's ban can be enforced against her.",
      "\"The Free Speech Clause forbids the State from censoring mutual conversations on important topics. This includes discussions between counselors and clients on deeply personal issues,\" lawyers with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group that is representing Chiles, wrote in filings. \"Colorado's viewpoint-based intrusion into the counseling room is unconstitutional.\"",
      "Campbell argued that the high court \"has recognized many times\" that one-on-one conversation, which is Chiles' method of treatment, is a form of speech.",
      "\"She's encouraging them to achieve their goals,\" he said of Chiles' discussions with clients, adding that \"this is an ongoing active dialogue\" that \"absolutely has to be protected\" by the First Amendment.",
      "But state officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from harmful practices, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "Stevenson, who argued on behalf of Colorado, said its law is a \"reasonable regulation\" of professional conduct. She told the justices that therapists have a fiduciary duty to protect their clients from substandard care.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials also refuted Chiles' claim that the state is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"At no time has the First Amendment been understood to confer on professionals a constitutional right to use words to deliver treatment that violates the standard of care,\" they argued.",
      "During the arguments, Alito asked Stevenson if a post-adolescent male is attracted to other males and wants a therapist's help in ending or lessening that attraction, would that be banned under Colorado's statute?",
      "Stevenson said it turns on whether the purpose of the treatment is to change the individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. If the patient wanted a counselor's help to become straight, that would be banned, she acknowledged, but if the patient were being advised on how to cope with his sexuality, that would be allowed.",
      "She argued that there are harms that result from conversion therapy, which posits that \"you can change this innate thing about yourself.\"",
      "Both Alito and Justice Elena Kagan raised the possibility that applying the statute could result in viewpoint discrimination. Kagan said that if we're in \"normal free speech-land \u2026 rather than in this kind of doctor-land,\" if the male in Alito's example identifies as gay and is told by a therapist that he'll be helped to accept that, that is acceptable. But if the male is told we're \"going to help you change,\" that is not.",
      "\"One of those is permissible and the other is not, that seems like viewpoint discrimination in the way we would normally understand viewpoint discrimination,\" she said.",
      "Stevenson said she agreed, but said it underscored why medical treatment has to be treated differently.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state have also warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts to take another look at the law.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "A few justices, including Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson, raised the idea of sending the case back to the lower courts to review the Colorado law under strict scrutiny, the most demanding level of judicial review. Why wouldn't we do that? Jackson asked Campbell.",
      "He responded that Chiles continues to suffer irreparable harm and \"is being silenced\" because of concerns she could violate Colorado's ban, while children who need help are \"being left without support.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DNI Tulsi Gabbard issued a directive to review polygraph policies and curb press leaks, echoing actions taken by the Bush and Obama administrations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard in the last month issued a memo ordering U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct a review of whether random polygraph examinations of their employees or contractors are feasible.",
      "At the same time, the directive emphasizes the need for tests to include questions about whether employees or potential applicants have leaked information to members of the press as part of the standard battery of questions during the security clearance adjudication process, CBS News has learned.",
      "While questions related to leaks have been commonplace for U.S. intelligence community employees and applicants, the Trump administration is intensifying efforts to curb disclosures of classified and sensitive information by warning intelligence community members they'll face additional scrutiny over leaks to media outlets. In many ways, Gabbard's directive echoes earlier hard-line stances undertaken by previous administrations of both political parties to root out sources of revelations that were either potentially damaging to national security or politically embarrassing.",
      "Two sources familiar with Gabbard's memo said that the directive emphasizes polygraph test questions related to leaks of information to the press and said the tests would become more routine in conjunction with counterintelligence investigations. The officials, who spoke to CBS News under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that while the U.S. government has a responsibility to safeguard its information, the mandate could stem the flow of information the public has the right to know, even if it's unclassified.",
      "An official with the Office of Director of National Intelligence, known as ODNI, told CBS News that while the directive does reinforce questions related to leaks to members of the press, Gabbard's memo does not establish new policies, but instead emphasizes existing regulations and legal statutes. The directive also does not direct agencies to begin random polygraph examinations but instead asks agencies within the U.S. intelligence community to review the feasibility of conducting random polygraphs in conjunction with counterintelligence investigations.",
      "The official said the review is based on internal U.S. intelligence community findings that indicated a lack of polygraph examinations has emboldened former U.S. intelligence community members to spy on behalf of U.S. adversaries. The ODNI official was unable to provide further details on the study or when it was conducted. The official emphasized that Gabbard's directive does not order additional screenings.",
      "Her directive is emblematic of a return to the aggressive approach taken under the Obama administration following the massive disclosure of classified information to journalists by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. In 2014, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper instructed federal agencies to question applicants and employees about whether they had shared classified material with the news media, according to the McClatchy news service, which obtained Clapper's policy directive under a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "Both the Obama and Bush administrations were heavily criticized for launching FBI investigations that targeted journalists' government sources and using the Espionage Act, a law enacted shortly after the U.S. entered World War I to prosecute spies and traitors, to successfully convict government officials who leaked confidential information to journalists. Both administrations ordered additional polygraph examinations and employed aggressive tactics to find leakers, seizing phone and email records of reporters and intelligence community members.",
      "\"Since the start of President Trump's second term, we have seen numerous unauthorized disclosures of classified information, which have the potential to damage U.S. strategic alliances and credibility and endanger sources and methods vital to intelligence gathering,\" DNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"The fact that deep state actors leaked information about DNI Gabbard's directive, aimed at preventing leaks and protecting classified information, to the media is both deeply ironic and a powerful reminder of why her efforts to identify and deter leakers is urgently necessary.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Gabbard said she made criminal referrals regarding two cases to the Justice Department, with a third on its way, which included an illegal leak of information to The Washington Post about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "While Gabbard's mandate reinforces policies implemented by previous administrations and existing legal statutes, it could generate a fresh round of criticism echoing what previous administrations faced over press freedoms and the relationship between journalists and government sources.",
      "Critics have historically argued that these types of policy directives are intended to create a chilling effect between national security reporters and U.S. government whistleblowers. Activists have said it's problematic to prosecute officials who leak to the press under the same law \u2014 the Espionage Act \u2014 used to prosecute spies and traitors.",
      "\"This is an obnoxious flexing of bureaucratic muscle by yet another Trump agency head seeking to intimidate and abuse their workforce. Gabbard has the authority to impose this requirement, but it's a serious waste of finite resources that will do little but force out a few officials and disrupt agency operations in the interim,\" Bradley Moss, a national security attorney, who specializes in national security and the security clearance process told CBS News.",
      "Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C., law office of Mark Zaid, whose clearance was stripped in March by President Trump following an executive order. Zaid, who filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in May to have his security clearance restored, had represented a whistleblower key to Mr. Trump's first impeachment.",
      "\"Everyone should keep an eye on those officials who are exempt from this requirement and how closely politically aligned they are with Gabbard,\" said Moss.",
      "Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported last week that the Pentagon is planning to implement widespread random polygraph testing while also requiring service members, civilian employees and contract workers within the Office of the Defense Secretary and the Joint Staff to sign a nondisclosure agreement, according to two unnamed people familiar with the proposal and documents obtained by the newspaper.",

      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Witkoff and Kushner were on hand to take part in the talks, which are focused on a plan proposed by Mr. Trump last week that aims to end the war in Gaza.",
      "The indirect talks, with Egypt and Qatar acting as intermediaries between Israel and Hamas, resumed on Tuesday for a second day in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh. They were being held as neighboring\u00a0Israel marked two years\u00a0since the Hamas attack that triggered the war.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told journalists that members of the U.S. delegation would join the talks on Wednesday.",
      "Senior officials from the U.S., Qatar and Turkey continue to arrive in Sharm el-Sheikh to join the negotiations, a senior Egyptian official involved in the talks told The Associated Press.",
      "The official said Hamas has demanded guarantees that Israel won't return to war after the release of the remaining 48 hostages who were taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive, closed-door negotiations.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war will only end when all the remaining hostages are returned and Hamas \u2014 which the U.S. and Israel consider to be a terrorist organization \u2014 has been disarmed. He has accepted Mr. Trump's plan, which calls for Gaza to be placed under international governance and for Hamas to be disarmed \u2014 demands that its leaders have yet to accept.",
      "The plan has received widespread international backing. Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that he thought there was a \"really good chance\" of a lasting deal.",
      "\"This is beyond Gaza,\" he said. \"Gaza is a big deal, but this is really peace in the Middle East.\"",
      "The plan envisions Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza after Hamas disarms, and an international security force being put in place. The territory would be placed under international governance, with Mr. Trump and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it.",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, Hamas reiterated its longstanding demands for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza but said nothing about disarmament.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Most have since been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "The war that has ensued has killed at least 67,160 Palestinians and left nearly 170,000 wounded, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, says more than half of the deaths were women and children.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the hostilities have created \"a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale that defied comprehension.\" Mr. Trump's proposal \"presents an opportunity that must be seized to bring this tragic conflict to an end,\" he said in a statement.",

      "Guevara landed in the South American country early Friday morning, just days after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that his\u00a0deportation could go forward.",
      "Speaking to CBS News Atlanta on Monday, Guevara said he was grateful to be out of ICE custody, but that the separation from his family has left him devastated.",
      "\"I was in jail 110 days, and now finally I'm not a prisoner anymore. I'm free, but I am away from my family. I am here, working in the area, trying to think about my situation,\" Guevara said. \"I have a second chance to be better, obviously, because I miss my family. I miss the United States.\"",
      "While in custody, Guevara said he was placed in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day. He said he lost weight and sank into a depression.",
      "\"In my mind, I believed the U.S. government is trying to destroy me. I have a lot of nightmares,\" he said. \"In my cell, I have the light on all day, 24 hours. I never know exactly what is the time until I ask someone. It's something horrible.\"",
      "He said when he was deported, he was given only his bulletproof vest, helmet, watch, and belt before being placed on the plane.",
      "\"The last minute before I left the plane in El Salvador airport, I turn around and I tell the officer, 'You deport me not for being a criminal. You deport me for being a journalist because I was working when you arrested me. I was working. You don't caught me committing a crime. I was working as a journalist,\" he said.",
      "Mario Guevara's reunion with his family",
      "Over the weekend, Guevara livestreamed his\u00a0reunion with his two sons, who had not been able to say goodbye to him before he was removed from the United States.",
      "Guevara acknowledged that the reunion was only temporary and that some members of his family remained in the United States and could only talk to him online.",
      "Now his family must decide whether to leave everything they've grown up accustomed to behind to join their father in El Salvador or stay apart from him.",
      "\"They destroyed my family,\" Guevara said. \"We are separated.\"",
      "While he waits for the future, Guevara says he will work telling stories in El Salvador, talking to others who were also deported. He posted photos of multiple suitcases filled with cameras and other equipment to continue his MG News channel. The employees of the channel will also continue to report on issues affecting metro Atlanta.",
      "\"The journalistic work continues,\" he said.",
      "What led to Mario Guevara's deportation",
      "Police in DeKalb County arrested Guevara while he was livestreaming a \"No Kings\" rally protesting President Trump's administration on June 14, charging him with obstructing police, unlawful assembly, and improperly entering a roadway.",
      "Within days, prosecutors dismissed the charges. The Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office then took out warrants charging Guevara with reckless driving and other counts, but the county's solicitor's office declined to prosecute the case.",
      "ICE took custody of Guevara a few days after his arrest and refused to release him. He was moved to the Folkston ICE Processing Center, where he remained in detention until his move to Louisiana and deportation.",
      "An immigration judge granted Guevara a $7,500 bond in July. The government then filed a stay, claiming that his reporting on law enforcement activity was dangerous, citing a 2012 ruling denying Guevara's application for asylum. Guevara had appealed that ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which hears appeals of immigration court rulings, but that appeal had not been decided when prosecutors agreed to administratively close the case.",
      "In September, the Board of Immigration reopened the immigration case and dismissed his appeal. Attorneys for Guevara and the ACLU have argued that the board based its ruling on incorrect information and that his deportation should not have been ordered.",
      "The Court of Appeals found that Guevara did have the First Amendment right to report on the protest, but had not filed the proper paperwork to apply for permanent residency, meaning that he could be removed from the country.",
      "Despite the deportation, Guevara is hopeful that he will be able to come back to the United States legally in the next few years.",
      "\"I think it's a mistake. An injustice, yes, but it's a mistake, and I hope to return soon,\" he said.",

      "A new intelligence bulletin published by a non-profit security organization warns that extremist groups are increasingly using artificial intelligence to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America.",
      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",
      "SCN analysts also found that in response to recent Israeli\u2013Iranian tensions, Iranian-sponsored AI-generated disinformation has surged, including fabricated images of attacks on Israel. The bulletin argues that these threats pose increased challenges for law enforcement and communal security, because AI tools are harder to trace and moderate in real time.",
      "According to the FBI, 2024 was recorded as the worst year for anti-Jewish hate crimes since federal law enforcement began reporting hate crime data in 1991. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, rising from 1,832 in 2023 to 1,938 in 2024.

    "summary": "Nobel Prize committee chair says discoveries by the trio of researchers were \"decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions.\"",
    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",
      "The trio will share the prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million).",

    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

    "story": [
      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",
      "It \"invites us to wonder what worlds beyond our own could be like during their nascent stages,\" she added.",
      "The observations were made by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile.",
      "The research also included data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Last week, the Webb telescope revealed a colorful spread of stars and cosmic dust in the Milky Way's most active star-forming region.",

    "story": [
      "The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus harbors complex organic molecules, a study said Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.",
      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that's headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.",

      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

    "summary": "ESO's Very Large Telescope has observed a rogue planet and revealed that it is eating up gas and dust from its surroundings at a rate of 6 billion tons a second.",
    "story": [
      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",
      "It \"invites us to wonder what worlds beyond our own could be like during their nascent stages,\" she added.",
      "The observations were made by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile.",
      "The research also included data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Last week, the Webb telescope revealed a colorful spread of stars and cosmic dust in the Milky Way's most active star-forming region.",

    "summary": "Preparing for the threats of tomorrow, the U.S. Air Force is testing drones piloted by artificial intelligence alongside aircraft flown by humans \u2013 and is teaching AI how to fight, a potential revolution in warfare.",
    "story": [
      "At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a test bed for a new kind of air force, Major Trent McMullen is a fighter pilot learning to fly alongside the XQ-58, a drone piloted by artificial intelligence. Think of this as \"Top Gun AI.\"",
      "\"I've flown safety chase on it for several missions, messaging back and forth with the autonomy on board,\" said McMullen.",
      "Maneuvering alongside an AI-piloted drone, he said, takes a bit of getting used to: \"As humans, we fly very smooth, but it can roll and fly a little bit snappier than maybe a human pilot would,\" McMullen acknowledged. \"It could be a little bit rougher a ride, but there's no human on board.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is on board, and now it is learning how to fight.",
      "McMullen said the tasks assigned to AI might be to intercept an adversary aircraft: \"So, we've been able to give it some of the basic blocking and tackling of air combat that we as human pilots also train on when we're first learning how to fly,\" he said.",
      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",
      "He says AI drones are capable of doing that today \u2013 and those drones could be armed with weapons.",
      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat. Those aircraft still have a cockpit, and a pilot, who can engage the plug-and-play AI system, and then remain on board as a safety pilot.",
      "\"So, once the AI goes on, the hands come off?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents.

      "The new system, the 10th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, was far from land. The hurricane center said Jerry was some 750 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the Caribbean chain east of Puerto Rico that starts with the Virgin Islands and extends down to Guadeloupe.",
      "Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph as it moved west-northwest at 23 mph across the open ocean, according to forecasters. It was expected to strengthen and become a hurricane on Thursday, meaning it would have minimum sustained winds of 74 mph.",
      "A tropical storm watch was in effect for Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, Saba and St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe and the islands adjacent to it.",
      "Maps show Jerry's path",
      "Jerry's core is forecast to be near or north of the northern Leeward Islands late Thursday and Friday, the hurricane center said. It wasn't\u00a0posing any threat to southern Florida.",
      "\"On Thursday into early Friday, two-to-four inches of rain are expected across the Leeward Islands due to Jerry,\" the center said. \"This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in areas of higher terrain.\"",
      "In addition, the center noted, Jerry-generated swells \"are expected to reach the Leeward and Windward Islands on Thursday, then spread westward toward the Greater Antilles on Friday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Hurricanes this season",
      "Jerry developed on the heels of several Atlantic storms, including Hurricane Humberto and Hurricane Imelda, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean.",
      "Humberto and Imelda also hit the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks to collapse.",
      "This has been a relatively quiet hurricane season, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others \u2014 Chantal \u2014 actually made landfall in the U.S.",
      "When the current season began, an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, NOAA revised its outlook in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes.",

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",

      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",

      "The bulletin, authored by Secure Communities Network, an independent organization dedicated to safeguarding the Jewish community in North America, outlines how both foreign terrorist organizations and domestic violent extremists are exploiting AI tools \u2013 including chatbots, deepfake imagery and generative content \u2013 in order to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors.",
      "The bulletin notes that as \"AI-generated content begins to create increasingly higher-quality images, the line between real and fake blurs,\" making false antisemitic material appear more credible.",
      "In one cited incident in July 2025, the chatbot \"Grok,\" which was created by Elon Musk's xAI, posted antisemitic and extremist content, including praise for Hitler and references to neo-Nazi rhetoric, following a system update.",
      "According to the report, the posting began when an X user made a post \"celebrating\" the deaths of children and counselors from Camp Mystic following the floods in Texas Hill Country over the July 4 weekend. \"After Grok was tagged to respond to the post, it made a remark about the poster's surname and used the phrase 'every damn time,'\" according to the bulletin, \"which is frequently leveraged by neo-Nazis as a way of accusing Jewish people of persistently being the cause of negative aspects of one's life.\"",
      "The bulletin also cites examples of violent acts not directly tied to antisemitism that allegedly used artificial intelligence to assist in planning an explosion, illustrating how artificial intelligence can aid operational tactics. When a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, the report noted, Matthew Livelsberger allegedly used the AI chat bot ChatGPT to assist in gathering information about explosives and planning the attack.",
      "At the time, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, stated, \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,\" later calling it, \"a concerning moment.\"",
      "SCN analysts also found that in response to recent Israeli\u2013Iranian tensions, Iranian-sponsored AI-generated disinformation has surged, including fabricated images of attacks on Israel. The bulletin argues that these threats pose increased challenges for law enforcement and communal security, because AI tools are harder to trace and moderate in real time.",
      "According to the FBI, 2024 was recorded as the worst year for anti-Jewish hate crimes since federal law enforcement began reporting hate crime data in 1991. Anti-Jewish incidents increased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, rising from 1,832 in 2023 to 1,938 in 2024.

      "Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released Tuesday. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.",
      "\"A turning point\" for global fossil fuel power generation",
      "The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power \u2014 even as demand for electricity skyrockets \u2014 with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.",
      "\"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,\" said Ma\u0142gorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.",
      "At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.",
      "\"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,\" said Wiatros-Motyka. \"This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.\"",
      "The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.",
      "Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.",
      "China and India leading the green energy transition",
      "Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.",

      "U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase",
      "In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.",
      "The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.",
      "Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy.

      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Indirect peace talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending the war in Gaza and freeing the remaining Israeli hostages resumed Wednesday in Egypt. President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were expected to arrive in Egypt on Wednesday to join the conversations, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Israeli officials believe 48 of those people remain captive, though only 20 are believed to still be alive.",
      "Since that day, the Gaza Strip's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says Israel's retaliatory war has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. Israel disputes that figure but provides no estimate of its own, and the United Nations considers the health ministry's count the most reliable information available, as Israel has barred foreign journalists from operating independently in Gaza.",
      "Ricardo Pires, a spokesman for the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, said this week that what he calls Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza has killed or maimed at least 61,000 children since the war started.",
      "UNICEF and the global charity Save the Children, which cited data compiled by the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office, say that on average, a child dies every hour in Gaza \u2014 or \"a classroom of children\" per day, as UNICEF put it.",
      "Since the war started, Save the Children says at least 20,000 kids have been killed in total \u2013 amounting to nearly a third of all Palestinians believed to have died in the war.",
      "UNICEF spokesman James Elder, told CBS News that when he visited one of Gaza's beleaguered hospitals this week, \"the first thing I saw was four children who had all been shot by quadcopters [military drones], then I went into a hallway and it was wall-to-wall children across all the corridors.\"",
      "\"There was a boy bleeding out on the floor who had apparently been there for five hours, then he was put on a stretcher only for another child to be put in his place,\" Elder told CBS News. \"Then I watched a little girl die. That's half an hour here in Gaza.\"",
      "The staggering death toll does not reflect the thousands more children who have been maimed and injured, or those who have lost one or both parents during the war.",
      "At a makeshift camp for Palestinian orphans in the southern city of Khan Younis, CBS News' team in Gaza saw some of the young faces behind the grim statistics.",
      "\"I wish the war were just a dream I'd wake up from and see my parents next to me,\" said 14-year-old Deena Al-Za'arab, who lost both of her parents.",
      "\"I have to keep it together for the sake of my siblings,\" she added, \"because now I must raise them.\"",
      "Many of the children at the camp now spend their days doing the work of adults.",

      "\"I just want to go back to how it used to be,\" she told CBS News. \"Whenever we heard the sound of missiles my father would hold us, but now he's gone, and we are always scared.\"",
      "UNICEF says one in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, and Elder stressed that the trauma being inflicted on the youngest is not just physical.",
      "\"The kids not only lost loved ones \u2014 it's not just about just having your mother killed, it's about watching your mother die, then add that level of trauma to being displaced \u2014 and we talk of displacement, it sounds like a neutral or abstract term. It's not. It's violent. It's repetitious, and it also increases trauma.\"",
      "The U.N. estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population, some 1.9 million people, have been forcibly displaced during the war, many of them multiple times as the focus of Israel's military operations has shifted. Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces ordered everyone to leave Gaza City, the enclave's biggest population center, and to move further south, to areas such as Khan Younis.",
      "It's led to another mass exodus, which aid workers say has increased the suffering in the region and made it harder to help those showing up, often with nothing.",
      "\"There have been several hundred thousands of people who have moved from the north recently, in the last few weeks,\" Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CBS News' Haley Ott on Wednesday.",
      "\"The situation was already very crowded,\" she said, speaking on the phone from central Gaza. \"They are now even more so. You can see a lot of people living on the side of the road, pitching tents on the sides of the roads \u2026 There are many people who fled on foot and, of course, were not able to bring anything with them, and this creates extremely difficult conditions in terms of hygiene, sanitation and these kinds of things.\"",
      "At the camp for the orphans \u2014 all of them among the displaced \u2014 12-year-old Gazal Basam told CBS News she felt \"such pain in my heart after losing my dad.\"",

      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",
      "Here's what to know about the Nobel Peace Prize and if Mr. Trump could receive it:",

      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump has also proposed a peace plan for Israel and Gaza, and spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week. Still, he told CBS News in September 2025 that he is not seeking the prize.",
      "\"I have nothing to say about it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"All I can do is put out wars.\" He added, \"I don't seek attention. I just want to save lives.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Trump was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP.",

Some 1,200 people were killed that day, most of them civilians, and 251 others taken hostage. Israeli officials believe 48 people are still being held captive in Gaza, only 20 of them believed to be alive.",
      "Their families are desperate for a deal to end the war and bring their loved ones home.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel were entering a second day in Egypt, spurred by President Trump's calls for both sides to agree to a ceasefire based on his recently announced 20-point peace proposal.",
      "Pressure has been mounting on Israel and Hamas not only from the White House but from around the world, with many of Israel's Arab neighbors pushing Hamas to accept a peace agreement and backing Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "In a message marking what he called \"the most brutal terrorist attack in Israel's history,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the U.S. government's \"unwavering support for Israel's right to exist, to defend itself, and to ensure the safety of its people.\"",
      "Rubio said the Trump administration was \"leading the effort to secure the release of all hostages, end Hamas's rule in Gaza, and advance a durable peace that ensures not only Israel's security, but generational peace and prosperity for the region.\"",
      "\"I have said it time and again, and I am repeating it today with even greater urgency: Release the hostages, unconditionally and immediately,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. \"Put an end to the hostilities in Gaza, Israel and the region now. Stop making civilians pay with their lives and their futures.\"",
      "The main Oct. 7 memorial event, in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, was organized by the bereaved families \u2014 not the government, reflecting deep divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership since the attack.",
      "Many Israelis blame him for failing to bring all the hostages home.",
      "\"We can't move on, we can't,\" said Eden Ganam, whose cousin, Yosef Ohana, is still in captivity in Gaza. \"This is not the same life that we had before October 7. \"We thought it would be maybe a month, a couple of days, but two years?\"",
      "The Hamas attack sparked Israel's ongoing, devastating war in the Gaza Strip. More than 67,000 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Huge swaths of the coastal enclave, home to more than 2 million people, have been destroyed.",
      "On Monday, the community of Nir Oz \u2014 where more than 400 residents were either killed or abducted \u2014 came together in song and prayer.",
      "Irit Lahav was hiding with her daughter in their safe room on that day two years ago.  \"We were holding hands, and we thought, 'That's it.  These are our last minutes,'\" she said. \"We just said loving words to each other. Goodbye words.\"",
      "Another memorial was set up Tuesday at the site of the Nova music festival, close to the Gaza border in the southern Israeli desert. It was overrun by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7 two years ago, and almost 380 people were killed.",
      "Orit Baron, whose daughter Yuval was among the festival goers killed that day, along with her fiance Moshe Shuva, told the French news agency AFP that she came to the site \"to be with her, because this is the last time that she was alive.\"",
      "Baron was among dozens of friends and relatives of those killed, and others just wishing to pay their respects. Many lit candles and stood for one minute in silence, remembering those lost to terrorism.",

      "The plan envisions Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza after Hamas disarms, and an international security force being put in place. The territory would be placed under international governance, with Mr. Trump and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it.",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, Hamas reiterated its longstanding demands for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza but said nothing about disarmament.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Most have since been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "The war that has ensued has killed at least 67,160 Palestinians and left nearly 170,000 wounded, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, says more than half of the deaths were women and children.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the hostilities have created \"a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale that defied comprehension.\" Mr. Trump's proposal \"presents an opportunity that must be seized to bring this tragic conflict to an end,\" he said in a statement.",

      "\"Then I understand that it is very severe, and it's not only missile attack. It's something much more complicated,\" Ben Ami said as Israel prepared to mark two years since the attack.",

      "Ben Ami was moved below ground, into the Hamas tunnel network, where he said there was no light, very little food, and the sanitary conditions were extremely poor.",

      "The United States has carried out at least four strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the waters off Venezuela in recent weeks, with at least two of the vessels originating from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela has accused the U.S. of military buildup and aggression, prompting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to place the country's military and civilians willing to take up arms on high alert.",
      "Stuck in the middle is Trinidad and Tobago, a nation with a multimillion-dollar fishing industry that employs thousands of fishermen who cast their nets almost daily to sustain themselves and their families.",
      "\"If we die, we die\"",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has said that drug cartels have contributed to pain and suffering in her country, and she has urged the U.S. to \"kill them all violently.\"",
      "She also said she is willing to grant the U.S. access to Trinidad and Tobago, if needed, so Americans can defend Guyana from neighboring Venezuela, which has claimed two-thirds of Guyana as its own.",
      "Maduro said that Persad-Bissessar's willingness to grant such access is like declaring war against Venezuela. The Venezuelan president has called for a return to good relations with its Caribbean neighbor, even as Trinidad and Tobago's government claims there's no bad blood between the countries.",
      "While those in authority trade words and military commanders ramp up their posturing, dozens of fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago feel their lives are at risk, given the ongoing U.S. strikes and escalation of tensions with Venezuela.",
      "\"If we die, we die, that's how this life is,\" Modie said.",
      "He fears being killed by a U.S. military strike while out fishing because he believes his boat could be mistaken for a drug-smuggling vessel. Modie said he hasn't seen substantial evidence that those killed in the U.S. strikes were indeed transporting drugs. He also worries about innocent fishermen being killed and falsely labelled as narco-terrorists by authorities, with the dead men being unable to clear their names.",
      "Fishing in fear",
      "Only seven miles separate Trinidad and Venezuela at their closest point. On a clear day, Venezuela is visible from the village of Icacos, which is located on Trinidad's southwestern tip.",
      "Driving around Icacos and neighboring Cedros village, dozens of boats strewn along the shoreline show how heavily these communities depend on fishing.",
      "Fishermen in these two villages say they are already under threat from pirates, and the military buildup at sea now adds yet another threat.",
      "Watching three other fishermen unload their catch for the day at the Cedros Fishing Complex, Kamal Bikeran said his crew now stays in shallower waters and isn't going as far out to sea as before, because of the tension involving the three countries.",
      "\"The U.S. has come there, and the Venezuelan military is saying they are more present, so you have to watch out,\" Bikeran said. \"At any point in time, outside there, you could be taken out.\"",
      "Forced to fish in shallower waters, Bikeran and other fishermen said the heightened regional tension is drying up their livelihoods, as they are now catching fewer fish.",
      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",
      "The president repeated that sentiment in remarks Sunday at an event celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, saying, \"We're so good at it that there are no boats. In fact, even fishing boats. Nobody wants to go into the water anymore.\"",
      "Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, Caribbean leaders referred to the region as a zone of peace.",
      "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley appealed for dialogue to avoid a war between the U.S. and Venezuela. The prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, described the foreign militarization of the waters near Venezuela as \"exceedingly troubling.\"",
      "Fishing in fear has become the new reality, said Shyam Hajarie, who has been a fisherman for more than 40 years. The Cedros native, like others, depends on his daily catches to support his family. He's unsure if the military buildup in the Caribbean would soon affect fish prices at the market.",
      "\"Just praying that everything works out with this situation with Venezuela and the U.S.,\" he said. \"That they make peace and not war.\"",

      "Guy Fieri first asked if the drivers of the trucks were okay after hearing the trucks had gone missing. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images for Los Santos: Santo Puro Mezquila)",
      "\"And he said, 'No, no, no, no, the trucks, it \u2014 they were appropriated, but we don't know where they are,'\" he continued. \"I'm like, it's not a needle in a haystack. I mean, this is a semi-tractor truck. My mind is swimming in exactly how do you lose, you know, that many thousands of bottles of tequila?\"",
      "More than 24,000 bottles of tequila went missing in November 2024, when two trucks transporting them to the Santo Tequila warehouse in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, were stolen. The tequila had been transported from Mexico to Texas, then loaded into two trucks bound for the warehouse.",
      "According to CEO Dan Butkus, when the shipment was late arriving at the warehouse, the team received word from the logistics company that the trucks had mechanical issues and would be delayed.",
      "The tequila was originally meant to arrive at the warehouse on a Wednesday, and on Friday they heard from the logistics company that the truck had broken down near Washington, D.C. They then received a video of a broken truck and a message saying the \"mechanics advised the truck will be fixed Saturday\" and would arrive on Monday.",
      "They originally thought the tequila was delayed due to a mechanical problem. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images for Los Santos: Santo Puro Mezquila)",
      "\"We don't think anything's wrong, we are a day or two behind delivery. And meanwhile, they track these with GPS,\" Butkus said. \"Then on Monday, we get an email that the truck is close. GPS says it's within a couple miles of our warehouse in Lansdale, can you let us know when it arrives?\"",
      "The trucks never arrived. The Santo Tequila team later discovered that the trucking company, hired by their logistics provider, had outsourced the job to two other trucking companies. Those turned out to be fake operations using fraudulent email addresses, letterheads and phone numbers \u2014 a scam known as \"double brokering.\"",

      "According to Keith Lewis \u2014 a former police officer who now works with law enforcement to crack down on these types of crimes through his company, Verisk CargoNet \u2014 these fake companies \"bid on jobs they suspected might be valuable and hired unsuspecting drivers online\" who think they are delivering their cargo to the intended destination.

      "Hagar told Fox News Digital in 2024, \"we\u2019ll never find the second one because it supposedly has been dispersed into the system.\"",
      "\"It's not a thing I wanna go and brag about, like, \u2018Hey, we got ripped off.\u2019 You know, that's not fun,\" Fieri told \"60 Minutes.\" \"But if it can happen to us with what I believe were pretty strong measures and security and awareness and, you know, communication and, you know, the way we do business.

    "summary": "The government shutdown enters its second week as Democrats demand an extension of enhanced ObamaCare subsidies set to expire in 2025, while conservatives oppose the measure.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on Day 6 of the government shutdown on 'Special Report.'",
      "The government has been shut down for a week and so far shows no clear sign of stopping, as Democrats continue to demand that any funding bill include an extension of enhanced ObamaCare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "But conservative groups are pushing back hard, arguing that those subsidies are fuel on the fire of higher healthcare premiums.",
      "\"What the Biden COVID credit did is they made the situation worse in two ways: They shifted a portion of the premium away from the enrollees to the taxpayer, and they brought more people into the subsidy structure by lifting the cap at four times the poverty line,\" Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"So if the underlying ObamaCare subsidies were inflationary, then the Biden enhancements to it just pour fuel on that underlying inflationary structure.\"",

      "The government is in a partial shutdown after Congress failed to reach an agreement on federal funding. (Getty Images)",
      "ObamaCare, formally called the Affordable Care Act (ACA), established a marketplace where healthcare insurers offer plans under certain rules set in place by the federal government, among other provisions. People and families are eligible for subsidies based on their income relative to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan, passed during the COVID-19 pandemic, expanded access so more Americans could qualify for subsidized ObamaCare plans while also lowering out-of-pocket costs. A Democrat-led Congress later extended those benefits to 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Now, however, Democrats are warning that many Americans' healthcare costs are at risk of drastically rising if those enhanced subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "But conservative groups who have long objected to ObamaCare's effects on the market are now arguing that the subsidies themselves have driven up the amount of money that healthcare companies charge for premiums.",
      "Brittany Madni, executive vice president at the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), told Fox News Digital, \"You do have patients who are still continuing to pay high prices, and a huge reason that they're paying higher prices is because the entire system has been artificially inflated by the unaffordable mandates in ObamaCare and the continued subsidies.\"",
      "\"The supersized COVID credit subsidies aren't reducing prices whatsoever. They're just adding funds to the insurance revenues,\" Madni said.",
      "ObamaCare did originally include a federal-level tax penalty for Americans who remained uninsured after its passage. That was repealed under the first Trump administration, but some states have levied their own penalties in its place.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, left, speaks to the media next to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the White House in Washington on Sept. 29, 2025.\u00a0 (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)",
      "But conservatives say rising healthcare costs have been most acutely felt by U.S. taxpayers rather than ObamaCare enrollees.",
      "\"When insurers increase premiums, the cost is not paid by the enrollee, it's paid by the taxpayer. So that gives insurers less incentive to negotiate lower prices with healthcare providers,\" he said.",
      "He said Biden's legislation \"made the situation worse because you make the taxpayer share even greater than it already was, and he lifted the cap at four times the poverty line, which brought more people into this subsidized market. So when you have all these people in a market where they don't care what the premiums are, that is, of course, going to be inflationary.\"",
      "Madni agreed that the COVID-era subsidies served to increase costs on taxpayers.",
      "\"What do you do if someone who is younger and healthier is choosing not to go into the risk pool and therefore driving up the overall cost of the risk, all because now it's just full of sick people instead of healthy people in the middle?\" You offer the plans for such a low rate that it seems silly not to jump into the deal,\" she said. \"You can't actually get rid of the cost. You can only shift the cost. So it shifts from the enrollees who are in the risk pool to taxpayers.\"",
      "House Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., whose committee has jurisdiction over the enhanced subsidies, told Fox News Digital, \"Democrats are doubling down on their failure to reduce the cost of healthcare, with premiums for ObamaCare marketplace plans increasing 80% since they were created a decade ago.\"",
      "\"When it comes to healthcare, Americans are paying more but getting less, paying higher deductibles, having their claims denied, and unable to see their doctor while insurers profit from generous taxpayer subsidies handed to them by Washington Democrats,\" Smith said.",

      "But outside conservative circles, people in the healthcare sphere argue that Americans will feel financial pain if the subsidies expire and deny the COVID-era enhancements' contribution to inflated prices.",
      "Cynthia Cox, who oversees ObamaCare research for KFF \u2014 an independent health policy research, polling and news organization \u2014 said that extending the subsidies would cost more taxpayer dollars but that they did not raise costs for insurers or enrollees.",
      "\"I think from a taxpayer perspective or from a federal spending perspective, they certainly do raise costs,\" Cox said. \"But from an insurance perspective, they bring down average cost and, from an enrollee perspective, it also brings down the cost that they're paying.\"",

      "DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO BUDGE OVER OBAMACARE FIGHT AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON",
      "\"The tax credits do not have an inflationary effect on insurance premiums. In fact, they help keep they have a downward effect on insurance and the amount that the insurance company is charging,\" Cox told Fox News Digital.",
      "She pointed to the ACA's protections for people with preexisting conditions, such as bans on insurance companies denying coverage or charging more based on individuals' health, as potential drivers of healthcare cost inflation.",
      "\"But then the tax cuts are meant to kind of offset that by reducing how much individuals pay and subsidizing them,\" Cox explained.",
      "\"The idea is that it will make health insurance more attractive to healthier people, so therefore would not wait until they get sick to get coverage. They would start paying into the insurance pool when they're healthier, and then that brings down the overall average premium that insurers charge.\"",

      "There are four common types of inheritance traps that use probate records as sources for their fraudulent claims:",
      "The fake fee scam: Just like the\u00a0DMV notice scam that claims the recipient has unpaid toll fees, scammers use probate data to pose as attorneys or court officials, claiming heirs owe fees to release inheritance funds. They create urgency with threats of legal action or frozen assets, demanding payment via wire transfer or gift cards.",
      "The fake debt collector: Fraudsters send texts or make AI-generated voice calls, claiming that the deceased person owed debts that have to be settled immediately. They often have enough information from probate records to sound legitimate, pressuring families to pay non-existent debts.",
      "The fake estate service: Scams that offer seemingly helpful services like \"property appraisals,\" \"finding hidden assets,\" or \"estate clean-out services\" can look like they offer reasonable deals. Some take payment and disappear\u2014others perform unnecessary services that families never requested.",
      "Cyberguy lays out ways to avoid inheritance scams. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "The \"advanced fee\" gift: Anyone who promises to expedite probate proceedings or secure larger inheritances for an upfront fee is probably in it to win it (for themselves). Some cases even involve disgruntled family members acting out of greed. These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money. If someone claims you have an inheritance coming, but they need \"a fee to unlock it\" or they promise to \"handle your probate case\" for a small upfront fee, you guessed it \u2014 nothing ever comes from it.",
      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines. When something demands immediate action, victims feel compelled to respond before verifying claims or consulting attorneys, which is exactly what fraudsters count on.",

      "The good news is that with awareness and a few smart steps, you can lower your risk of falling victim to inheritance scams.",
      "Never send money or give information to an unsolicited contact about an estate. If someone claims you owe fees or have obligations, independently verify their identity or company. Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",
      "In most jurisdictions, you can't prevent a probate filing from going public. But you can minimize additional data exposure by not sharing anything on social media and limiting contact to only key parties that you trust with financial information.",
      "Data removal services specialize in removing personal information from data broker sites that scammers use to supplement probate data. Personal information combined with probate records create the perfect setup for inheritance traps\u2014scammers can make super-convincing, alarmist content that can bypass your intuition about scams, especially during times of grief.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Ensure elderly relatives or those less familiar with scam tactics understand these risks. Scammers often target multiple heirs, seeking the most vulnerable respondent.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The probate system creates a privacy trade-off. You can't prevent much of this information from entering the public record, but you can control how you respond, and how much personal data is out there. Any probate topics should come through official court channels, and never an unsolicited phone call, email or text message. When in doubt, verify with your probate court, and always consult your estate attorney. With a little vigilance and a bit of data cleanup, you can ensure that the probate process doesn't put you in harm's way, during the time when you're at your most vulnerable.",

      "Automotive giant Stellantis has just revealed that it suffered a data breach, exposing customer contact details, after attackers infiltrated a third-party platform used for North American customer services. The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions. These earlier incidents exposed names, emails and phone numbers, which were sufficient for attackers to launch phishing campaigns or extortion attempts.",

      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "What you need to know about the Stellantis breach",
      "Stellantis was formed in 2021 through the merger of the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",
      "Stellantis has not revealed how many customers the breach affected. The company also has not specified which contact fields, such as email, phone, or address, attackers accessed.",
      "The alleged culprit, ShinyHunters, and Salesforce breaches",
      "While Stellantis has not explicitly named the hacker group behind the breach, multiple sources tie this incident to the ShinyHunters extortion campaign, which has spearheaded a wave of data thefts targeting Salesforce this year.",
      "ShinyHunters claims to have stolen over 18 million records from Stellantis' Salesforce instance, which includes names and contact details, according to Bleeping Computer. These attacks form part of a broader campaign aimed at Salesforce customers. In recent months, ShinyHunters has often worked in concert with groups like Scattered Spider and targeted companies including Google, Cisco, Adidas, Allianz Life, Qantas and brands under LVMH such as Dior and Tiffany & Co.",

      "The attack is linked to a wider wave of Salesforce data thefts this year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Their reported method is fairly ingenious. Attackers exploit OAuth tokens tied to integrations like Salesloft's Drift AI chat tool to pivot into Salesforce environments. Once inside, they can harvest valuable metadata, credentials, AWS keys, Snowflake tokens and more.",
      "In fact, the FBI recently issued a Flash alert that surfaced numerous indicators of compromise linked to these Salesforce environment attacks and warned organizations to harden defenses. The cumulative toll is staggering. ShinyHunters asserts it has stolen over 1.5 billion Salesforce records across some 760 companies.",

      "Even if only contact details were exposed, that's enough for attackers to target you. Here's how to stay protected.",
      "Even basic contact details can be scraped from breaches and sold on data broker platforms, where they are used for spam, scams and targeted attacks.

      "Stolen emails and phone numbers could fuel phishing campaigns. (REUTERS /Rebecca Cook)",
      "The most immediate risk after a breach like this is targeted phishing. Attackers now have legitimate contact details, so their emails and texts can look convincingly real. Be skeptical of any message claiming to be from Stellantis, your car brand or a related service, especially if it urges you to click a link, download an attachment or share personal details.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If attackers get your contact information, they may try the same password on other sites. This is called credential stuffing. A password manager can create strong, unique passwords for every account. That way, one breach will not put your other accounts at risk. It also helps you quickly update credentials in case you suspect a compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "2FA adds an extra step to your logins by requiring a temporary code or approval in addition to your password. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they will need that second factor to gain access. This significantly reduces the chances of account takeover attempts succeeding.",
      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "After a breach, it is worth auditing your accounts, not just with Stellantis but also with related services such as financing portals, insurance accounts or loyalty programs. Look for unusual sign-ins, unfamiliar devices, or changes to your personal details. Most services offer tools to review login history and security events, making checking these a routine habit.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Even giants in manufacturing are vulnerable when cloud platforms and third-party systems are part of their customer workflow. The same patterns seen in attacks on Google, LVMH and others have now reached the auto industry in a serious way. As Stellantis confronts the fallout, the broader lesson is clear. Organizations must treat the surfaces exposed by their service providers and SaaS integrations with as much vigilance as their own core systems.",

      "WHY IPHONE USERS ARE THE NEW PRIME SCAM TARGETS",
      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",
      "SHAMOS MALWARE TRICKS MAC USERS WITH FAKE FIXES",
      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Even Apple\u2019s built-in protections can miss new or advanced threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do if your Mac is already infected",
      "If you find yourself dealing with a Mac that's already compromised, these steps can help you get back in control:",
      "Unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This prevents malware from sending more data out or pulling in additional malicious code.",
      "Use an external drive or cloud service you trust. Avoid copying entire system folders \u2013 just grab personal documents, photos and files you can't replace. You don't want to back up the malware along with them.",
      "Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key. Safe Mode prevents some malware from launching and makes it easier to run cleanup tools.",
      "While macOS includes XProtect, you may need something more powerful. A strong antivirus program can detect and remove infections. Run a full system scan to catch hidden threats.",
      "5 PHONE SETTINGS TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW FOR A SAFER SMARTPHONE",
      "Review what apps are set to launch at startup and remove anything you don't recognize. If you spot unfamiliar processes hogging resources, don't just guess. Use our guides at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech to compare what's safe and learn how to shut down anything suspicious before it causes more trouble.",
      "If malware persists, wiping your system may be the only option. Erase your Mac's drive and reinstall macOS from scratch. Restore only the clean files you backed up earlier.",
      "If your iPhone, iPad or other personal devices are showing strange behavior, run security scans, update their software and reset key passwords. Malware can sometimes spread through shared Wi-Fi networks, cloud accounts or files.",
      "Even after cleanup, assume some of your data may have been exposed. Update your Apple ID, email, banking and work accounts with strong, unique passwords. Turn on\u00a02FA\u00a0wherever possible.",
      "If you're overwhelmed, you can bring your Mac to an Apple Store for in-person help at the Genius Bar, or schedule a free appointment with Apple Support.",
      "Simple steps like scanning, updating and using strong passwords can keep your data safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 ways to keep your Mac from getting infected",
      "Some cyber threats do not reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they have stolen. These steps can help you strengthen your defenses and reduce the chances of future infections.",
      "macOS's built-in protections are useful but basic. A strong antivirus adds an extra layer by detecting threats in real time, blocking malicious downloads and even identifying new types of malware before they spread. A strong antivirus also scans email attachments and browser activity, areas where many Mac users are most vulnerable.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Many cyberattacks begin with information freely available online.

While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Many malware attacks rely on stolen credentials rather than technical exploits.

      "Even if someone steals your password,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) makes it much harder for them to access your accounts. It adds an extra step to the login process, requiring a code from your phone or a security key.",
      "Outdated software is a common entry point for malware. Updates often patch vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, so turning on automatic updates for both macOS and third-party apps is an easy but effective defense.",
      "Malware often tries to run at startup so it can operate undetected. Regularly check System Settings to make sure only trusted apps are launching automatically, and use Activity Monitor to investigate anything suspicious.",
      "If your personal data has already been exposed, an identity theft protection service can monitor for suspicious activity, alert you to breaches and help you recover quickly if something does go wrong. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",
      "\"Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls. The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact and spent less time on Instagram at night. Parents also have robust tools at their fingertips, from limiting usage to monitoring interactions. We'll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback. But this report is not that.\"",

      "The program has already reached hundreds of thousands of students, with a goal of teaching one million middle school students in the coming year.

Students benefit too, with a curriculum designed to give them practical tools for navigating online life safely.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Meta's expansion of Teen Accounts marks a major shift in how social platforms approach safety. By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "How the FileFix attack works",
      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",
      "Acronis reported that the campaign has already appeared in several different versions over a short period, with changes in payloads and infrastructure. This suggests that the attackers are actively testing and refining their methods to avoid detection and improve success rates.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from FileFix attacks",
      "To stay protected against attacks like FileFix and prevent malware such as StealC from stealing sensitive information, you need to combine caution with practical security measures. The following steps can help safeguard accounts, devices, and personal data.",
      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus software can detect malware like StealC before it fully executes. Many solutions now include behavior-based detection that can flag suspicious scripts or hidden downloads, helping catch threats even when attackers try to disguise commands as harmless actions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Google has released an urgent update for its Chrome browser to fix a newly discovered zero-day security flaw that hackers are already exploiting. This is the sixth zero-day Chrome has faced this year, highlighting just how quickly attackers move to take advantage of these hidden weaknesses.",

      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Chrome users are urged to update immediately to block active zero-day attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A critical flaw in Chrome's V8 engine",
      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",
      "The fix was delivered through Chrome version 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows and macOS, and version 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. These updates will gradually reach all users in the Stable Desktop channel over the coming weeks.",
      "While Chrome typically updates automatically, you can apply the patch immediately by navigating to the \u2018About Google Chrome\u2019 section. Google stated that it is withholding full technical details until most users have installed the update, a precaution meant to prevent attackers from exploiting lagging systems.",

      "This marks the sixth zero-day flaw patched in Chrome this year. In March, Google addressed CVE-2025-2783, a sandbox escape bug exploited in espionage attacks against Russian organizations. In May, it pushed emergency updates for CVE-2025-4664, which let attackers hijack user accounts.",
      "Then in June, another flaw in the V8 engine, CVE-2025-5419, was patched after being spotted by TAG. July saw the release of a fix for CVE-2025-6558, which allowed attackers to bypass Chrome's sandbox protection.

      "Updating Chrome is essential, but there are additional steps you can take to stay safe from attacks.",
      "Many zero-day attacks are delivered through malicious websites or email attachments. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from unverified sources, especially if they prompt you to disable security settings. Also, use strong antivirus software to add another layer of defense to detect malicious code that tries to run through compromised browsers. A strong antivirus can spot suspicious activity before it takes hold. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Even if attackers manage to steal your login details through a browser exploit,\u00a02FA makes it much harder for them to break into your accounts. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS when possible for stronger protection.",
      "If attackers exploit the browser to steal login data, a password manager keeps your credentials safe and helps generate unique, complex passwords. Even if one account is targeted, it prevents a domino effect across your logins.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Some extensions can be abused to make attacks worse. Stick to extensions from trusted developers, review permissions carefully and uninstall anything you no longer need.",
      "Chrome updates are critical, but attackers can also exploit holes in Windows, macOS, Android or iOS. Regular OS updates patch vulnerabilities across the system, reducing the chances of a browser exploit spreading further.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

      "\"We focused on those individuals that carried illegal handguns\u2026 they were not allowed to have a gun,\" Bates said. \"Forty percent of that group were victims of murders, but they were also the perpetrators of murders. If they're not here right now in the community, now they cannot be victims of murders and they cannot [be] the murderers.\"",
      "According to data from the Baltimore Police Department, homicides fell 23% by year end of 2024 (201 vs. 261 in 2023) and non-fatal shootings dropped 34% (414 vs. 635). BPD also reported clearance rates above national averages in several categories.",
      "The data also showed that through June 30, 2025, homicides were down 22% (68 vs. 88) and non-fatal shootings down 19% (164 vs. 204). BPD reported a 64% homicide clearance rate and 44% non-fatal shooting clearance rate, plus over 1,300 firearms seized, including 150 ghost guns.",
      "City officials emphasize that while murders and shootings are dropping, work remains to reduce other categories of violence and crime.",
      "\"Our continued progress is the direct result of the comprehensive, evidence-based public safety strategy that we have implemented in partnership with residents,\"\u00a0Mayor Brandon M. Scott said in a news release. \"While we acknowledge the historic lows we are experiencing, we must simultaneously acknowledge that there is much more work to do, and our success makes me commit even further to doing it.\"",
      "For decades, Bates said that Baltimore\u2019s justice system had a reputation for leniency, but now, that has changed.",
      "\"There is no magic pill. You just have to really hold people accountable,\" he explained. \"When they know that they will go to jail, their attitudes change greatly.\"",

      "\"People have hope\u2026 we're moving in the right direction\u2026 especially when it comes to violent crime,\" he said. \"We need more individuals moving to Baltimore and not moving out\u2026 The number one thing is we have to focus on safety.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke with Cornell law professor William Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, following the two-year remembrance of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.",
      "Two years after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel, antisemitic \"venom\" infecting America\u2019s colleges hasn\u2019t faded \u2013 it\u2019s evolved, a professor said.",
      "The protests may have quieted, but \"venomous\" hatred has gone underground, and it\u2019s spreading through classrooms, faculty lounges, and student groups, William Jacobson, a Clinical Professor of Law at Cornell Law School, said.",
      "He says universities have learned to\u00a0mask the problem, cracking down on encampments and visible disruptions while the ideology driving the hate has only hardened.",
      "\"There has been a gross campaign at the international level to demonize Israel,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"False accusations of genocide. These are all percolating under the surface on the campuses. In some ways, the situation\u2019s worse underneath.\"",

      "He argues that the same ideas that fueled the pro-Hamas protests of 2023 have now been absorbed into campus culture, where they are \"more organized, more coordinated, and more dangerous\" than before.",
      "\"People should not be complacent that these issues were brewing before October 7th,\" he warned. \"They\u2019ve been pushed now back below the surface, but it\u2019s still brewing on campuses and nobody should kid themselves.\"",
      "He also accused elite universities of\u00a0stalling the federal crackdown on campus antisemitism, saying they are \"playing hide-and-seek\" with the Department of Education's investigations, and are betting they can simply outlast them.",
      "\"I think the schools think they can outlast the Trump administration,\" said Jacobson. \"That they can rope-a-dope it for two to three more years. And then perhaps they'll be rescued by a new administration.\"",
      "He said many top universities care less about donor backlash and more about protecting the billions in federal funding that keep them afloat.",
      "\"They take a longer-term view. They think this is going to blow over,\" he said. \"For every alum who withholds a contribution because of anti-Israelism on campus, there's probably another, probably a foreign donor, who makes up for it.\"",
      "\"What they do care about is federal funding, because federal funding is on a scale that so far surpasses private donations that it's something they can't ignore,\" he continued. \"If Trump ends up prevailing in a lot of these lawsuits, and I believe he will, that\u2019s going to put certain schools in a very bad situation.\"",
      "At Harvard University, federal officials have recently renewed efforts to limit the school\u2019s eligibility for certain research grants and new government contracts, according to a recent Fox News Digital report. The Trump administration has argued that universities found to have violated anti-discrimination laws should not receive federal funding.",

      "\"People were marching, calling for an Intifada. People were marching, celebrating October 7th,\" he said. \"Let\u2019s not forget, in many ways, the most important day for campuses was not October 7th \u2013 it was October 8th.\"",
      "That next day, he said, some faculty members began\u00a0openly excusing Hamas\u2019 actions as part of \"decolonization.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s when [the] faculty started to make excuses for what Hamas and the Palestinians had done,\" he said. \"There was open sympathy for it. There was talk about, well, what did you think decolonization really means? It\u2019s not just class papers \u2014 it\u2019s a revolution.\"",
      "He pointed to examples at Harvard University and Cornell University, where one professor admitted he felt \"exhilarated\" after the attack before later walking the comment back.",
      "\"That nastiness that was there on October 7th and 8th is still there,\" he said. \"But it\u2019s in some ways even worse because there are organized attempts to spread that sort of venom throughout the campuses.\"",
      "He dismissed claims that universities are punishing students for their political views, saying the real issue is\u00a0uneven enforcement of conduct rules.",
      "\"A lot of people say Palestinian students are being suspended for their speech. No, they're not,\" Jacobson said. \"They're being suspended because they take over the library. They disrupt people. They intimidate people. It's conduct that they're engaged in.\"",

      "The professor said that despite public statements, few universities have truly reckoned with how antisemitism became normalized in their classrooms and administrative culture.",

      "A White House official told Fox News Digital that Kushner, a \"major architect of the Abraham Accords,\" is an \"extremely trusted voice on Middle East policy\" and has been in contact with Witkoff throughout the Israel-Hamas negotiations over the last year.",

Two: they're bringing some pretty serious firepower to make some deals,\" Rebeccah Heinrichs, senior fellow and director of the\u00a0Hudson Institute\u2019s Keystone Defense Initiative, told \"Fox and Friends\" Wednesday morning.",
      "\"It's promising that Jared is there,\" Heinrichs added, noting his prominent role in securing the Abraham Accords during the first Trump administration.",

      "As\u00a0President Donald Trump moves to finalize his 20-point plan to end the Gaza war, Israel faces a pivotal decision that could reshape the conflict\u2019s aftermath. The framework envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the return of all hostages, and a major prisoner exchange. In return, Hamas would commit to disarmament and allow a technocratic transitional authority to manage Gaza\u2019s reconstruction.",
      "Part of the agreement involves releasing hundreds of convicted Palestinian terrorists, a clause that has already triggered backlash from the families of victims.",
      "Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Moshe Dayan Forum at Tel Aviv University and one of Israel\u2019s foremost experts on Hamas, told Fox News Digital that the list of roughly 250 prisoners contains names that represent what he called \"a real strategic danger.\"",

      "Palestinian Hamas terrorists stand guard on the day of the handover of hostages held in Gaza since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack, as part of a ceasefire and a hostages-prisoners swap deal between Hamas and Israel, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 22, 2025.\u00a0 (Reuters/Hatem Khaled/File Photo)",
      "\"These are not low-level activists,\" Milshtein said. \"Among them are people who built power and influence inside prison. When released, they will return as leaders.\"",
      "He cited several examples that, he said, demonstrate the risk of past exchanges. Among the prisoners now under discussion are Abbas al-Sayed, convicted for the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya that killed 30 people; Ibrahim Hamed, former Hamas military commander in the West Bank, serving more than 40 life sentences; Abdullah Barghouti, who produced explosives for a series of large-scale suicide bombings and Hassan Salameh, convicted for orchestrating multiple bus attacks in the 1990s.",
      "Ibrahim Hamed, a former head of the Hamas terrorist movement in the West Bank, looks on as he arrives for sentencing at the Ofer military court near Ramallah, West Bank, on July 1, 2012. The Israeli military court sentenced Hamed to 54 life terms after convicting him of ordering attacks that killed dozens of Israelis, the army said.",
      "\"These are people with dozens of life sentences,\" Milshtein explained. \"We\u2019ve already seen what happens when such figures are freed. Many of those who carried out the Oct. 7 massacre were prisoners released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal.\"",
      "ISRAELI VICTIMS OF TERROR CONCERNED WITH MURDERERS' RELEASE FROM PRISON, RELIEVED 7 HOSTAGES BACK HOME",
      "Milshtein noted that several\u00a0recently released prisoners have quickly rejoined Hamas\u2019s leadership abroad. He pointed to Abdel Nasser Issa, a Hamas operative convicted in 1995 who was released earlier this year and soon relocated to Turkey, where he began appearing in podcasts as part of the group\u2019s senior political echelon. \"That is the model,\" Milshtein said. \"They enter prison as operatives and emerge as decision-makers.\"",
      "Among the most concerning names, he added, is Jamal Al-Hur, who he described as \"one of the five most dangerous.\" Al-Hur, deeply connected to Hamas\u2019s hierarchy, has served nearly three decades in prison and now acts as a key liaison between jailed operatives and the group\u2019s external leadership. \"He didn\u2019t enter as a leader but became one inside,\" Milshtein said. \"If released, he will re-establish himself quickly\u2014just as others did before him.\"",

      "Sharon Edri is seen here with his sister, Danielle Edri Karten. Edri Karten opposes the release of her brother's killer.",
      "\"He kidnapped, mutilated, tortured my uncle,\" said Izzy Karten, Edri\u2019s nephew, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital from New York. \"He went to jail, was released, and went on to commit the Apropo Caf\u00e9 bombing.

      "\"I appreciate that Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing in order to give the Hostage release and Peace Deal a chance to be completed. Hamas must move quickly, or else all bets will be off,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again.

      "This week\u2019s staffing shortages began on Monday, when air traffic controllers started working without pay due to the shutdown.",
      "The federal agency said Wednesday morning that it expects staffing triggers at Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the three major airports in the New York City metropolitan area. The trigger would reduce the number of flights in and out of the airport to accommodate traffic safely with lower-than-ideal staffing levels.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/marjorie-taylor-greene-increasingly-bucking-party-trump-rcna236288",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "From the Gaza war to the Epstein files to the government shutdown, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has grown critical of her fellow Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "When the White House discouraged Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from launching a Senate bid in Georgia this spring, Greene \u2014 a longtime loyal ally of President Donald Trump \u2014 agreed to back off her statewide ambitions.",
      "But that didn\u2019t mean the firebrand Republican was going to back down from other fights she felt were worth waging \u2014 including, or perhaps especially, with her own party.",
      "Over the past six months, Greene has made waves in Washington for publicly breaking with Trump and the GOP on a number of high-profile issues and lobbing some pointed attacks at her fellow Republicans in the process. She was critical of the Trump administration\u2019s strikes on Iran, referred to the situation in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide,\u201d signed her name to an effort to force a House vote to require the Justice Department to release its files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case and, most recently, sided with Democrats in calling for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies amid the government shutdown fight.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not some sort of blind slave to the president, and I don\u2019t think anyone should be,\u201d Greene said in an interview. \u201cI serve in Congress. We\u2019re a separate branch of the government, and I\u2019m not elected by the president. I\u2019m not elected by anyone that works in the White House. I\u2019m elected by my district. That\u2019s who I work for, and I got elected without the president\u2019s endorsement, and, you know, I think that has served me really well.\u201d",
      "Greene won her first House primary in Georgia in 2020 without Trump\u2019s endorsement before she received his support in the general election in her deep-red district.",
      "\u201cSo I get to be independent as a Republican,\u201d she added, \u201cand I think what helps [Trump] the most is when he has people that are willing to be honest with him and not just tell him what they think he wants to hear.\u201d",
      "Greene denies that her statewide ambitions\u2019 being dashed has anything to do with her recent independent streak, saying that has always been her brand. She also slammed the Republican-led Senate, insisting she was never all that interested in serving there anyway, even though she had publicly talked about her desire to run.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to serve in that institution. Look at them. They\u2019re literally the reason why the government is shut down right now,\u201d Greene said. \u201cI think all good things go to die in the Senate, and I certainly don\u2019t want to go there. But I think those are just attacks to try to marginalize me or try to sweep me off, so to speak. And I really don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "While Greene has been a solo operator in the past, her recent behavior has surprised even some people who are close to her. She tried on the role of \u201cteam player\u201d for a while, especially when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was in charge. But she has grown increasingly disillusioned with politics and her own party, and she felt especially burned after the White House talked her out of running for the Senate, according to four Republican sources familiar with the matter.",
      "One of those sources, who is close to Greene \u2014 who openly expressed interest in becoming homeland security secretary \u2014 said she was also disappointed she didn\u2019t get a job in the Trump administration. Another one of the sources, who is also close to Greene and spoke to her recently, added that she has felt \u201cignored\u201d by GOP leadership and the White House.",
      "If Greene\u2019s intentions were to get Trump\u2019s attention, it appears to have worked. In recent months, he called at least two senior Republicans to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Marjorie?\u201d according to two GOP sources with direct knowledge of the conversations.",
      "Greene, who is arguably more in tune with the MAGA base than any other member of Congress, says she still supports Trump and maintains close ties with him. But her relationship with his staff is a different story.",
      "The White House has unsuccessfully tried to pressure Greene to remove her name from the Epstein discharge petition. Greene was particularly incensed when she read an anonymous White House official told reporters that supporting the petition would be seen as a \u201chostile act.\u201d She then went on Real America\u2019s Voice and called that official a \u201ccoward.\u201d",
      "In what some Republicans viewed as another sign of Greene\u2019s shifting attitude toward the political scene, she was invited last month to attend the grand opening of Trump\u2019s \u201cRose Garden Club\u201d at the White House, but she turned it down, according to a source familiar with the matter. It was the type of exclusive Trump event that Greene would normally have cleared her schedule to attend. Her office said she was under the weather.",
      "Greene also has a strained relationship with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whom she feels zero loyalty to and tried unsuccessfully to remove from his post last year over his support for Ukraine aid.",
      "Unlike McCarthy, who strategically brought Greene into the fold so he could better control her behavior, Johnson hasn\u2019t made the same overtures. Greene was a pariah when she first came to Congress for her incendiary rhetoric, so she was eager to prove herself and play the inside game. But now, she is increasingly embracing her outsider status.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t run for Congress as an establishment Republican, and when I ran for Congress, I\u2019d never even been to a GOP meeting. So I didn\u2019t come up through the ranks,\u201d Greene said. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand that. I\u2019m very much an average American. I don\u2019t see things through the party polls and the talking points; I look at the real problems and analyze them that way. ... So I think that helps me have a different viewpoint.\u201d",
      "In calling for an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies, Greene cited her own children as an example of how people are going to be hurt if Republicans let them lapse. Greene said she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the prospect even though she doesn\u2019t like the underlying law, and she criticized GOP leadership for not having a plan to address it.",
      "Democrats were quick to seize on her comments to bolster their argument. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cited them on the Senate floor, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., even put her social media post about the topic on a poster board and took it to a news conference.",
      "At his own news conference Tuesday, Johnson dismissed Greene\u2019s criticism of the party\u2019s approach on Obamacare subsidies, arguing she isn\u2019t informed about the topic.",
      "\u201cCongresswoman Greene does not serve on the committees of jurisdiction that deal with that, those specialized issues, and she\u2019s probably not read in on some of that,\u201d he said.",
      "But Greene hasn\u2019t budged in the face of criticism from party leadership.",
      "\u201cThe reality is they never talk about it, and that committee working on, say, health insurance and the industry, that doesn\u2019t happen in a [secure facility]; it\u2019s not a major secret,\u201d Greene said, adding that Johnson has yet to reach out to her to discuss her concerns.",
      "\u201cWhat I am upset over is my party has no solution,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we talk about frequently, but it is a reality for Americans, and it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think we can ignore. I want, I really want to fix it.\u201d",
      "Now that she has given up on running for the Senate next year and was passed over for a Trump administration job, it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s in store for Greene\u2019s political future. She raised $1.3 million in the first six months of the year, slightly less than the $1.9 million she had brought in at the same point in 2023, and she has only $641,000 cash on hand.",
      "Asked whether she\u2019s committed to running for re-election in the House next year, Greene said: \u201cOh, certainly. I haven\u2019t made any things like that. I don\u2019t, honestly, I don\u2019t even think about it. Right now, I\u2019m just like, damn it, why aren\u2019t we back at work?\u201d"

      "None of it has seemed to matter for the stock market. At least not yet.",
      "Stocks closed moderately lower Tuesday, but it was the first down day in more than a week. The broad S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes have seen more than 30 record closes this year. The major indexes were essentially flat Wednesday morning.",
      "With other parts of the economy showing strain, the market gains are fueling concerns about an economy in which the wealthiest U.S. households continue to thrive even as lower- and middle-income families languish.",
      "\u201cIt points out the bifurcation of the economy,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group.",
      "Two forces have been driving much of the market\u2019s recent runup: artificial intelligence investments, and the prospect of lower interest rates.",
      "Sosnick pointed to calculations showing that spending on building out AI infrastructure, like data centers, is now responsible for an enormous part of economic growth this year.",
      "That spending hasn\u2019t led to much new job creation in the overall economy: 2025 is on pace to be one of the worst years for new payrolls added this century. The government shutdown has delayed the release of official jobs data for September, but on Tuesday, private equity giant Carlyle said its internal indicators suggested the U.S. economy added just 17,000 new payrolls last month. Last week, payrolls processor ADP released a report that also showed a significant jobs-market slowdown.",
      "But the AI boom has helped stock investors grow even wealthier. According to data cited by Barron\u2019s investment magazine, the seven tech stocks that comprise the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d  were responsible for approximately two-thirds of the S&P 500\u2018s 3.65% gain last month, and have powered about 41% of the index\u2019s nearly 15% gain this year.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s always a little bit of K-shaped nature to the economy,\u201d Sosnick said. \u201cBut it went from looking like a small \u2018K\u2019 to a capital \u2018K.\u2019\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, economic uncertainty shows no signs of letting up.",
      "Government shutdowns typically have a limited impact on markets and the economy. This time could be different, though. As the shutdown enters its second week, the White House has begun threatening mass layoffs, while President Donald Trump and other GOP officials are questioning the government\u2019s obligation to issue back pay. With government spending continuing to represent a significant share of the economy, either of these developments could have consequences for growth should they be enacted.",
      "Trump also continues to roll out tariff plans, only to delay their implementation. The latest example is a proposed tariff on imported trucks that was slated to go into effect Oct. 1, before it was delayed a month.",
      "The recent weak jobs data have been enough for the Federal Reserve to conclude that it must lower interest rates to support hiring. Investors now put the odds that the central bank will announce at least two more rate cuts at its final two meetings this year at more than 80%. Yet some Fed members also remain concerned about the pace of inflation, which remains well above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Carlyle also found the inflation rate hitting as much as 3.3% in the services sector last month.",
      "The worsening jobs data is likely to exacerbate the economy\u2019s bifurcated nature if lower rates continue to result in stronger stock gains, Sosnick said. A lackluster \u201creal\u201d economy and a booming stock market \u201ccan coexist for quite some time,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, the New York Federal Reserve said consumer expectations had deteriorated, with worsening outlooks for both the labor market and inflation.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s stock decline could be a warning, however. The market appeared to be derailed by a report from online news outlet The Information that questioned whether one of the key players in the recent AI runup, Oracle, has the ability to successfully finance its commitment to purchase chips from another AI heavyweight, Nvidia.",
      "Some tech analysts had already grown concerned about the circular nature of the AI investment cycle that\u2019s begun to give the impression that the same funds are simply being passed back and forth among the same handful of companies. A representative for Oracle did not respond to a request for comment about the story.",
      "Although the story was solely focused on Oracle, Sosnick said it had pulled the rest of the market down Tuesday because it suggested other companies whose stocks have benefited from AI may also be facing similar difficulties.",
      "With the beneficiaries of the current economic environment already proving increasingly narrow, it wouldn\u2019t take much for a turn in their fortunes to set off a broader downturn, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the economy is right on the precipice, and it wouldn\u2019t take much to push it over edge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels very tenuous and vulnerable, and any little thing that doesn\u2019t stick to script could cause it to go into a recession.\u201d"

      "Much of sleep medicine research focuses on specific problems, such as sleep apnea\u2019s link to cognitive decline, how insomnia affects the heart or whether someone is a night owl or an early bird. The new study, led by researchers at Concordia University in Montreal, looked at the bigger picture.",
      "\u201cPeople should treat their sleep seriously,\u201d said study co-author Valeria Kebets, manager of machine learning projects at Concordia\u2019s Applied AI Institute. \u201cIt affects everything in their daily functioning.\u201d",
      "To define the profiles, researchers analyzed the sleep data of 770 \u201chealthy\u201d young adults ages 22 to 36, indicating they had not been diagnosed with a psychiatric condition, such as bipolar disorder, Kebets said. The data came from the Human Connectome Project, an existing database that studies brain connectivity.",
      "Using a questionnaire called the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, participants self-reported their sleep characteristics for the previous month.",
      "They also underwent functional MRI, a type of scan that maps brain activity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to look at all these different aspects of sleep, all the different dimensions of sleep, because they\u2019re related to different outcomes and they can also be improved by different interventions,\u201d Kebets said.",
      "Next, Kebets and her team analyzed 118 biopsychosocial measures, such as cognition, substance use, demographics and personality.",
      "Someone may fall into more than one of the five categories Kebets and her team identified, especially over time, she said.",
      "For example, if you\u2019re going through a stressful few months at work, the associated sleep disruptions may temporarily align you with a different profile.",
      "\u201cThese are profiles that we all show to a certain degree,\u201d Kebets said.",
      "The researchers identified two general and three specific sleep profiles.",
      "No. 1: Poor sleep and mental health",
      "Characteristics include decreased sleep satisfaction, longer time to fall asleep and greater complaints of sleep disturbances.",
      "People with this pattern of poor sleep experienced daytime impairment and negative emotions, including fear, stress and anger. In addition, people in this group showed worse mental health, such as depression, anxiety and internalizing behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown the association between sleep and mental health.",
      "\u201cBad sleep begets poor mental health,\u201d said J. Todd Arnedt, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program and co-director of the Sleep and Circadian Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan Medical School, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cPoor mental health begets bad sleep.\u201d",
      "No. 2: Sleep resilience and mental health",
      "People in the second profile also reported negative emotions, including sadness, and poor mental health, namely attention difficulties such as inattention and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Low conscientiousness was another attribute.",
      "People in this group who experienced daytime impairments didn\u2019t complain of any sleep difficulties, however. Researchers called the phenomenon \u201csleep resilience.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s possible that people who fit this profile had sleep issues they were unaware of, Kebets said, calling it \u201csleep misperception.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes when you have some mental health issues \u2014 symptoms of anxiety or depression, for instance \u2014 maybe you\u2019re not sleeping as well as usual, but you\u2019re not necessarily acknowledging it because you have other stuff on your mind,\u201d Kebets said.",
      "No. 3: Sleep aids and sociability",
      "The third profile represents people who took hypnotics, or sleep aids, to get a good night\u2019s rest.",
      "People in this group reported social satisfaction, including friendship and emotional support. They also experienced less perceived rejection and fewer attention problems.",
      "However, this profile was also characterized by worse emotional recognition, the ability to identify others\u2019 emotions, and visual episodic memory, the ability to vividly recall past experiences.",
      "No. 4: Sleep duration and cognition",
      "People who reported sleeping fewer than six to seven hours a night had lower agreeableness and higher aggressive behavior.",
      "What\u2019s more, people who slept little showed cognitive consequences. For example, they performed tasks involving emotional processing and fluid intelligence, which is a measure of problem-solving, with worse accuracy.",
      "No. 5: Sleep disturbances, cognition and mental health",
      "Sleep disturbances including pain, breathing issues, frequent urination, temperature imbalance and multiple awakenings are indicators of the fifth profile.",
      "People in this group experienced substance abuse and poor mental health, such as thought problems and anxiety. They also demonstrated aggressive behavior and worse cognitive performance, including language processing.",
      "Sleep critical to mind-body health",
      "There were several major limitations to the research. Participants were overwhelmingly white, healthy, young adults who were working full time. In addition, researchers noted that \u201ca large number of\u201d participants were siblings, even twins.",
      "The study also analyzed people\u2019s sleep behavior for only a month. The five sleep profiles represent a snapshot in time, Arnedt said. \u201cIf you looked at these same people a year later, they may fall in totally different categories.\u201d",
      "He also noted that the study was retrospective, meaning it looked at how participants had slept in the past. Having people keep sleep diaries in real time is a preferred method of studying sleep.",
      "However, by identifying individual sleep profiles, the findings could help sleep clinicians develop personalized treatment approaches, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and medical director of the Northwestern Medicine Sleep Disorders Center.",
      "\u201cWe really need to consider multiple sleep profiles in our research and clinic \u2014 the value of a multidimensional approach to data,\u201d Zee, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research, said in an email.",
      "Dr. Rafael Pelayo, a clinical professor in the division of sleep medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine, also praised the study\u2019s holistic approach. The five profiles, he said, may help predict who\u2019s at risk of developing sleep problems.",
      "It\u2019s critical that everyone, not just health care providers, understands the multidimensional nature of sleep, said Pelayo, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "\u201cSleep is a more complex issue than just how much time you spend in bed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can improve your sleep, it has downwind effects on your overall health \u2014 not just your mental health, but your physical health.\u201d",
      "The new research adds to strong evidence that sleep is essential for brain and body health. Sleep disturbances, Zee said, increase the risk of problems, including mood disorders, immune issues and neurodegeneration, as in Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases.",
      "The bottom line, Pelayo said, is that the research reinforces that hope and help are available for people with sleep difficulties: \u201cNobody should be condemned to sleep poorly the rest of their lives.\u201d"

      "While the result caused \u201csome serious panic and serious s--- hitting the fan,\u201d Moore told the outlet that the film crew \u201creally did come around.\u201d",
      "\u201c(My character) was an artist, a ceramicist, and all of that, and it kind of fit,\u201d she added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an intentional thing to shock them, I think I just really needed a change.\u201d",
      "When asked if she would return to the pixie cut, Moore told People, \u201cI don\u2019t ever like to say never because you never know,\u201d adding, \u201cbut I have grown quite attached to my hair.\u201d",
      "Moore's short hair then turned blond, she explained, when filming \u201cThe Butcher\u2019s Wife,\u201d though she ultimately wore a long, light wig for the 1991 movie.",
      "\u201cThis was a very fun time for me to have blonde hair,\u201d Moore told the outlet. \u201cWhat I realized very quickly is that dyeing your hair blonde trashes it...But it was fun while I had it.\u201d",
      "Filming 1997 film \u201cG.I. Jane,\u201d Moore shaved her head to play a Navy SEAL in training. In a September 2024 interview with Variety, Moore said she also trained in a \u201ctwo-week modified SEAL training,\u201d adding, \u201cIt was hardcore.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The new season of \"Monster\" focuses on Ed Gein, a 20th century killer known for his gruesome house of horrors.",
      "Gein, who lived in a small town in Wisconsin his entire life, admitted to killing two women. He also admitted to robbing multiple graves and adorned his house with items created from body parts.",
      "In the Netflix show, Gein \u2014 played by actor Charlie Hunnam \u2014 attempts to dig up his mother, Augusta Gein's, grave. Augusta (Laurie Metcalf) is said to have had a strong influence on her son.",
      "\"Fanatically religious,\" according to the Gein biography by the true crime write Harold Schecter, Augusta Gein raised her two sons in near isolation, preaching the immorality of modern women. While Ed Gein's brother Henry attempted to pull away, Ed Gein remained devoted to his mother until her death in 1945.",
      "Did Ed Gein Dig Up His Mother's Grave?",
      "Earl Kileen, the district attorney of Washaura County, said in a press conference in 1957 that Ed Gein had denied robbing his mother\u2019s grave, according to the biography \u201cDeviant\u201d by Harold Schecter.",
      "But according to Scott Bowser, an Ed Gein expert who gives tours in the killer's hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, the killer tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to find his mother.",
      "\u201cHe tried, on numerous occasions, to go dig her up, but she was on a cement vault and he couldn\u2019t get to her,\u201d Boswer tells TODAY.com. (Bowser adds, however, the series isn't entirely accurate, focusing \"heavily on gore and shock value rather than truth or history.\")",
      "According to \"Deviant,\" Kileen said the same in the press conference: \"His mother's coffin was encased in a concrete vault.\"",
      "Kileen also confirmed Ed Gein robbed the grave of a woman buried in a wooden box next to his parents' burial plot.",
      "Schecter, speaking to Rolling Stone, shares the theory that Ed Gein was attempting to retrieve his mother. \u201cThe earliest bodies (he) exhumed formed a semi-circle around his mother\u2019s grave,\u201d Schechter said.",
      "As for whether Augusta Gein's influence had to do with what her son became? A 1957 summary from the chief of medical services at Wisconsin's Central State Hospital concluded that Ed Gein was \"overly attached to his mother.\"",
      "The report said that \u201cit seems probable that this activity was the result of his desire to re-create the existence of his own mother.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the death of his mother, he felt that he had a special power whereby he could raise the dead to life by an act of his will power; and when he found that this was not successful, his emotional needs influenced him to attempt the re-creation of his mother by using the parts of bodies from other graves,\u201d the report said.",
      "Ed Gein also lambasted the moral standards of the two women he killed. His comments had a \"strong religious connotation,\" per a social service report from in 1957, and he had learned \"religious training from his mother.\""

She announced in May that she had bought all of her master recordings.",
      "Like Swift, Michael also battled his record company, Sony Music, unsuccessfully suing the company in 1992 over his contract and claiming the company regarded him as \u201cno more than a piece of software,\u201d according to the BBC.",
      "During an appearance on BBC1, Swift also spoke about the connection (or lack thereof) between her song \u201cFather Figure\u201d and the 2024 movie \u201cBabygirl\u201d starring Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson, which features \u201cFather Figure\u201d prominently.",

      "\u201cI appreciate you giving me all the hell that you did and saying, \u2018That\u2019s not right.\u2019 Yes, it was cut up and edited, but I need to take accountability too,\u201d he said.",

      "The latest season of \u201cMonster\u201d tells the story of Ed Gein, a Wisconsin man who killed at least one person and dug up bodies from a cemetery. But there are some killers so vile, the creators of the show say they won\u2019t make a season about them.",
      "Ian Brennan, one of the creators of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMonster\u201d series, told TODAY.com during the \u201cMonster: The Ed Gein Story\u201d red carpet premiere that murderers like Ted Bundy will never get the \u201cMonster\u201d treatment.",
      "\u201cTed Bundy is just a monster. It\u2019s just about sadism and sexual violence. We just don\u2019t find that interesting,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only is that hard to watch, that\u2019s like hard to write. Like, I just don\u2019t, there\u2019s not a mind there that you want to get inside, or even to get inside.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a deep banality to most evil, really, and that\u2019s why someone like Ed (Gein) is so interesting,\u201d he added. \u201cI hesitate to even call him evil, that\u2019s like the wrong vocabulary to even describe him. He was just so deeply strange.\u201d",
      "Brennan said he and Ryan Murphy, the co-creator of \u201cMonster,\u201d try to find stories that are multi-dimensional for the series.",
      "\u201cRather than recoil, you just sort of want to lean in,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cAnd whenever we get to a place where we\u2019re leaning in on something, even as as macabre and dark and strange and upsetting as the Ed Gein story, you know you\u2019re on to something.\u201d",
      "Brennan described Gein as \"a very, very fascinating person\" who \"contains multitudes.\"",
      "\"A big part of this series is starting seasons and abandoning them, because you never know quite know what's gonna feel right. Sometimes we start writing and it's like, 'Eugh,' particularly when you're dealing with murder,\" he said. \"Most murders, most murderers are not interesting. They're just tragic and awful and violent and sadistic. So it takes like, an interesting curveball that can sort of get past all those criticisms internally and be something you want to spend eight hours with.\"",
      "Brennan previously said in an interview with Variety published on Sept. 30 that serial killers like the Golden State Killer and John Wayne Gacy have \"nothing redemptive\" in their stories.",
      "\u201cThe second the name comes up for us, every year, both of us go, No. There\u2019s no pathos,\u201d Brennan said of Gacy.",
      "As for Bundy, Murphy told Variety: \u201cWhen you look at those crimes, what are the themes there? It doesn\u2019t ask you any questions about society. It feels too murderous \u2014 not interesting enough.\u201d",
      "While there may never be a full season about Bundy, the serial killer does make an appearance in \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.\" Here's what to know about the fictional connection between Ed Gein and Ted Bundy.",
      "Did Ed Gein Help Find Ted Bundy?",
      "In the last episode of \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" Gein, played by Charlie Hunnam, appears to help authorities find Bundy, though it also could be a figment of his own imagination as he thinks through the killers he could have influenced after he inspired movies like \"Psycho.\"",
      "In real life, Gein had no connection to Bundy's arrest.",
      "Gein was arrested in 1957 after investigators found the body of Bernice Worden, a local hardware store owner, hanging by the heels on his property, according to the Associated Press.",
      "When investigators went inside Gein's home, they found a house of horrors, including severed body parts, furniture made of human skin and more, according to the AP.",
      "After his arrest, Gein admitted to killing two people and digging up the graves of several women in interviews with investigators, according to a transcript of the interviews included in the book, \u201cThe Ed Gein File\u201d compiled by John Borowski.",
      "Gein was sent to a psychiatric hospital after his arrest, and in 1968, a judge found him guilty of murder, though the same judge later ruled Gein was insane at the time of the crime and sent him back to the facility, according to the Associated Press.",
      "In 1978, Gein was transferred to the Mendota Mental Health Institute, where he would remain until his death in 1984, meaning he was in the hospital when Bundy committed his crimes and was unable to help authorities with Bundy's arrest.",
      "Bundy was convicted of killing three people, though he confessed to killing more than two dozen women and girls, and he's suspected in the murderers of even more, according to the FBI.",
      "A Pensacola, Florida, police officer initiated a traffic stop on Feb. 15, 1978, after he noticed an orange Volkswagen Beetle was stolen, according to the FBI. Bundy, inside the car, resisted arrest but was eventually taken into custody.",
      "The officer didn't know who Bundy was, but he was later identified, as he had been added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Feb. 10, 1978, according to the FBI.",
      "After Bundy was convicted, he was sentenced to death and was executed by electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989."

      "Neeley was a Division 1 tennis star at Brigham Young University. She says she managed to party as much as she played, partly to escape memories of her abuser. Finding a new boyfriend seemed to help her maintain stability ... until she learned that she was pregnant and that he had been unfaithful.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to become a mom that young. I was not ready. I\u2019ll just put it that way,\" she says.",
      "Once she gave birth to her son Hudson, however, her outlook shifted dramatically.",
      "\"Something just switched inside of me,\" she explains. \"Those feelings you feel when you have a baby are so magical that I just couldn't imagine life without him. He is what I was put on earth to do, even though I'm so young. I was like, 'This is my purpose.' He made my life make sense again.\"",
      "With the support of her family, Neeley says, she returned to college and her tennis team, and she began clinging more to her Mormon beliefs. She met and married Jacob Neeley in 2018. The couple is raising 10-year-old Hudson, as well as 4-year-old Harlow and baby Charli, born last July.",
      "Introducing Hudson to His \"Bio Dad\"",
      "On the advice of a therapist, Mayci and Jacob began telling Hudson about his biological father when he was around 4 years old.",
      "\"The day we told him, he was very casual because he was so young,\" she recalls. \"And then as he got older, it was such a normal part of his life that it was never a secret.\"",
      "Hudson's biological grandparents still spend time with their grandson. \"I invite them to Hudson's baseball games and stuff like that so he can hear about his bio dad from them,\" Neeley says.",
      "\"We've tried our best to keep it natural and casual, to where it's not a secret, but we're not putting pictures of his bio dad around the walls,\" she says.",
      "Reliving Past Trauma",
      "Because Neeley told her story to friends and relatives so many times in the last 10 years, she says she feels almost \"desensitized\" to her traumatic past. But writing everything down in book form was another story.",
      "\"I was doing a lot of it pregnant too,\" she says. \"Your emotions are a little more heightened. It wasn't easy process by any means.\"",
      "She remains extremely close to her parents: Her mother helped care for Hudson while Neeley finished college and her father inspired her to write this book.",
      "\"He was so mad learning more about the abuse I went through,\" Neeley said of her father reading her book. \"He's like, 'Why wouldn't you have told me?' I was like, 'Because I didn't want you to go to jail!'\"",
      "Though Neeley says she was often \"annoyed\" with her mother's endless positivity,  her mom was also her \"best friend\" throughout the process.",
      "\"Everything that we went through \u2014 me getting pregnant \u2014 especially for a Mormon was not ideal,\" Mayci says. \"My parents really were my rock during that time.\"",
      "\"They pushed me to know that just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you have to give up on your dreams,\" she says.",
      "Being Labeled a \"Pot Stirrer\"",
      "On Hulu's \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\" Neeley often gets criticized for being \"a pot stirrer\" or \"riding the fence.\" But the comments don't concern her.",
      "\"I have a very thick skin,\" she says.",
      "\"I've been through so much that the drama, the he-said/she-said, doesn\u2019t matter. At the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot worse things going on, so I just don\u2019t like to insert myself in things that aren\u2019t specifically about me.\"",
      "In fact, Neeley is so diplomatic that she has been splitting her \"Dancing With the Stars\" votes 50/50 between her two \"Secret Lives\" castmates, Whitney Leavitt and Jennifer Affleck.",
      "\"I love both of them. I want them to both succeed,\" she says.",
      "And will she watch castmate Taylor Frankie Paul look for love as \"The Bachelorette\"?",
      "\"100%!\" she says excitedly. \"I will be throwing watch parties. I will be ready.\"",
      "Mayci is also excited for viewers to watch Season 3 of \"Secret Lives: \"Buckle up! It's just juicy. It's wild!\""

Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",

Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

      "But two that have eluded him potentially mean the most to his legacy and his dogged pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The first is the Russia-Ukraine war, which is no closer to ending now than when Trump took office in January. The other is Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump posted a video on Truth Social on Friday night in response to Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying: \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council staff in Trump\u2019s first term.",

      "\u201cLike the rest of the world, I\u2019m hoping this news means imminent return of the hostages and action addressing the Gaza humanitarian crisis, along with a ceasefire and path to peace and normalizing relations in the region,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News.",
      "Some were more skeptical, questioning whether Hamas can be trusted to follow through on its commitments.",
      "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cI\u2019d be a bit more cautious given that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a track record of saying one thing and doing another.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",

The detainees, whose vessels were boarded by Israeli military personnel, were deported to Greece and Slovakia, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",
      "The first phase of the talks will deal with the release of the remaining 48 hostages, some 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "The plan also calls for the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas agreed to some of this proposal Friday, while sidestepping Trump\u2019s call for it to disband and disarm.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi denied as baseless reports in Arab media that the group had agreed to lay down its weapons.",

      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Leo urged the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics on Sunday to care for immigrants, pressing ahead with a message of welcome for migrants days after criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s hard-line anti-immigration policies.",
      "Leo, the first U.S. pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square that immigrants should not be treated with \u201cthe coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination.\u201d",
      "The pope, who did not single out any country for its treatment of migrants, called on Catholics to \u201copen our arms and hearts to them, welcoming them as brothers and sisters, and being for them a presence of consolation and hope.\u201d",
      "'New missionary age'",
      "Leo had criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church\u2019s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.",
      "On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing \u201ca new missionary age\u201d in which it was tasked with offering \u201chospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity\u201d to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.",
      "\u201cIn the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world\u2019s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,\u201d he said.",
      "Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticized the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.",
      "Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church\u2019s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries."

    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d",

      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",
      "Koizumi, 44, the current agriculture minister and the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, would have been Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",

    "summary": "The terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, has stoked fears among Britain's Jewish community amid a rise in antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "Mullally is the first female Archbishop of Canterbury to be chosen since women were allowed to become bishops in 2014.",
      "As the spiritual leader of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury heads a global Anglican community of around 85 million people across 165 countries.",
      "In a statement following her appointment, Mullally said: \u201cAs I respond to the call of Christ to this new ministry, I do so in the same spirit of service to God and to others that has motivated me since I first came to faith as a teenager.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt every stage of that journey, through my nursing career and Christian ministry, I have learned to listen deeply \u2014 to people and to God\u2019s gentle prompting \u2014 to seek to bring people together to find hope and healing.\u201d",
      "Mullally became the first female bishop of London in 2018, having first been ordained in 2001. Before joining the church, she had been a specialist cancer nurse, rising to become the government\u2019s youngest chief nursing officer for England at the age of 37.",

      "\u201cThe Church of England is of profound importance to this country. Its churches, cathedrals, schools, and charities are part of the fabric of our communities,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "In an address following her appointment, Mullally said that \u201cin the apparent chaos which surrounds us, in the midst of such profound global uncertainty, the possibility of healing lies in acts of kindness and love.\u201d",
      "She added that Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester showed that Church of England members \u201chave a responsibility to be a people who stand with the Jewish community against antisemitism in all its forms. Hatred and racism of any kind cannot be allowed to tear us apart.\u201d"
