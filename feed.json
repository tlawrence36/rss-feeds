      "The avant-noise artist Kim Gordon debuted solo music 10 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago, Kim Gordon \u2014 a revolutionary force in the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, the \u201980s New York no wave scene and the space between art and noise \u2014 debuted solo music. At the time, she was already decades into a celebrated, mixed-medium creative career.",
      "The midtempo \u201cMurdered Out\u201d was her first single, where clangorous, overdubbed guitars met the unmistakable rasp of her deadpan intonations. It was a surprise from an experimentalist well-versed in the unexpected: The song took inspiration from Los Angeles car culture, and its main collaborator was the producer Justin Raisen, then best known for his pop work with Sky Ferreira and Charli XCX. Their partnership has continued in the decade since, and on March 13, Gordon will drop her third solo album, \u201cPlay Me,\u201d announced Wednesday alongside the release of a hazy, transcendent single, \u201cNot Today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a happy accident,\u201d she says of her continued work with Raisen. \u201cIn the beginning, I was somewhat skeptical of working with a producer and collaborator, really. But it\u2019s turned out to be incredibly freeing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlay Me\u201d follows Gordon's critically lauded, beat-heavy 2024 album \u201cThe Collective,\u201d a noisy body of work that featured oddball trap blasts. It earned her two Grammy nominations \u2014 a career first \u2014 for alternative music album and alternative music performance. Those were for the song \u201cBye Bye,\u201d with its eerie, dissonant beat originally written for rapper Playboi Carti. For \u201cPlay Me,\u201d Gordon reimagined the track for the closer, \u201cBye Bye 25!\u201d She says it was the result of her thinking about the rap world, where revisiting and remixing is commonplace.",
      "\u201cI came up with the idea of using these words that Trump had sort of \u2018banned\u2019 in his mind,\u201d she says of the new song's lyrics. (An example: \u201cInjustice / Opportunity / Dietary guidelines / Housing for the future.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.) For Gordon, because it became \u201cmore conceptual \u2026 the remake doesn\u2019t seem as anxiety-provoking as the original.\u201d",
      "There is a connective spirit between \u201cThe Collective\u201d and \u201cPlay Me\u201d \u2014 a shared confrontation, propulsive production and songs that possess a keen ability to process and reflect the world around Gordon. \u201cIt does feel kind of like an evolution,\u201d she says of this album next to her last. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a more focused record, and immediate.\u201d The songs are shorter and attentive.",
      "Or, to put it more simply: \u201cI like beats and that inspires me more than melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cBeats and space.\u201d",
      "That palette drives \u201cPlay Me,\u201d a foundation in which staccato lyricism transforms and offers astute criticism. Consider the title track, which challenges passive listening and the devaluation of music in the age of streaming. She names Spotify playlist titles, imagined genres defined by mood rather than music. \u201cRich popular girl / Villain mode\u201d she speak-sings, \u201cJazz and background / Chillin' after work.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just representative of, you know, this era we're in, this culture of convenience,\u201d she says. \u201cMusic always represented a certain amount of freedom to me, and it feels like that\u2019s kind of been blanketed over.\u201d",
      "Sonically, it is a message delivered atop a '70s groove, placing it in conversation with an era unshackled from these digital technologies.",
      "The title, too, \u201cis playing off the sort of passive nature of listening to music,\u201d she says, \u201cBut also it could be seen as defiant. Like, I dare you to play me.\u201d",
      "There's also the blown-out \u201cSubcon,\u201d which examines the world's growing billionaire class and their fascination with space colonialization in a period of economic insecurity. In the song, Gordon's lyrical abstractions highlight the absurdity, taking aim at technocrats.",
      "\u201cI find reality inspirational, no matter how bad it is,\u201d she says. Where some artists might veer away from the news, Gordon tackles truth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what music is supposed to be. So, I\u2019m just doing my version of it.\u201d",
      "In the end, she hopes listeners are \u201csomewhat thrilled by\u201d the album.",

      "Nia DaCosta directs from a returning Alex Garland script and it starts right where 2025's \u201c28 Years Later\u201d \u2014 directed by Danny Boyle \u2014 left off.

      "An emotional plea by Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi and moving words from Ryan Coogler on the violence in Minneapolis have defined this year's National Board of Review Awards",
      "NEW YORK -- An emotional plea by Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi and moving words from Ryan Coogler on the violence in Minneapolis stirred a National Board of Review Awards ceremony Tuesday in which Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d was again crowned the best film of the year.",
      "Coming two days after Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes, the annual, untelevised New York gala, held in the cavernous midtown banquet all Cipriani 42nd Street and hosted by Willie Geist, played out as a more intimate and frank-spoken alternative.",
      "The winners themselves were already announced, so the night was always going to belong to \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d The National Board of review, a group that is made up of film enthusiasts and dates to 1909, not only named it 2025\u2019s best film but awarded the best actor prize to Leonardo DiCaprio, best director to Anderson, best supporting actor to Benicio Del Toro and breakthrough performer to Chase Infiniti.",
      "Yet in an ongoing parade of awards for \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d its night at the NBRs still stood out. The surprise presenter of the movie\u2019s best film award was Martin Scorsese, who praised \u201cthe audacity\u201d of Anderson\u2019s narratives and the accomplishment of his latest.",
      "\u201cLike all great films, it can\u2019t really be compared to anything else,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201cIt stands alone. It\u2019s a great American film.\u201d",
      "Anderson, trying to take in the wealth of honors, attempted to describe what \u201c One Battle After Another,\u201d his father-daughter tale of revolution, might represent. His answer came in pointing out his own daughter, sitting at his table.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what our movie is about, but I do know it\u2019s about loving your kids,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "For many of the honorees, the world outside the starry banquet weighed heavily. Coogler\u2019s speech was among the night\u2019s most poignant. The \u201cSinners\u201d director was honored for his screenplay for the vampire thriller and was introduced by the film\u2019s star, longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan.",
      "Both were honored 13 years earlier by the board for their first movie together, \u201c Fruitvale Station.\u201d Recalling that film, based on the true story of the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer in Oakland, California, Coogler turned to the recent fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration enforcement agent in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cI was young and naive, and I thought the movie was going to change the world and make it so you didn\u2019t see people executed by civil service on camera anymore,\u201d Coogler said. \u201cI was proven wrong again and again. And it\u2019s tough to be here and not think about Minnesota.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t be here and not think about Renee,\u201d Coogler added.",

      "Still, the ceremony\u2019s most powerful words came from Panahi, the dissident Iranian filmmaker who for nearly two decades worked clandestinely in his native country while being placed under house arrest and jailed. Panahi\u2019s latest, \u201c It Was Just an Accident,\u201d was awarded best international film.",
      "The movie, inspired by Panahi's own imprisonment, is a revenge drama about stopping the cycle of violence and oppression in Iran. On Tuesday the death toll from a nationwide crackdown on demonstrators in that country surpassed 2,500, according to activists.",
      "\u201cAs we stand here, the state of Iran is gunning down protesters and a savage massacre continues blatantly on the streets of Iran,\u201d Panahi said. \u201cToday the real scene is not on screens but on the streets of Iran. The Islamic Republic has caused a bloodbath to delay its collapse.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is no longer a metaphor,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is not a story. This is not a film. This is a reality written with bullets day after day.\u201d",
      "Panahi called on the film community to speak out and \u201cuse any voice and any platform you have.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, cinema has the power to stand by defenseless people,\u201d Panahi said. \u201cLet\u2019s stand by them.\u201d",
      "Panahi\u2019s remarks, delivered through an interpreter, shook the audience. And when the next award went to Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar, for adapted screenplay for their plaintive Pacific Northwest period drama \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d the filmmakers seemed to cut short their speech, which was partially about how making the movie and then promoting it through awards season meant sacrificing time with their young children.",
      "\u201cWhen the world is kind of burning down, it can feel frivolous at times,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cI just want to say thank you most of all to Mr. Panahi for reminding us for what we can do with the medium and why it can be worth doing.\u201d",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Organizers of Australia\u2019s largest free literary festival canceled the event Tuesday after more than 180 writers and speakers withdrew over the scrapping of an appearance by an Australian-Palestinian writer and academic.",
      "The uproar began when the board of the Adelaide Festival, which runs Adelaide Writers Week, announced on Jan. 8 that they had disinvited Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from the event \u201cgiven her previous statements\u201d and citing cultural sensitivities \u201cat this unprecedented time so soon after\u201d an antisemitic mass shooting at Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach.",
      "There was no suggestion that Abdel-Fattah or her writings \u201chave any connection with the tragedy,\u201d the board members added.",
      "They didn\u2019t cite any specific statements by the lawyer, academic and writer of fiction and nonfiction that prompted their decision. Abdel-Fattah decried the move as \u201ccensorship\u201d and said the announcement suggested that her \u201cmere presence\u201d was culturally insensitive.",
      "By Tuesday, when the event was canceled, most of the programmed speakers had withdrawn. The episode unfolded amid a fraught national debate in Australia about limits on speech following the Bondi shooting.",
      "A father and son who were apparently inspired by Islamic State group ideology are accused of the massacre during a Hanukkah event in December, in which 15 people were shot dead. The surviving suspect, Naveed Akram, has not entered a plea to the dozens of murder, terrorism and other charges he faces.",
      "In the aftermath, the Jewish Community Council for South Australia \u2014 the state where Adelaide is located \u2014 wrote to the festival to lobby for Abdel-Fattah\u2019s exclusion, the group's spokesperson Norman Schueler told The Adelaide Advertiser. The Premier of South Australia state Peter Malinauskus also supported the writer\u2019s removal.",
      "The Adelaide Writers Week was scheduled to run for six days beginning in late February, as part of a wider annual culture festival. The 2025 literary event was the festival\u2019s 40th and attracted 160,000 attendees.",
      "Born in Australia to Palestinian and Egyptian parents, Abdel-Fattah often writes about Islamophobia and had been invited to speak about her novel Discipline, which follows two Muslims, a journalist and a university student, navigating issues of censorship in Sydney. She has been a critic of the Israeli government and an advocate for Palestinians throughout the two-year war in Gaza.",
      "After the board\u2019s statement canceling Abdel-Fattah\u2019s appearance, other speakers on the program \u2014 including British novelist Zadie Smith and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \u2014 withdrew from their events too. The Festival\u2019s director quit Tuesday, citing her objections to the board\u2019s decision to disinvite Abdel-Fattah.",
      "Louise Adler, a Jewish Australian, wrote in the Guardian that she could not \u201cbe party to silencing writers.\u201d She said 70% of the event's speakers had withdrawn.",

      "Board members wanted to \u201creiterate this is not about identity or dissent but rather a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression in our nation following Australia\u2019s worst terror attack in history,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Abdel-Fattah rejected the apology in a post on X Tuesday, lambasting the decision to cancel her appearance as \u201ca blatant act of anti-Palestinian racism.\u201d She said the board had apologized for how her removal was presented but not for the decision itself.",
      "The removal of Abdel-Fattah prompted some sponsors of the event to withdraw, too. The fate of the wider Adelaide Festival was unclear Tuesday, although a new board was due to be appointed Wednesday.",
      "The event is a major draw for the state and generated millions of dollars in revenue and hundreds of jobs in 2025, a report by the festival organization said.",
      "Abdel-Fattah\u2019s exclusion came amid proposed or enacted law changes covering hate speech, protest and guns after the Bondi massacre.

      "Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of his victims over two decades.

      "The case sent shock waves across Indian Country when he was arrested and indicted in early 2023. There were many setbacks and delays, but the case finally proceeded to trial after prosecutors added allegations that he filmed himself having sex with a child.",

Chasing Horse previously had treated the victim\u2019s breathing issues and her mother\u2019s spider bite, according to a court transcript. He allegedly told her the spirits wanted her to give up her virginity in exchange for her mother\u2019s health.

Judge Jessica Peterson removed Chasing Horse from the courtroom when he tried to interrupt her, and she denied his request.",

That put it just on the edge of becoming Disney\u2019s highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only the $1.66 billion brought in by 2019's photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d",
      "In its seventh week, it was fourth at the North American box office with $10.1 million for a domestic total of $378.8 million.",

      "The figures came on a Sunday when much of Hollywood's attention is on the Golden Globe Awards. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2\u201d are nominated for two awards apiece.",

      "Two new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show wastewater monitoring of measles can flag measles spread days to weeks in advance",
      "Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to measles infections days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.",
      "The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including COVID-19, polio, mpox and bird flu.",
      "But the national wastewater surveillance system, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about $125 million a year to about $25 million.",
      "Peggy Honein, director of the CDC's division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would \u201csustain some of the most critical activities\u201d but \u201cit would likely require some prioritization.\u201d",
      "The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six \u201ccenters for excellence\u201d \u2014 Colorado among them \u2014 that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing.",
      "The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started pushing back against cuts to health care in general.",
      "But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.",
      "Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado\u2019s wastewater surveillance unit.",
      "The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.",
      "\u201cI know that there are other states that haven\u2019t been as fortunate as us,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.\u201d",
      "In the Colorado study, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado.",
      "In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases.",

      "In Oregon, researchers used preserved sewage samples from late 2024 to determine if sewage testing could have discovered a burgeoning outbreak.",
      "The 30-case outbreak spanned two counties and hit a close-knit community that does not readily seek health care, the study's authors wrote. The first case was confirmed on July 11 and it ultimately took health officials 15 weeks to stop the outbreak.",
      "The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe knew that we were missing cases, and I think that's always the case in measles outbreaks,\u201d said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. \u201cBut this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.\u201d",
      "Other states, such as Utah, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.",
      "And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state's system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department.",
      "The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.",
      "Sutton, of Oregon, said she's hopeful federal leaders will see the power of the system, its adaptability, affordability and reach.",

      "The nonprofit Kidney Transplant Collaborative analyzed federal data and found 116 fewer kidney transplants were performed last year than in 2024.

      "Federal data released Wednesday showed that overdose deaths have been falling for more than two years \u2014 the longest drop in decades \u2014 but also that the decline was slowing.",
      "And the monthly death toll is still not back to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, let alone where it was before the current overdose epidemic struck decades ago, said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "\u201cOverall I think this continues to be encouraging, especially since we're seeing declines almost across the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Overdose deaths began steadily climbing in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths from heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Deaths peaked nearly 110,000 in 2022, fell a little in 2023 and then plummeted 27% in 2024, to around 80,000. That was the largest one-year decline ever recorded.",
      "The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data runs through August 2025 and represents the first update of monthly provisional drug overdose deaths since the federal government shutdown.",
      "An estimated 73,000 people died from overdoses in the 12-month period that ended August 2025, down about 21% from the 92,000 in the previous 12-month period.",
      "CDC officials reported that deaths were down in all states except Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico and North Dakota. But they noted it's likely that not all overdose deaths have been reported yet in every state, and additional data in the future might affect that state count.",
      "Researchers cannot yet say with confidence why deaths have gone down. Experts have offered multiple possible explanations: increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in how people use drugs, and the growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.",
      "Some also point to research that suggests the number of people likely to overdose has been shrinking, as fewer teens take up drugs and many illicit drug users have died.",
      "Two other theories recently joined the list.",
      "In a paper published last week in the journal Science, University of Maryland researchers point to the drug supply. They say regulatory changes in China a few years ago appear to have diminished the availability of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl.",

It suggests it became harder to make fentanyl and its potency was diluted.",

      "The recent deceleration of overdose deaths could be because producers in Canada and Mexico found alternative sources, Reuter and his colleagues think.",
      "Their paper drew inspiration from a team of University of Pittsburgh researchers, who earlier concluded that regulatory changes in China concerning the drug carfentanil were an important explanation for a dip in U.S. overdose deaths in 2018.",
      "Those same Pittsburgh researchers \u2014 Dr. Donald Burke and Dr. Hawre Jalal \u2014 are now focused on another theory for what's happened to overdose deaths. In a paper published last week in the International Journal of Drug Policy, they say overdose trends may be at least partly tied to federal stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "Louisiana is pushing to extradite a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills, challenging laws that protect telehealth providers shipping these pills nationwide",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana pushed Tuesday to extradite a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills, setting up a likely test of laws designed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "This is the second time Louisiana has pursued an out-of-state doctor under its abortion restrictions, with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry saying on social media that he wants to bring the abortion provider \u201cto justice.\u201d The two criminal cases pit Louisiana, which has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, against jurisdictions that have enacted what are known as shield laws for providers who facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has a zero tolerance policy for those who subvert our laws, seek to hurt women, and promote abortion,\u201d Landry said in a post X announcing he'd sent the extradition paperwork. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment",
      "Remy Coeytaux, a physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, faces a criminal charge of abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday. If convicted, the doctor could face up to 50 years in jail and fines, Murrill said.",
      "An email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "According to court documents, he is accused of mailing mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 to a Louisiana woman who sought the medication through Aid Access, a European online telemedicine service. The woman took the pills in combination to end her pregnancy, investigators wrote in the indictment, which says authorities confirmed Coeytaux as the sender.",
      "Murrill told The Associated Press she believes this \u201cis not the only time he sent abortion pills into our state\u201d and that \u201cit probably won't be the last time we will indict him.\u201d",
      "The Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group that is representing Coeytaux against civil charges, stressed that the criminal charge in Louisiana is an allegation.",

      "Coeytaux is also the subject of a separate federal lawsuit filed in July in Texas, where a man alleges the doctor illegally provided abortion medication to his girlfriend.",
      "Medication abortion has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2000. Louisiana bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest. Physicians convicted of providing abortions face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines. Last year, state lawmakers passed additional restrictions targeting out-of-state prescribers and reclassified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances.",
      "The law came after an arrest warrant was issued in Louisiana in a separate case for a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a pregnant minor. In that case, officials said the minor\u2019s mother ordered the medication online and directed her daughter to take it. The mother was later arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",
      "That case appeared to be the first of its kind since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "Louisiana also sought that doctor\u2019s extradition, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul refused, saying her state\u2019s shield laws were designed to protect providers who offer abortion care to patients in states with bans or where telehealth prescribing is restricted. New York and California are among eight states with such protections, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",

      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",

      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",

      "China and Canada have pledged to improve relations after years of tension",
      "BEIJING -- Faced with new global challenges, the leaders of China and Canada pledged Friday to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.",
      "Xi Jinping told visiting Prime Minister Mark Carney that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.",
      "\u201cIt can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China\u2013Canada relations toward improvement,\u201d China's top leader said.",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, said better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as \u201cunder great strain.\u201d",
      "He called for a new relationship \u201cadapted to new global realities\u201d and cooperation in agriculture, energy and finance.",
      "Those new realities reflect in large part the so-called America-first approach of U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \u201ca time of global trade disruption.\u201d",

      "Venezuelans in Spain are reacting to the news of Nicolas Maduro's capture by U.S. forces with mixed emotions",
      "MADRID -- Venezuelans living in Spain reacted to the news of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s capture by U.S. forces with a mix of awe, joy and fear, gathering at rallies and watching the events unfold back home at breakneck speed.",
      "Some 600,000 Venezuelans live in Spain, home to the largest population anywhere outside the Americas. Many fled political persecution and violence but also the country\u2019s collapsing economy.",
      "A majority live in the capital, Madrid, working in hospitals, restaurants, cafes, nursing homes and elsewhere. While some Venezuelan migrants have established deep roots and lives in the Iberian nation, others have just arrived.",
      "Here is what three of them had to say about the events unfolding back home.",
      "___",
      "David Vallenilla woke up to text messages from a cousin on Jan. 3 informing him \u201cthat they invaded Venezuela.\u201d The 65-year-old from Caracas lives alone in a tidy apartment in the south of Madrid with two Daschunds and a handful of birds. He was in disbelief.",
      "\u201cIn that moment, I wanted certainty,\u201d Vallenilla said, \u201ccertainty about what they were telling me.\u201d",
      "In June 2017, Vallenilla\u2019s son, a 22-year-old nursing student in Caracas named David Jos\u00e9, was shot point-blank by a Venezuelan soldier after taking part in a protest near a military air base in the capital. He later died from his injuries. Video footage of the incident was widely publicized, turning his son\u2019s death into an emblematic case of the Maduro government\u2019s repression against protesters that year.",
      "After demanding answers for his son\u2019s death, Vallenilla, too, started receiving threats and decided two years later to move to Spain with the help of an nongovernmental organization.",
      "On the day of Maduro\u2019s capture, Vallenilla said his phone was flooded with messages about his son.",
      "\u201cMany told me, \u2018Now David will be resting in peace. David must be happy in heaven,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut don't think it was easy: I spent the whole day crying.\u201d",
      "Vallenilla is watching the events in Venezuela unfold with skepticism but also hope. He fears more violence, but says he has hope the Trump administration can effect the change that Venezuelans like his son tried to obtain through elections, popular protests and international institutions.",
      "\u201cNothing will bring back my son. But the fact that some justice has begun to be served for those responsible helps me see a light at the end of the tunnel. Besides, I also hope for a free Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Journalist Carleth Morales first came to Madrid a quarter-century ago when Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was reelected as Venezuela's president in 2000 under a new constitution.",
      "The 54-year-old wanted to study and return home, taking a break of sorts in Madrid as she sensed a political and economic environment that was growing more and more challenging.",
      "\u201cI left with the intention of getting more qualified, of studying, and of returning because I understood that the country was going through a process of adaptation between what we had known before and, well, Ch\u00e1vez and his new policies,\" Morales said. \"But I had no idea that we were going to reach the point we did.\u201d",

      "\u201cOf course, we hope to recover a democratic country, a free country, a country where human rights are respected,\u201d Morales said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to think that as a Venezuelan when we\u2019ve lived through so many things and suffered so much.\u201d",
      "Morales sees it as unlikely that she would return home, having spent more than two decades in Spain, but she said she hopes her daughters can one day view Venezuela as a viable option.",
      "\u201cI once heard a colleague say, \u2018I work for Venezuela so that my children will see it as a life opportunity.\u2019 And I adopted that phrase as my own. So perhaps in a few years it won\u2019t be me who enjoys a democratic Venezuela, but my daughters.\u201d",
      "For two weeks, Ver\u00f3nica Noya has waited for her phone to ring with the news that her husband and brother have been freed.",
      "Noya\u2019s husband, Venezuelan army Capt. Antonio Sequea, was imprisoned in 2020 after having taken part in a military incursion to oust Maduro. She said he remains in solitary confinement in the El Rodeo prison in Caracas. For 20 months, Noya has been unable to communicate with him or her brother, who was also arrested for taking part in the same plot.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when my nightmare began,\u201d Noya said.",
      "Venezuelan authorities have said hundreds of political prisoners have been released since Maduro's capture, while rights groups have said the real number is a fraction of that. Noya has waited in agony to hear anything about her four relatives, including her husband's mother, who remain imprisoned.",
      "Meanwhile, she has struggled with what to tell her children when they ask about their father's whereabouts. They left Venezuela scrambling and decided to come to Spain because family roots in the country meant that Noya already had a Spanish passport.",
      "Still, she hopes to return to her country.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Venezuelan above all else,\u201d Noya said. \u201cAnd I dream of seeing a newly democratic country.\"",

      "Human Rights Watch criticizes the Syrian government for lacking accountability in sectarian violence",
      "BEIRUT -- Human Rights Watch on Thursday criticized the Syrian government for what it says is the lack of accountability on perpetrators of sectarian violence and killings on all sides in clashes between government-backed armed Bedouin clans and Druze militias in a southern province in July that killed hundreds of civilians.",
      "In its report, the rights group said it documented 86 \u201capparently unlawful killings\u201d of civilians in Sweida province, of which 67 were Druze and 19 were Bedouin.",
      "Human Rights Watch said it interviewed eyewitnesses and survivors, who said that government forces destroyed civilian property and committed summary killings.",
      "They said the armed Bedouin groups backed by the government looted homes and kidnapped people, while Druze militias attacked and detained Bedouin civilians in a series of revenge raids.",
      "The clashes in the southern province of Sweida marked another setback for President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who has been struggling to assert his government's full authority across the war-torn country and appeal to Syria's minorities, which are largely skeptical of his Islamist-led rule.",
      "Under the autocratic leadership of Bashar Assad, the Druze had a degree of autonomy during the conflict as they largely stayed away from the fighting. Since his fall in December 2024, members of the small religious sect have been navigating a new, uncertain Syria.",
      "In mid-July, armed groups affiliated with Druze spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri clashed with local Bedouin clans, spurring intervention by government forces who effectively sided with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters. The United Nations estimates that 187,000 people were displaced by the end of the month.",
      "The majority of the Druze community in Syria live in Sweida province. Since then, a large group of the militias banded together under al-Hijri, creating a de facto anonymous area in large swaths of the province, backed by neighboring Israel.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s acknowledgment of atrocities isn\u2019t enough if those leading and directing abusive forces are shielded from justice,\u201d deputy Middle East Director of Human Rights Watch Adam Coogle said in the report. \u201cWithout senior-level accountability and structural reform of the security sector, Syria will continue to face cycles of violence and reprisals.\u201d",

      "Consumer advocates say ratepayers in the mid-Atlantic electricity grid \u2014 which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already paying billions of dollars in higher bills to underwrite the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",

In parts of the country, data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to the grid.",

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.",
      "Gas and electric utilities sought or won rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period a year earlier.",

      "The Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has brought heightened attention to a key drama that will play out at the central bank in the coming months: Will Powell leave the Fed when his term as chair ends, or will ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has brought heightened attention to a key drama that will play out at the central bank in the coming months: Will Powell leave the Fed when his term as chair ends, or will he take the unusual step of remaining a governor?",
      "Powell's term as Fed chair finishes on May 15, but because of the central bank's complex structure, he has a separate term as one of seven members of its governing board that lasts until January 31, 2028. Historically, nearly all Fed chairs have stepped down from the board when they are no longer chair. But Powell could be the first in nearly 50 years to stay on as a governor.",
      "Many Fed-watchers believe that the criminal investigation into Powell's testimony about cost overruns for Fed building renovations was intended to intimidate him out of taking that step. If Powell stays on the board, it would deny the White House a chance to gain a majority, undercutting the Trump administration's efforts to seize greater control over what has for decades been an institution largely insulated from day-to-day politics.",
      "\u201cI find it very difficult to see Powell leaving before midnight on Jan. 31, 2028,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top economist at the Fed and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"This is a mortal threat to the governance structure of the Fed as we\u2019ve known it for 90 years. And I think that Powell does take that threat exceedingly seriously, and therefore will believe that it is his solemn duty to continue to occupy his seat on the board of governors.\u201d",
      "Powell, 72, was appointed as Fed chair by Trump in 2018, and must step down from the position in May because his second four-year term is ending. He has declined several times to comment on his plans beyond that when asked by reporters. A spokesperson declined to comment for this story.",
      "Trump has sought to push out Powell before his time is up, obsessively attacking him for not cutting rates as sharply as the president wants, particularly in light of ongoing concerns about high costs for groceries, utilities, and housing that have remained a salient political issue even as inflation has cooled.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump highlighted that mortgage rates have declined in the past year. \u201cIf I had the help of the Fed, it would be easier,\u201d he said. \"But that jerk will be gone soon.\u201d",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Here is a look at the impacts of whether or not Powell stays on the board could have:",
      "Trump said Tuesday that he hopes to name a new Fed chair in the next few weeks. But that could get held up by the criminal investigation of Powell.",
      "Several Republican senators, including at least two on the banking committee who would have to approve Trump\u2019s nominees to the Fed, have expressed skepticism that Powell committed crimes during his testimony last June regarding the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump has criticized as excessive. That testimony is the subject of subpoenas sent to the Fed by U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he would not vote for any Fed nominees until the legal cloud around Powell is resolved. That would be enough to delay a nomination from getting out of the banking committee.",
      "If no new chair of the Fed's board has been confirmed by May 15, then Powell could remain in that post until a replacement has been confirmed. As a result, the Fed might not cut interest rates anywhere near as quickly as Trump wants.",

      "If Powell stays on as a governor even after he is no longer chair, Trump could still name someone to lead the Fed but that would give him a total of three appointments on the board \u2014 including two from his first term \u2014 and short of a majority.",
      "So even if Trump nominates a chair who seeks to do the president\u2019s bidding regarding interest rates, that person \u201cwould have very little persuasive power with his colleagues,\" said Wilcox, who is also director of research at Bloomberg Economics. Powell, along with other members of the Fed's 19-member interest-rate setting committee, could outvote the new chair. That hasn't happened since 1986.",
      "In that case, Trump could nominate a fourth person to the board and gain a majority. He could even then add a fifth, if the Supreme Court allows his attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook to proceed. The high court will hear her case on Wednesday.",
      "A majority on the board would enable the White House to make sweeping changes to the Fed. Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has advocated numerous reforms to reduce the central bank's influence in the economy and financial markets.",
      "Trump's majority on the Fed's board could also remove some of the presidents of the 12 regional banks, who are members of the Fed's rate-setting committee. The New York Fed president has a vote on the committee and four others vote on a rotating basis.",
      "Several of those bank presidents have expressed opposition to the deep rate cuts that Trump has demanded. The board of governors could seek to have them fired if a chair wanted to do so.",
      "While nearly all Fed chairs have left the board of governors before their terms were up, there is some precedent for Powell to stay. In 1978, then-Chair Arthur Burns stayed on the board for about three weeks after his chairmanship ended. But in 1948, then-Fed chairman Marriner Eccles remained as a governor for three years after finishing as chair, in part because President Harry Truman asked him to remain.",
      "In 1951, however, he played a key role in undercutting the Truman administration in a dispute over interest rates, which led to the Fed-Treasury Accord that established the modern Fed as a largely independent institution.",
      "Eccles became a symbol of Fed independence, though some academics say that reputation is overstated. The Fed's principal office building \u2014- currently under renovation and at the center of the criminal investigation of Powell \u2014 is named after him.",
      "Truman then appointed a Treasury official, William McChesney Martin, to the Fed chairmanship and assumed he would do his bidding. Yet Martin defied Truman and raised interest rates. Years later, Truman ran into Martin in New York City and called him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d The Fed's second office building in Washington is named after Martin.",
      "\u201cSo it's a cautionary tale also for Trump, thinking he's going to get his own Fed chair in there,\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University who studies the Fed. \u201cMartin didn't do what Truman wanted.\u201d",

      "After more than 13 years at the helm of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d factory founded by George Lucas.",
      "The Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday that it will now turn to Dave Filoni to steer \u201cStar Wars\u201d into its sixth decade and beyond. Filoni, who served as the chief commercial officer of Lucasfilm, and Lynwen Brennan, president and general manager of Lucasfilm\u2019s businesses, will inherit the mantle of one of the movies\u2019 marquee franchises.",
      "Kennedy, Lucas\u2019 handpicked successor, had presided over the ever-expanding science-fiction world of \u201cStar Wars\u201d since Disney acquired it in 2012. She oversaw a highly lucrative but often contentious period in \u201cStar Wars\u201d history that yielded a blockbuster trilogy and acclaimed streaming spinoffs such as \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d yet found increasing frustration from longtime fans.",
      "Under Kennedy\u2019s stewardship, Lucasfilm amassed more than $5.6 billion in box office and helped establish Disney+ as a streaming destination \u2014 achievements that easily validated the $4.05 billion Disney plunked down for the company. But Kennedy also struggled to deliver the big-screen magic that Lucas captured in the original trilogy from the late 1970s and early 1980s, and her relationship with \u201cStar Wars\u201d loyalists became a saga of its own.",
      "While Filoni and Brennan will share leadership, Brennan is considered the more financially oriented executive. Filoni will have the creative reins. He\u2019s established himself almost entirely on the small screen, entering the franchise with the animated series \u201cStar Wars: The Clone Wars\u201d and creating the tepidly received Disney+ series \u201cAhsoka.\u201d Filoni, who first collaborated with Lucas on \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender,\u201d has also been an executive producer on \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d \u201cThe Book of Boba Fett\u201d and \u201cSkeleton Crew.\u201d",
      "Before joining Lucasfilm, Kennedy was one of Hollywood\u2019s most successful producers ever. In 1981, she co-founded Amblin Entertainment with Steven Spielberg and her eventual husband, Frank Marshall. She produced \u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u201d \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d trilogy.",

The third film, Abrams\u2019 \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d (2019), was widely panned by critics and fans, alike.",

      "Struggles over tone and vision have been frequent. The 2018 Han Solo spinoff \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d saw its directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, fired during production and replaced by Ron Howard. Most found the mixed-and-matched result blandly disappointing.",
      "More recently, Adam Driver, who played Kylo Ren/Ben Solo in the most recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy,\u201d divulged to The Associated Press last year that he and Steven Soderbergh had developed a Ben Solo film with Kennedy and Lucasfilm\u2019s support for two years before Disney chief Bob Iger nixed it. Fans were so irate that a plane was flown over Disney\u2019s Burbank studios with a banner reading \u201cSave \u2018The Hunt for Ben Solo.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, the only \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie of Kennedy\u2019s stewardship to win widespread and prevailing approval from fans was arguably 2016\u2019s \u201cRogue One.\u201d Gareth Edwards\u2019 spinoff was also a troubled production, leading to Tony Gilroy, eventual creator of \u201cAndor,\u201d overseeing reshoots. Yet despite that, \u201cRogue One\u201d \u2014 taking place within \u201cStar Wars\u201d but outside of the main Jedi storyline \u2014 might be the only film of Kennedy\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d reign that managed to both stay true to the space odyssey\u2019s tone and to break new ground.",

      "The North American International Auto Show in Detroit once dedicated an entire track on its coveted show floor to getting consumers comfortable with electric vehicles and charging",
      "DETROIT -- At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.",
      "But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.",
      "\u201cThe show will always reflect what\u2019s happening in the industry at the consumer level,\u201d said Todd Szott, chairman of this year\u2019s event and an auto dealer. \u201cObviously things have changed in the EV landscape.\u201d",
      "Some industry players say they're emphasizing \u201cconsumer choice\u201d in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe \u2014 especially China \u2014 electrifies.",
      "\u201cWhat we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,\u201d Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.",
      "Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold \u2014 a slight decline from 2024.)",
      "None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.",
      "\u201cAmong my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don\u2019t have to have an electric car,\u201d Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.",
      "Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation\u2019s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards \u2014 going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them \u2014 and gas mileage rules.",
      "\u201cI love electric cars. I think they\u2019re great,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.",
      "Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments.

      "Climate change is driving a global boom in desalination as regions turn to the sea for drinking water",
      "CARLSBAD, Calif. -- Some four miles off the Southern California coast, a company is betting it can solve one of desalination\u2019s biggest problems by moving the technology deep below the ocean\u2019s surface.",
      "OceanWell\u2019s planned Water Farm 1 would use natural ocean pressure to power reverse osmosis \u2014 a process that forces seawater through membranes to filter out salt and impurities \u2014 and produce up to 60 million gallons (nearly 225 million liters) of freshwater daily. Desalination is energy intensive, with plants worldwide producing between 500 and 850 million tons of carbon emissions annually \u2014 approaching the roughly 880 million tons emitted by the entire global aviation industry.",
      "OceanWell claims its deep sea approach \u2014 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the water's surface \u2014 would cut energy use by about 40% compared to conventional plants while also tackling the other major environmental problems plaguing traditional desalination: the highly concentrated brine discharged back into the ocean, where it can harm seafloor habitats, including coral reefs, and the intake systems that trap and kill fish larvae, plankton and other organisms at the base of the marine food web.",
      "\u201cThe freshwater future of the world is going to come from the ocean,\u201d said OceanWell CEO Robert Bergstrom. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to ask the ocean to pay for it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an ambitious promise at a time when the world desperately needs alternatives. As climate change intensifies droughts, disrupts rainfall patterns and fuels wildfires, more regions are turning to the sea for drinking water. For many countries, particularly in the arid Middle East, parts of Africa and Pacific island nations, desalination isn\u2019t optional \u2014 there simply isn\u2019t enough freshwater to meet demand. More than 20,000 plants now operate worldwide, and the industry has been expanding at about 7% annually since 2010.",
      "\u201cWith aridity and climate change issues increasing, desalination will become more and more prevalent as a key technology globally,\u201d said Peiying Hong, a professor of environmental science and engineering at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But scientists warn that as desalination scales, the cumulative damage to coastal ecosystems \u2014 many already under pressure from warming waters and pollution \u2014 could intensify.",
      "Some companies are powering plants with renewable energy, while others are developing more efficient membrane technology to reduce energy consumption. Still others are moving the technology underwater entirely. Norway-based Flocean and Netherlands-based Waterise have tested subsea desalination systems and are working toward commercial deployment. Beyond southern California, OceanWell has signed an agreement to test its system in Nice, France \u2014 another region facing intensifying droughts and wildfires \u2014 beginning this year.",
      "For now, its technology remains in development. A single prototype operates in the Las Virgenes Reservoir where the local water district has partnered with the company in hopes of diversifying its water supply. If successful, the reverse osmosis pods would eventually float above the sea floor in the Santa Monica Bay, anchored with minimal concrete footprint, while an underwater pipeline would transport freshwater to shore. The system would use screens designed to keep out even microscopic plankton and would produce less concentrated brine discharge.",
      "Gregory Pierce, director of UCLA\u2019s Water Resources Group, said deep sea desalination appears promising from an environmental and technical standpoint, but the real test will be cost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost always much higher than you project\u201d with new technologies, he said. \u201cSo that, I think, will be the make or break for the technology.\u201d",
      "Las Virgenes Reservoir serves about 70,000 residents in western Los Angeles County. Nearly all the water originates in the northern Sierra Nevada and is pumped some 400 miles (640 kilometers) over the Tehachapi Mountains \u2014 a journey that requires massive amounts of energy. During years of low rainfall and snowpack in the Sierra, the reservoir and communities it serves suffer.",
      "About 100 miles (160 kilometers) down the coast, the Carlsbad Desalination Plant has become a focal point in the state\u2019s debate over desalination\u2019s environmental tradeoffs.",
      "The plant came online in 2015 as the largest seawater desalination facility in North America. Capable of producing up to 54 million gallons (204 million liters) of drinking water daily, it supplies about 10% of San Diego County\u2019s water \u2014 enough for roughly 400,000 households.",
      "In Southern California, intensifying droughts and wildfires have exposed the region\u2019s precarious water supply. Agricultural expansion and population growth have depleted local groundwater reserves, leaving cities dependent on imported water. San Diego imports roughly 90% of its supply from the Colorado River and Northern California \u2014 sources that are becoming increasingly strained by climate change. Desalination was pitched as a solution: a local, drought-proof source of drinking water drawn from the Pacific Ocean.",
      "But environmental groups have argued the plant\u2019s seawater intake and brine discharge pose risks to marine life, while its high energy demands drive up water bills and worsen climate change. Before the plant came online, environmental organizations filed more than a dozen legal challenges and regulatory disputes. Most were dismissed but some resulted in changes to the project\u2019s design and permits.",

      "\u201cIt sucks in a tremendous amount of water, and with that, sea life,\u201d said Patrick McDonough, a senior attorney with San Diego Coastkeeper, which has participated in multiple legal challenges to the project. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking fish, turtles, birds, but larvae and spores \u2014 entire ecosystems.\u201d",
      "A 2009 Regional Water Quality Control Board order estimated the plant would entrap some 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of fish daily and required offsetting those impacts by restoring wetlands elsewhere. Seventeen years later, that restoration remains incomplete. And a 2019 study found the plant\u2019s brine discharge raises offshore salinity above permitted levels, though it detected no significant biological changes \u2014 likely because the site had already been heavily altered by decades of industrial activity from a neighboring power plant.",
      "Those impacts are especially acute in California, where roughly 95% of coastal wetlands have been lost largely to development, leaving the remaining lagoons as vital habitats for fish and migratory birds.",
      "\u201cWhen we start messing with these very critical and unfortunately sparse coastal lagoons and wetlands, it can have tremendous impacts in the ocean,\u201d McDonough said.",
      "Michelle Peters, chief executive officer of Channelside Water Resources, which owns the plant, said the facility uses large organism exclusion devices and one-millimeter screens to minimize marine life uptake, though she acknowledged some smaller species can still pass through.",
      "The plant dilutes its brine discharge with additional seawater before releasing it back into the ocean, and years of monitoring have shown no measurable impacts to surrounding marine life, she said.",
      "Peters said the Carlsbad plant has significantly cut its energy consumption through efficiency improvements and operates under a plan aimed at making the facility carbon net-neutral.",
      "Many experts say water recycling and conservation should come first, noting wastewater purification typically uses far less energy than seawater desalination and can substantially reduce impacts on marine life. Las Virgenes is pursuing a wastewater reuse project alongside its desalination partnership.",
      "\u201cWhat we are looking for is a water supply that we can count on when Mother Nature does not deliver,\u201d Las Virgenes' Pedersen said. \u201cDeveloping new sources of local water is really a critical measure to be more drought and climate ready.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two senators from opposite parties are joining forces in a renewed push to ban members of Congress from trading stocks, an effort that has broad public support but has repeatedly stalled on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Republican Sen. Ashley Moody of Florida on Thursday plan to introduce legislation, first shared with The Associated Press, that would bar lawmakers and their immediate family members from trading or owning individual stocks.",
      "It's the latest in a flurry of proposals in the House and the Senate to limit stock trading in Congress, lending bipartisan momentum to the issue. But the sheer number of proposals has clouded the path forward. Republican leaders in the House are pushing their own bill on stock ownership, an alternative that critics have dismissed as watered down.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an American consensus around this, not a partisan consensus, that members of Congress and, frankly, senior members of administrations and the White House, shouldn\u2019t be making money off the backs of the American people,\u201d Gillibrand said in an interview with the AP on Wednesday.",
      "Trading of stock by members of Congress has been the subject of ethics scrutiny and criminal investigations in recent years, with lawmakers accused of using the information they gain as part of their jobs \u2014 often not known to the public \u2014 to buy and sell stocks at significant profit. Both parties have pledged to stop stock trading in Washington in campaign ads, creating unusual alliances in Congress.",
      "In the House, for example, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida is trying to bypass party leadership and force a vote on her own stock trading bill. Her push with a discharge petition has 79 of the 218 signatures required, the majority of them Democrats.",
      "House Republican leaders are supporting an alternative bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from buying individual stocks but would not require lawmakers to divest from stocks they already own. It would mandate public notice seven days before a lawmaker sells a stock. The bill advanced in committee on Wednesday, but its prospects are unclear.",
      "Gillibrand and Moody, meanwhile, are introducing a version of a House bill introduced last year by Reps. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas, and Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island. That proposal, which has 125 cosponsors, would ban members of Congress from buying or selling individual stocks altogether.",
      "Magaziner and other House Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, wrote in a joint statement Wednesday that they \u201care disappointed that the bill introduced by Republican leadership today fails to deliver the reform that is needed.\u201d",
      "The Senate bill from Gillibrand and Moody would give lawmakers 180 days to divest their individual stock holdings after the bill takes effect, while newly elected members would have 90 days from being sworn in to divest. Lawmakers would be prohibited from trading and owning certain other financial assets, including securities, commodities and futures.",
      "\u201cThe American people must be able to trust that their elected officials are focused on results for the American people and not focused on profiting from their positions,\u201d Moody wrote in response to a list of questions from the AP.",

      "Against tough odds, the European Union and four key South American countries are closer than they've been in 25 years to signing a long-delayed free trade deal",
      "CA\u00d1UELAS, Argentina -- Talks on a landmark free trade deal between the European Union and four South American countries started so long ago that the euro wasn\u2019t even in circulation, China hadn\u2019t yet joined the World Trade Organization and Venezuela was still America\u2019s top oil provider.",
      "But against a starkly different geopolitical background and tough odds \u2014 including backlash from powerful protectionist lobbies \u2014 the EU and the South American alliance known as Mercosur are expected to formally sign their quarter-century-in-the-making trade pact this Saturday at a ceremony in Paraguay.",
      "This is the first major trade agreement for Mercosur, which includes the region's two biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina, along with Paraguay and Uruguay. Bolivia, the newest member, was not involved in negotiations but can join the agreement in the coming years.",
      "The trans-Atlantic trade deal \u2014 lifting tariffs on products ranging from Argentine steaks and Brazilian copper to German cars and Italian wine \u2014 still has to be ratified by the European Parliament.",

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the deal last week as a powerful endorsement of multilateralism \"in the face of an increasingly hostile and transactional world.\" Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, 80, called it a rare \u201cvictory for dialogue, negotiation and the bet on cooperation.\u201d",
      "That victory comes at the expense of the U.S. and China, experts say, as Trump aggressively asserts American authority in the resource-rich region and Beijing uses its massive trade and loans to build influence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a signal that South American economies are seeking to hedge away from this great power competition between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Lee Schlenker, a research associate with the Global South program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington think tank.",
      "\u201cIt shows that South America can continue to flex its muscles in the international sphere, to diversify its trade partners and exert a certain level of autonomy it\u2019s often denied.\u201d",
      "The accord grants South American nations, renowned for their fertile land and skilled farmers, increased access at a preferential tax rate to Europe\u2019s vast market for agricultural goods.",
      "Here in Argentina, exporters reckon they\u2019ll save tens of millions of dollars a year thanks to the deal\u2019s immediate elimination of a 20% tariff on the EU\u2019s long-standing quota scheme for high-quality meat imports.",
      "It\u2019s a breakthrough for Argentina, a nation dominated for decades by left-leaning populist governments that kept the economy closed to the outside world and prioritized the domestic market to the extent of imposing taxes on farm exports to keep food prices down.",
      "\u201cWe're in the midst of a paradigm shift here,\" said Carlos Colombo, the president of Ca\u00f1uelas Cattle Market in Buenos Aires province where over 12,000 cattle are sold daily, many destined for Europe and China. \u201cArgentina has reopened itself to the world.\"",
      "Argentine President Javier Milei may be Trump\u2019s strongest ideological ally in Latin America \u2014 sharing his disdain for the United Nations and the Paris climate accord \u2014 but no one can call the radical libertarian a protectionist.",
      "At first he derided the notoriously slow-moving Mercosur as irrelevant and threatened to ditch it. But he changed his tune since realizing the bloc\u2019s potential to sweep away tariffs and slash customs red tape.",
      "\u201cHe sees this agreement as a way to revitalize and re-signify Mercosur,\u201d said Marcelo Elizondo, an Argentine economic analyst specializing in international trade.",

    "story": [
      "Press freedom advocates are concerned that this week's raid on a Washington Post journalist's home will deter reporting on government actions and silence whistleblowers",
      "If the byproduct of Wednesday's raid on a Washington Post journalist's home is to deter probing reporting of government action, the Trump administration could hardly have chosen a more compelling target.",
      "Hannah Natanson, nicknamed the \u201cfederal government whisperer\u201d at the Post for her reporting on President Donald Trump's changes to the workforce, had a phone, two laptops and a Garmin watch seized in the search of her Virginia home, the newspaper said.",
      "A warrant for the raid said it was connected to an investigation into a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified government materials, said Matt Murray, the Post's executive editor, in an email to his staff. The Post was told that Natanson and the newspaper are not a target of the investigation, he said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the search was done at the request of the Defense Department and that the journalist was \u201cobtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor.\u201d",
      "Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, has been working on press freedom issues for a decade and said a government raid on a journalist's home is so unusual he couldn't remember the last time it happened. He said it can't help but have a chilling effect on journalism.",
      "\u201cI strongly suspect that the search is meant to deter not just that reporter but other reporters from pursuing stories that are reliant on government whistleblowers,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cAnd it's also meant to deter whistleblowers.\u201d",
      "In a first-person piece published by the Post on Christmas Eve, Natanson wrote about how she was inundated with tips when she posted her contact information last February on a forum where government employees were discussing the impact of Trump administration changes to the federal workforce.",
      "She was contacted by 1,169 people on Signal, she wrote. The Post was notably aggressive last year in covering what was going on in federal agencies, and many came as a result of tips she received \u2014 and was still getting. \u201cThe stories came fast, the tips even faster,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Natanson acknowledged the work took a heavy toll, noting one disturbing note she received from a woman she was unable to contact. \u201cOne day, a woman wrote to me on Signal, asking me not to respond,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe lived alone, she messaged, and planned to die that weekend. Before she did, she wanted at least one person to understand: Trump had unraveled the government, and with it, her life.\u201d",
      "Natanson did not return messages from The Associated Press. Murray said that \u201cthis extraordinary, aggressive action is deeply concerning and raises profound questions and concern around the constitutional protections for our work.\u201d",
      "The action \u201csignals a growing assault on independent reporting and undermines the First Amendment,\u201d said Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at the advocacy group PEN America. Like Jaffer, he believes it is intended to intimidate.",
      "Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary at the beginning of his first term, said the concerns are premature. If it turns out that Natanson did nothing wrong, then questions about whether the raid was an overreach are legitimate, said Spicer, host of the political news show \u201cThe Huddle\u201d on streaming services.",

      "A law passed in 1917 makes it illegal for journalists to possess classified information, Jaffer said. But there are still questions about whether that law conflicts with First Amendment protections for journalists. It was not enforced, for example, when The New York Times published a secret government report on U.S. involvement in Vietnam in 1971.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s prerogative to pursue leakers of classified material,\u201d the Post said in an editorial. \u201cYet journalists have First Amendment rights to gather and publish such secrets, and the Post also has a history of fighting for those freedoms.\u201d",
      "The raid was made in context of a series of actions taken against the media during the Trump administration, including lawsuits against The New York Times and the BBC. Most legacy news organizations no longer report from stations at the Pentagon after they refused to sign on new rules restricting their reporting set by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Funding for public broadcasting has been choked off due to Trump's belief that its news coverage leaned left.",
      "Some news outlets have also taken steps to be more aligned with the administration, Jaffer said, citing CBS News since its corporate ownership changed last summer. The Washington Post has shifted its historically liberal opinion pages to the right under owner Jeff Bezos.",
      "The Justice Department over the years has developed, and revised, internal guidelines governing how it will respond to news media leaks. In April, Bondi issued new guidelines saying prosecutors would again have the authority to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to hunt for government officials who make \u201cunauthorized disclosures\u201d to journalists.",
      "The moves rescinded a policy from President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic administration that protected journalists from having their phone records secretly seized during leak investigations.",

      "The warrant says the search was related to an investigation into a system engineer and information technology specialist for a government contractor in Maryland who authorities allege took home classified materials, the Post reported. The worker, Aurelio Perez-Lugones, is accused of printing classified and sensitive reports at work and some were found at his Maryland home, according to court papers.",

Each fresh mourning for slain protesters expanded into a cycle of demonstrations. That ultimately ballooned to millions on the streets and pushed the monarch, fatally ill with cancer, to flee.",
      "Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in exile in France, returned to Iran and soon seized all levers of power under his vision of \u201cVelayat-e Faqih,\u201d or the \u201cGuardianship of the Jurist.\u201d Many fully didn't grasp what would come next.",
      "The execution of thousands of former government and military officials, writers, activists and others followed. So did a bloody eight-year war launched by Iraq. The imposition of the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, for women took effect. Soon came decades of tension with the United States \u2014 particularly after the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the 444-day hostage crisis that helped impact the outcome of an American presidential election.",
      "Iran's theocracy remembers those chaotic days after the revolution. And it's well aware of their potency today.",
      "In recent days, state television has aired archival footage of the early 1980s unrest. That was when fighters allied to militants called the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK, broke with Khomeini and were blamed for a series of major bombings and killings.",
      "Authorities also have recycled another phrase from the era when talking about those detained after the current protests, which began Dec. 28. Iran's attorney general and others call those being held \u201cmohareb\" \u2014 \u201cenemies of God.\u201d",
      "That charge carries the death penalty. It had been used along with others to carry out mass executions in 1988 that reportedly killed at least 5,000 people. Pro-government demonstrators have shouted: \u201cMarg bar monafegh!\u201d or \u201cDeath to the Hypocrites!\u201d That's another phrase from the 1980s long applied to the MEK.",
      "These references to the past signal something noteworthy: the concern Iran's government has for what's happening \u2014 and its efforts to try to change its description of the protests, which began with traders angry over the rial falling to 1.4 million to $1. By comparison, the rial traded around 70 to $1 when the 1979 revolution took place.",
      "Initially, Iran's reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, seemed willing to negotiate with demonstrators. The government drastically changed a subsidized currency exchange system that had been plagued by allegations of corruption. And it offered the heads of households the equivalent of $7 a month to cover skyrocketing food prices.",
      "But as soon as mass demonstrations swelled last week, Iran's theocracy reverted to a familiar playbook. It cut off access to the internet. It severed telephone lines abroad. Security forces engaged in what appears to be a bloody crackdown using live fire and other weapons to suppress the demonstrations, based on online videos and testimonies collected by activists.",

      "It remains unclear why exactly the bloodshed this time was so much greater than previous rounds of unrest, such as the 2022 Mahsa Amini demonstrations or the 2009 \u201cGreen Movement\u201d protests.",
      "The Associated Press' ability to independently assess the scope of the demonstrations and the violence that followed has been limited along with much of the rest of the world's by Iran's longtime restrictions on journalists and government communication blockages.",
      "But one factor may be that the protests touched on economic issues, something that cuts across the political, ethnic and religious divisions among Iran's 85 million people. Hard-liners may still be angry over the 12-day war, in which nuclear sites, missile arsenals and top military officials were targeted.",
      "Another possible reason: the size and scope of the protests themselves \u2014 particularly given that fact that authorities repeatedly warned the gatherings were illegal and signaled willingness to use force.",
      "Before the shah fell, for example, millions of protesters made it to the streets across the country during the holy Shiite mourning commemoration of Ashoura in December 1978. The monarch didn't restrict the processions, which included demonstrators screaming: \u201cDeath to the shah!\u201d That day ended without security forces shooting into the marches. The shah returned tanks and troops to the streets afterward, but it shook his resolve.",
      "This time around, Iran's government hasn't acknowledged the size of the demonstrations. But it did organize its own pro-government rally Monday that brought tens of thousands into the street.",
      "The theocracy also increased rhetoric against anti-government protesters, calling them \u201cterrorists\u201d and alleging Israel and the United States organized them, without offering evidence. The shah also famously accused \u201cIslamic Marxists,\" Communists and others for his woes \u2014 once going as far as saying: \"If you lift up Khomeini\u2019s beard, you will find 'Made in England' written under his chin.\u201d",
      "There are, of course, noteworthy differences between then and now. At the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled willingness to potentially use force to intervene. Western nations have condemned Iran, which remains choked by sanctions over its nuclear program and other issues.",
      "But if the years around 1979 offer a cue for January's demonstrations, they portend more troubles ahead for Iran \u2014 even if its theocracy believes it has put down the demonstrations successfully before they reach a point of no return.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran closed its airspace to commercial flights for hours without explanation early Thursday as tensions remained high with the United States over Tehran\u2019s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.",
      "The closure ran for over four hours, according to pilot guidance issued by Iran, which lies on a key East-West flight route. International carriers diverted north and south around Iran, but after one extension, the closure appeared to have expired and several domestic flights were in the air just after 7 a.m.",
      "Iran previously shut its airspace during the 12-day war against Israel in June and when it exchanged fire with Israel during the Israel-Hamas war. However, there were no signs of current hostilities though the closure immediately rippled through global aviation because Iran is located on a key East-West route for airlines.",
      "\u201cSeveral airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,\u201d said the website SafeAirspace, which provides information on conflict areas and air travel. \u201cThe situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defense, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.\u201d",
      "Iran in the past has misidentified a commercial aircraft as a hostile target. In 2020, Iranian air defense shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 with two surface-to-air missiles, killing all 176 people on board. Iran for days adamantly dismissed allegations of downing the plane as Western propaganda before finally acknowledging it.",
      "The airspace closure came as some personnel at a key U.S. military base in Qatar were advised to evacuate. The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait also ordered its personnel to \u201ctemporary halt\u201d going to the multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country.",
      "The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Iran at the request of the United States on Thursday afternoon.",

      "In comments to reporters, Trump said he had been told that plans for executions in Iran have stopped, without providing many details. The shift comes a day after Trump told protesters in Iran that \u201chelp is on the way\u201d and that his administration would \u201cact accordingly\u201d to respond to the Islamic Republic\u2019s deadly crackdown.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also sought to tone down the rhetoric, urging the U.S. to find a solution through negotiation.",
      "Asked by Fox News what he would say to Trump, Araghchi said: \u201cMy message is: Between war and diplomacy, diplomacy is a better way, although we don\u2019t have any positive experience from the United States. But still diplomacy is much better than war.\u201d",
      "The change in tone by the U.S. and Iran came hours after the chief of the Iranian judiciary said the government must act quickly to punish the thousands who have been detained.",
      "Activists warned that hangings of detainees could come soon. The security forces\u2019 crackdown on the demonstrations has killed at least 2,615, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency reported. The death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stared down everybody who said it couldn\u2019t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\u201d communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \u201cNow Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\u201d",
      "The figures, reported to Australia\u2019s government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.",
      "To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.",
      "About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \u201cdeactivated or restricted\u201d was encouraging.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.",
      "Australian officials didn\u2019t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.",
      "In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms \u2014 a concern that led to the ban's enactment.",
      "The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia\u2019s sprawling rural areas.",

      "Elon Musk's AI assistant, Grok, is facing scrutiny from governments worldwide",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's Grok keeps getting into trouble, and this time, more of the world's governments are trying to intervene.",
      "First launched in 2023, Grok is Musk\u2019s attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in building an AI assistant powered by a large language model, which is trained on vast pools of data to help predict the most plausible next word in a sentence. It's the main product of Musk's AI startup, xAI, which has been merged with his social media platform, X. Much like ChatGPT and Gemini, Musk's company has also folded AI image generation capabilities into the chatbot.",
      "Musk\u2019s deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics have repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, such as last year when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk\u2019s X social media platform. The chatbot was also found last year to be echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it would sometimes search online for Musk\u2019s stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "Beyond politics, Musk's vision of himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d has led to his company's more lax approach to sexualized images. Other mainstream chatbots block the creation of pornographic images. OpenAI had originally planned to enable ChatGPT to engage in \u201cerotica for verified adults,\u201d starting last month, but it has not done so.",
      "Here are some of the more recent controversies Grok has been involved in:",
      "Grok has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others, with requests such as \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "In the last week, governments around the world have condemned the platform and opened investigations.",
      "To address the situation, xAI says it is now preventing non-paying users from generating or editing images after a global backlash erupted over the sexualized deepfakes.",
      "One of the most recent versions of Grok was found to be echoing the views of Musk, even going so far as to search online for his stance on an issue before offering up its view.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, released in July, surprised some experts.",
      "In one example widely shared on social media and duplicated by a researcher, Grok was asked to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot sought out his guidance anyway.",
      "The chatbot told independent researcher Simon Willison that \u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "After Grok allegedly disseminated content insulting to Turkey\u2019s president and other Turkish figures, a court ordered a ban on accessing the platform last year.",
      "The chatbot posted vulgarities against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and personalities in response to user questions on X, a pro-government news channel reported. Offensive responses were also directed at modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, according to other media outlets.",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to boost production of rare earths and the other critical minerals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China's grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.",
      "It\u2019s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House\u2019s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.",
      "The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world's critical minerals. To break Beijing's chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China's playbook instead of a Republican administration.",
      "The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.",
      "Shaheen called the legislation \u201ca historic investment\u201d to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China\u2019s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is \u201ca much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.\u201d",
      "When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.",
      "On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone \u201cdeployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments\u201d to close six critical minerals deals that will \u201chelp free the United States from market manipulation.\u201d",
      "One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country's last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.",
      "Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country's only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.",
      "The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.",
      "\u201cDespite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,\u201d wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be \u201ca prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.\u201d",

That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.",

But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.",

      "In China, the names of things are often either ornately poetic or stunningly direct",
      "BEIJING -- In China, the names of things are often either ornately poetic or jarringly direct. A new, wildly popular app among young Chinese people is definitively the latter.",
      "It's called, simply, \u201cAre You Dead?\"",
      "In a vast country whose young people are increasingly on the move, the new, one-button app \u2014 which has taken the country by digital storm this month \u2014 is essentially exactly what it says it is. People who live alone in far-off cities and may be at risk \u2014 or just perceived as such by friends or relatives \u2014 can push an outsized green circle on their phone screens and send proof of life over the network to a friend or loved one. The cost: 8 yuan (about $1.10).",
      "It's simple and straightforward \u2014 essentially a 21st-century Chinese digital version of those American pendants with an alert button on them for senior citizens that gave birth to the famed TV commercial: \u201cI've fallen, and I can't get up!\u201d",
      "Developed by three young people in their 20s, \u201cAre You Dead?\u201d became the most downloaded paid app on the Apple App Store in China last week, according to local media reports. It is also becoming a top download in places as diverse as Singapore and the Netherlands, Britain and India and the United States \u2014 in line with the developers' attitude that loneliness and safety aren't just Chinese issues.",
      "\u201cEvery country has young people who move to big cities to chase their dreams,\u201d Ian L\u00fc, 29, one of the app's developers, said Thursday.",
      "L\u00fc, who worked and lived alone in the southern city of Shenzhen for five years, experienced such loneliness himself. He said the need for a frictionless check-in is especially strong among introverts. \u201cIt's unrealistic,\u201d he said, \u201cto message people every day just to tell them you're still alive.\u201d",
      "Against the backdrop of modern and increasingly frenetic Chinese life, the market for the app is understandable.",
      "Traditionally, Chinese families have tended to live together or at least in close proximity across generations \u2014 something embedded deep in the nation's culture until recent years. That has changed in the last few decades with urbanization and rapid economic growth that have sent many Chinese to join what is effectively a diaspora within their own nation \u2014 and taken hundreds of millions far from parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.",
      "Today, the country has more than 100 million households with only one person, according to an annual report from the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2024.",
      "Consider Chen Xingyu, 32, who has lived on her own for years in Kunming, the capital of southern China\u2019s Yunnan province. \u201cIt is new and funny. The name \u2019Are You Dead?' is very interesting,\u201d Chen said.",
      "Chen, a \u201clying flat\u201d practitioner who has rejected the grueling, fast-paced career of many in her age group, would try the app but worries about data security. \u201cAssuming many who want to try are women users, if information of such detail about users gets leaked, that\u2019d be terrible,\u201d she said.",
      "Yuan Sangsang, a Shanghai designer, has been living on her own for a decade and describes herself as a \u201csingle cow and horse.\u201d She's not hoping the app will save her life \u2014 only help her relatives in the event that she does, in fact, expire alone.",

      "\u201cSome netizens say that the 'Are you dead?' greeting feels like a carefree joke between close friends \u2014 both heartfelt and gives a sense of unguarded ease,\u201d the business website Yicai, the Chinese Business Network, said in a commentary. \"\"It likely explains why so many young people unanimously like this app.\"",
      "The commentary, by writer He Tao, went further in analyzing the cultural landscape. He wrote that the app's immediate success \u201cserves as a darkly humorous social metaphor, reminding us to pay attention to the living conditions and inner world of contemporary young people. Those who downloaded it clearly need more than just a functional security measure; they crave a signal of being seen and understood.\u201d",
      "Death is a taboo subject in Chinese culture, and the word itself is shunned to the point where many buildings in China have no fourth floor because the word for \u201cfour\u201d and the word for \u201cdeath\u201d sound the same \u2014 \u201csi.\u201d L\u00fc acknowledged that the app's name sparked public pressure.",

      "Then, a twist: Late Wednesday, the app team posted on its Weibo account that workshopping the name Demumu didn\u2019t turn out \u201cas well as expected.\u201d The app team is offering a reward for whoever offers a new name that will be picked this weekend. L\u00fc said more than 10,000 people have weighed in.",

      "The four returning astronauts \u2014 from the U.S., Russia and Japan \u2014 are aiming for an early Thursday morning splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego with SpaceX. The decision cuts short their mission by over a month.",
      "\u201cOur timing of this departure is unexpected,\u201d NASA astronaut Zena Cardman said before the return trip, \u201cbut what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Officials refused to identify the astronaut who needed care last week and would not divulge the health concerns.",
      "The ailing astronaut is \u201cstable, safe and well cared for,\u201d outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week via social media. \u201cThis was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists.\"",
      "Launched in August, Cardman, Fincke, Japan\u2019s Kimiya Yui and Russia\u2019s Oleg Platonov should have remained on the space station until late February. But on Jan. 7, NASA abruptly canceled the next day\u2019s spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke and later announced the crew\u2019s early return. Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.",
      "NASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight\u2019s end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.",
      "One U.S. and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.",
      "Computer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country\u2019s Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.",
      "It was the first spaceflight for Cardman, a 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian Air Force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA\u2019s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing\u2019s capsule problems.",
      "Fincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA\u2019s top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.",

      "\u201cI'm very happy personally that AI models are training on Wikipedia data because it\u2019s human curated,\" Wales told The Associated Press in an interview. \"I wouldn\u2019t really want to use an AI that\u2019s trained only on X, you know, like a very angry AI,\u201d Wales said, referring to billionaire Elon Musk's social media platform.",

      "The Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit group that runs Wikipedia, last year urged AI developers to pay for access through its enterprise platform and said human traffic had fallen 8%. Meanwhile, visits from bots, sometimes disguised to evade detection, were heavily taxing its servers as they scrape masses of content to feed AI large language models.",
      "The findings highlighted shifting online trends as search engine AI overviews and chatbots summarize information instead of sending users to sites by showing them links.",

      "The bulk of Wikipedia's funding comes from 8 million donors, most of them individuals.",

      "BANGKOK -- Iranian demonstrators' ability to get details of bloody nationwide protests out to the world has been given a strong boost, with SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service dropping its fees to allow more people to circumvent the Tehran government's strongest attempt ever to prevent information from spilling outside its borders, activists said Wednesday.",
      "The move by the American aerospace company run by Elon Musk follows the complete shutdown of telecommunications and internet access to Iran's 85 million people on Jan. 8, as protests expanded over the Islamic Republic's faltering economy and the collapse of its currency.",

      "\u201cThat showed a few hundred bodies on the ground, that came out because of Starlink,\" he said in an interview from Los Angeles. \"I think that those videos from the center pretty much changed everyone's understanding of what's happening because they saw it with their own eyes.\u201d",

      "The first units were smuggled into Iran in 2022 during protests over the country's mandatory headscarf law, after Musk got the Biden administration to exempt the Starlink service from Iran sanctions.",
      "Since then, more than 50,000 units are estimated to have been sneaked in, with people going through great lengths to conceal them, using virtual private networks while on the system to hide IP addresses and taking other precautions, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based organization that was responsible for getting some of the first Starlink units into Iran.",
      "Starlink is a global internet network that relies on some 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth. Subscribers need to have equipment, including an antenna requires a line of site to the satellite, so must be deployed in the open, where it could be spotted by authorities. Many Iranians disguise them as solar panels, Ahmadian said.",
      "After efforts to shut down communications during the 12-day war with Israel in June proved to be not terribly effective, Iranian security services have taken more \u201cextreme tactics\u201d now to both jam Starlink's radio signals and GPS systems, Ahmadian said in a phone interview. After Holistic Resilience passed on reports to SpaceX, Ahmadian said, the company pushed a firmware update that helped circumvent the new countermeasures.",
      "Security services also rely on informers to tell them who might be using Starlink, search internet and social media traffic for signs it has been used, and there have been reports they have raided apartments with satellite dishes.",
      "\u201cThere has always been a cat-and-mouse game,\u201d said Ahmadian, who fled Iran himself in 2012, after serving time in prison for student activism. \u201cThe government is using every tool in its toolbox.\u201d",

      "A proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of California billionaires has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley and across the state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A proposed billionaires' tax in California has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley, with tech titans threatening to leave the state while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.",
      "A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state \u2014 a few hundred, by some estimates. Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
      "A large health care union is attempting to place a proposal before voters in November that would impose a one-time 5% tax on the assets of billionaires \u2014 including stocks, art, businesses, collectibles and intellectual property \u2014 to backfill federal funding cuts to health services for lower-income people that were signed by President Donald Trump last year.",
      "In a state with a vast gap between rich and poor, the plan has resulted in a tangle of competing interests at a time when both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to respond to economic anxiety driven by rising costs ahead of this year's midterm elections.",
      "An online war of words has tech leaders pondering a hollowing out of Silicon Valley, and millions of dollars are flowing to political committees engaged in the fight. That includes $3 million from billionaire Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, to a committee tied to a business group opposing the tax.",
      "However it's not clear if the proposal will make the ballot, with more than 870,000 petition signatures required for it to qualify.",
      "Although the tax would affect only a minuscule slice of California's roughly 39 million residents, it would siphon money from an immense pool of wealth. If would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of Jan. 1.",
      "At least 25 billionaires listed among Forbes magazine\u2019s 2025 rankings of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people either lived in California or had some significant ties to the state, based on a review by The Associated Press. But determining whether they were full-time residents or just frequent visitors could turn into a matter of dispute, since many of them own property elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou are really playing with fire with this one,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of the publicly traded Silicon Valley company Box. He fears that the proposed tax would drive entrepreneurs to look elsewhere to run their companies and launch startups.",
      "Even liberal-leaning tech pioneers would \u201cfind it absurd just on pure economic and structural grounds, even if they might agree that the cause itself is very worthy,\u201d said Levie, who is not a billionaire.",
      "Newsom has long opposed state-level wealth taxes, believing such levies would be disadvantageous for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy. At a time when California is strapped for cash and he is considering a 2028 presidential run, he is trying to block the proposal before it reaches the ballot.",
      "Analysts say an exodus of billionaires could mean a loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why Newsom\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is not going to be an easy one,\u201d Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing a (budget) deficit the size of which is uncertain ... and in the years to come, a billionaires tax that could backfire badly.\u201d",

      "The tax is a \u201cworkable response to a crisis created by Congress,\u201d Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, said in a statement. She added that it would \u201ckeep emergency rooms open, hospitals staffed and health care systems functioning.\u201d",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "Starting on March 3, the livestreamed tours will be held weekly, on Tuesdays, with one in Italian and one in English, though more are foreseen. Groups are limited to a dozen people and require reservations, as well as an additional ticket beyond the typical Colosseum-Palatine Hill entrance fee.",
      "The restoration of the House of the Griffins is one of 10 projects funded by the European Union in the archaeological park and is part of an effort to spread tourists out beyond the must-see Colosseum and Forum, which often get overwhelmed with visitors.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranians made phone calls abroad for the first time in days Tuesday after authorities severed communications during a crackdown on nationwide protests that activists say killed at least 646 people, giving a glimpse of life after being cut off from the outside world.",
      "Witnesses described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, burned-out government buildings, smashed ATMs and few passersby. Meanwhile, people remain concerned about what comes next, including the possibility of strikes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could possibly use the military to defend peaceful protesters. Trump also has said Iran wants to negotiate with Washington.",
      "\u201cMy customers talk about Trump\u2019s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concerns for his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.\u201d",

      "Several people in Tehran were able to call The Associated Press on Tuesday morning and speak to a journalist there. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was unable to call those numbers back. The witnesses said text messaging still was down and that internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.",
      "Anti-riot police officers, wearing helmets and body armor, carried batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, the witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who similarly carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces as well.",
      "Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, they said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, the witnesses added.",
      "However, shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began Dec. 28, was to open Tuesday. However, a witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said the security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media had not acknowledged that order.",
      "The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes. While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in their homes and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.",
      "On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.",
      "State television also read a statement about mortuary and morgue services being free \u2014 a signal some likely charged high fees for the release of bodies amid the crackdown.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement carried by state TV, praised the tens of thousands who took part in pro-government demonstrations nationwide on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis was a warning to American politicians to stop their deceit and not rely on traitorous mercenaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iranian nation is strong and powerful and aware of the enemy.\u201d",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s AI engine inside the Pentagon network",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \u201cmake all appropriate data\u201d from the military\u2019s IT systems available for \u201cAI exploitation.\u201d He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "As the ice gets thicker, and is more stable, workers apply subsequent layers of water with hoses. Messer attaches his hose to hockey sticks for easier spreading.",
      "What must absolutely be avoided is dirt, dust or frost \u2014 all of which can cause friction for the skaters, slowing them down. The goal is that when the skaters push \u201cthey can go as far as possible with the least amount of effort,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The Zamboni ice resurfacing machine plays a key role in keeping the track clean, cutting off a layer and spraying water to make a new surface.",
      "One challenge is gauging how quickly the water from the resurfacing machine freezes in the temporary rink.",
      "Another is getting the ice to the right thickness so that the Zamboni, weighing in at six tons, doesn\u2019t shift the insulation, rubber tubing or ice itself.",
      "\u201cWhen you drive that out, if there\u2019s anything moving it will move. We don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The rink got its first big test on Nov. 29-30 during a Junior World Cup event. In a permanent rink, test events are usually held a year before the Olympics, leaving more time for adjustments. \u201cWe have a very small window to learn,\u2019\u2019 Messer acknowledged.",
      "Dutch speedskater Kayo Vos, who won the men\u2019s neo-senior 1,000 meters, said the ice was a little soft \u2014 but Messer didn\u2019t seem too concerned.",
      "\u201cWe went very modest to start, now we can start to change the temperatures and try to make it faster and still maintain it as a safe ice,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Fine-tuning the air temperature and humidity and ice temperature must be done methodically \u2014 taking into account that there will be 6,000 spectators in the venue for each event. The next real test will be on Jan. 31, when the Olympians take to the ice for their first training session.",
      "\u201cEighty percent of the work is done but the hardest part is the last 20 percent, where we have to try to find the values and the way of running the equipment so all the skaters get the same conditions and all the skaters get the best conditions,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok due to its misuse in generating explicit images",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries to block Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, after authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images.",
      "The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk\u2019s social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "Regulators in the two Southeast Asian nations said existing controls were not preventing the creation and spread of fake pornographic content, particularly involving women and minors. Indonesia\u2019s government temporarily blocked access to Grok on Saturday, followed by Malaysia on Sunday.",
      "\"The government sees non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the safety of citizens in the digital space,\u201d Indonesia\u2019s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The ministry said the measure was intended to protect women, children and the broader community from fake pornographic content generated using AI.",
      "Initial findings showed that Grok lacks effective safeguards to stop users from creating and distributing pornographic content based on real photos of Indonesian residents, Alexander Sabar, director general of digital space supervision, said in a separate statement. He said such practices risk violating privacy and image rights when photos are manipulated or shared without consent, causing psychological, social and reputational harm.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ordered a temporary restriction on Grok on Sunday after what it said was \u201crepeated misuse\u201d of the tool to generate obscene, sexually explicit and non-consensual manipulated images, including content involving women and minors.",
      "The regulator said notices issued this month to X Corp. and xAI demanding stronger safeguards drew responses that relied mainly on user reporting mechanisms.",

      "Launched in 2023, Grok is free to use on X. Users can ask it questions on the social media platform and tag posts they\u2019ve directly created or replies to posts from other users.

      "An attempt by The Associated Press to request a comment through email to xAI resulted in an automated reply from the media support email address which stated, \u201cLegacy Media Lies.\u201d This was the same message received from a different email when asked for comment regarding the global backlash.",

      "NEW YORK -- Google said Sunday that it is expanding the shopping features in its AI chatbot by teaming up with Walmart, Shopify, Wayfair and other big retailers to turn the Gemini app into a virtual merchant as well as an assistant.",
      "An instant checkout function will allow customers to make purchases from some businesses and through a range of payment providers without leaving the Gemini chat they used to find products, according to Walmart and Google.",
      "The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual convention in New York, which is expected to draw 40,000 attendees from retail and technology companies this week. The role of artificial intelligence in e-commerce and its impact on consumer behavior are expected to dominate the three-day event.",
      "\u201cThe transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.",

      "Google, OpenAI and Amazon all are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking chatbot users from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer\u2019s website to complete a purchase. The race between OpenAI and Google has heated up in recent months.",
      "Before the recent holiday shopping season, OpenAI launched an instant checkout feature within ChatGPT that allows users to buy products from select retailers and Etsy sellers without leaving the app.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI influenced $272 billion, or 20%, of all global retail sales, in one way or another during the holiday shopping season.",
      "Google said the AI-assisted shopping features in Gemini only would be available to U.S. users initially but that it planned to expand internationally in the coming months. Shoppers initially only can make payments through the cards linked to their Google accounts but soon will be able to make purchases using PayPal, the company said.",

    "story": [
      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "Starting on March 3, the livestreamed tours will be held weekly, on Tuesdays, with one in Italian and one in English, though more are foreseen. Groups are limited to a dozen people and require reservations, as well as an additional ticket beyond the typical Colosseum-Palatine Hill entrance fee.",

      "The White House and a bipartisan group of governors are holding an event Friday taking aim at power shortages and price spikes from data centers for artificial intelligence",
      "The White House and a bipartisan group of governors are pressuring the operator of the mid-Atlantic power grid to take urgent steps to boost energy supply and curb price hikes, holding a Friday event aimed at addressing a rising concern among voters about the enormous amount of power used for artificial intelligence ahead of elections later this year.",
      "The White House said its National Energy Dominance Council and the governors of several states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, want to try to compel PJM Interconnection to hold a power auction for tech companies to bid on contracts to build new power plants,",
      "The Trump administration and governors will sign a statement of principles toward that end Friday. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cEnsuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump\u2019s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the mid-Atlantic region,\" said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to be at the White House, a person familiar with Shapiro\u2019s plans said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. Shapiro, a Democrat, made his participation in Friday\u2019s event contingent on including a provision to extend a limit on wholesale electricity price increases for the region\u2019s consumers, the person said.",
      "But the operator of the grid won't be there. \u201cPJM was not invited. Therefore we would not attend,\u201d said spokesperson Jeff Shields.",

In parts of the country, data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to the grid.",
      "Electricity costs were a key issue in last year's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state\u2019s utility regulatory commission. Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.",
      "Gas and electric utilities sought or won rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period a year earlier.",

      "As Attorney General Pam Bondi approaches her first anniversary on the job, the firings of career attorneys have defined her turbulent tenure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Michael Ben'Ary was driving one of his children to soccer practice on an October evening last year when he paused at a red light to check his work phone. He was in the middle of a counterterrorism prosecution so important that President Donald Trump highlighted it in his State of the Union address.",
      "Ben'Ary said he was shocked to see his phone had been disabled. He found the explanation later in his personal email account, a letter informing him he had been fired.",
      "A veteran prosecutor, Ben'Ary handled high-profile cases over two decades at the Justice Department, including the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a suicide-bomb plot targeting the U.S. Capitol. Most recently he was leading the case arising from a deadly attack on American service members in Afghanistan.",
      "Yet the same credentials that enhanced Ben'Ary's resume spelled the undoing of his government career.",
      "His termination without explanation came hours after right-wing commentator Julie Kelly told hundreds of thousands of online followers that he had previously served as a senior counsel to Lisa Monaco, the No. 2 Justice Department official in the Biden administration. Kelly also suggested Ben'Ary was part of the \u201cinternal resistance\u201d to prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey, even though Ben\u2019Ary was never involved in the case.",
      "As Attorney General Pam Bondi approaches her first year on the job, the firings of attorneys like Ben\u2019Ary have defined her turbulent tenure. The terminations and a larger voluntary exodus of lawyers have erased centuries of combined experience and left the department with fewer career employees to act as a bulwark for the rule of law at a time when Trump is testing the limits of executive power by demanding prosecutions of his political enemies.",
      "Interviews by The Associated Press of more than a half-dozen fired employees offer a snapshot of the toll throughout the department. The departures include lawyers who prosecuted violent attacks on police at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, environmental, civil rights and ethics enforcers, counterterrorism prosecutors, immigration judges and attorneys who defend administration policies. They continued this week, when several prosecutors in Minnesota moved to resign amid turmoil over an investigation into the shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "\u201cTo lose people at that career level, people who otherwise intended to stay and now are either being discharged or themselves are walking away, is immensely damaging to the public interest,\u201d said Stuart Gerson, a senior official in the George H.W. Bush administration and acting attorney general early in the Clinton administration. \u201cWe\u2019re losing really capable people, people who have never viewed themselves as political and attempted to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Justice Connection, a network of department alumni, estimates that more than 230 lawyers, agents and other employees from across the department were fired last year \u2014 apparently because of their work on cases they were assigned, past criticism of Trump or seemingly no reason. More than 6,400 employees are estimated to have left a department that at the end of 2025 had roughly 108,000, the group says.",
      "The Justice Department, for its part, says it has hired thousands of career attorneys over the last year. The Trump administration has characterized some of the fired and departed workers as out-of-step with its agenda.",
      "Ben'Ary left with unfinished business, including the prosecution stemming from the Kabul airport bombing and the national security unit he led at the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Left to pack his belongings, he posted a typed note near his door that functioned as a distress call, reminding colleagues they had sworn an oath to follow the facts \u201cwithout fear or favor\u201d and \u201cunhindered by political interference.\u201d",
      "But, he warned, \u201cIn recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making Americans less safe.\u201d",
      "_____",
      "Since its founding in 1870, the Justice Department has occupied elevated status in American democracy, sustained through transitions of power by reliance on facts, evidence and law.",
      "To be sure, there has always been a political component to the department, with lawyers appointed by the president.",
      "But even during turbulent times, when attorneys general have been pushed out by presidents or resigned rather than accede to White House demands \u2014 as in the Watergate-era \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\" \u2014 the department's rank-and-file have generally been insulated thanks to long-recognized civil service protections.",
      "\u201cThis is completely unprecedented in both its scale and scope and underlying motivation,\u201d said Peter Keisler, a senior official in the George W. Bush Justice Department.",
      "In his first term, Trump pushed out one attorney general and accepted another's resignation but the workforce remained largely intact. He returned to office seething over Biden-era prosecutions of him, vowing retribution.",
      "The firings began even before Bondi arrived last February. Prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team that investigated Trump were terminated days after the inauguration, followed by prosecutors hired on temporary assignments for cases resulting from the 2021 Capitol insurrection.",
      "\"The people working on these cases were not political agents of any kind,\u201d said Aliya Khalidi, a Jan. 6 prosecutor who was fired. \u201cIt\u2019s all people who just care about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "The firings have continued, at times surgical, at times random \u2014 almost always without explanation.",
      "Adam Schleifer, a Los Angeles prosecutor targeted in a social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer over past critical comments of Trump, was fired in March. The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported. Reuveni later accused the department of trying to mislead judges to execute deportations. Department officials deny the assertion.",
      "Two weeks after Maurene Comey completed a sex trafficking trial against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the New York prosecutor was fired, also without explanation. Like Ben'Ary, she penned a pointed farewell, telling colleagues that \u201cfear is the tool of a tyrant.\u201d Her father \u2014 former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent Trump target \u2014 uttered those same words after being indicted in September in a case that has been dismissed.",
      "Among the most affected sections is the storied Civil Rights Division. A recent open letter of protest was signed by over 200 employees who left in 2025, with several supervisors recently giving notice of plans to depart. The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes sensitive public corruption cases, has also been hollowed out by resignations.",
      "The Justice Department has disputed the accounts of some of those who have been fired or quit and has defended the termination of those who investigated Trump as \u201cconsistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most efficient Department of Justice in American history, and our attorneys will continue to deliver measurable results for the American people,\u201d the department said in a statement. More than 3,400 career attorneys have been hired since Trump took office, the department says.",

      "Desperate for lawyers willing to file criminal cases against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the administration in September forced out the veteran U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no experience as a federal prosecutor.",
      "Halligan secured the indictments but the win was short-lived.",
      "One judge later identified grave missteps in how Halligan presented the Comey case to a grand jury. Another dismissed both prosecutions outright, calling Halligan's appointment unlawful.",

      "Khalidi joined the department in 2023 in a group of new prosecutors hired to help with the hundreds of cases stemming from the Capitol riot.",
      "Upon Trump's return to the White House, she watched cases she prosecuted get dismantled by Trump\u2019s sweeping clemency for all 1,500 defendants charged in the riot, including those who attacked police.",
      "Less than two weeks later, a Justice Department demand for the names of FBI agents involved in Jan. 6 investigations triggered rumors of potential mass firings. Worried about the agents she worked with, Khalidi spent the day checking in on them. But as she started preparing dinner one Friday evening, she received an email suggesting she had lost her own job.",
      "Attached was a memo from then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordering the firings of prosecutors like Khalidi who'd been hired for temporary assignments but were moved into permanent roles after Trump\u2019s win, a maneuver Bove called \u201csubversive personnel actions by the previous administration.\u201d Neither the email nor memo identified the fired prosecutors, leaving them to guess.",
      "Khalidi grabbed a suitcase to collect family photos and other personal items she kept at work and rushed to the office, retreating with fellow shocked prosecutors to a bar where they received termination emails.",
      "The group of 15 fired attorneys later assembled to surrender their computers and phones, entering the same room where they gathered on their first day in 2023.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of us, our dream was to be federal prosecutors,\u201d Khalidi said. \u201cAnd so we had happy memories of that room, of being excited on our first day. So it was just kind of surreal to be back there turning in our stuff.\u201d",
      "The news came for Anam Petit, an immigration judge, during a break between hearings.",
      "Appointed during the Biden administration, she said she felt uneasy when Trump won but also figured her position would probably be safe because immigration judges bear responsibility for issuing removal orders for those in the country illegally, a core presidential priority.",
      "Petit arrived on September 5 bracing for bad news because it was the Friday of the pay period before her two-year work anniversary, when her temporary appointment was poised to become permanent. Though she said she had received strong performance reviews and had already exceeded her case completion goal for the year, she had grown anxious as colleagues were fired amid an administration push to accelerate deportations.",
      "She was in the courtroom between hearings when she learned via email she'd been fired. She left to text her husband, then returned to work.",
      "\u201cI just put my phone back in my pocket and I went into the courtroom to deliver my decision, with a very shaky voice and shaky hands, trying to center myself back to that decision to so that I could relay it,\u201d Petit said.",
      "Joseph Tirrell was concerned about job security as far back as last fall. As the department's chief ethics officer, he had affirmed that Smith, the special counsel, was entitled to a law firm's free legal services, a decision he sensed might rile incoming leadership.",
      "But he remained in the position and over the ensuing months counseled Bondi's staff in sometimes strained conversations on the propriety of accepting various gifts, including a cigar box from mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor.",
      "He was fired in July, just before a FIFA World Cup Final in New Jersey that Tirrell had said Bondi could not ethically accept a free invitation to. He was not terribly surprised, he says, when it was later reported that Bondi attended in Trump's box. The Justice Department maintains the invitation did not constitute a gift and that Bondi's attendance in her capacity as a FIFA task force officer complied with ethics rules.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of fear there just because I was fired and just because so many others were summarily fired,\u201d Tirrell said. \u201cAre you going to get fired because you provided ethics advice? Are you going to get fired because you have a pride flag on your desk?\u201d",
      "_____",
      "Trump was touting his administration's commitment to counterterrorism during his State of the Union address last March when he announced a success: the capture of an ISIS-K militant charged in a Kabul airport bombing that killed 13 American servicemembers during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Mohammad Sharifullah arrived the following day in the U.S., encountering Ben\u2019Ary in an Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom.",
      "Ben'Ary spent the next several months working on the case, but on Oct. 1, he was fired. It was the apparent result, he told colleagues, of a social media post he said contained \u201cfalse information\" \u2014 a reference to the one from Julie Kelly.",
      "The termination was so abrupt, he couldn\u2019t tell his colleagues where he had saved important filings and notes. Another prosecutor listed on the case, Comey's son-in-law, Troy Edwards, had resigned days earlier upon Comey\u2019s indictment. Once set for trial last month, the case has been postponed.",
      "In his farewell note, he observed that he was not alone, that in \u201cjust a few short months\u201d career employees like himself had been removed from U.S. attorneys offices, the FBI \u201cand other critical parts of DOJ.\"",
      "\u201cWhile I am no longer your colleague, I ask that each of you continue to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,\u201d Ben'Ary wrote. \u201cFollow the facts and the law.

      "On Friday, he plans to attend a ceremony in Florida where local officials will dedicate a 4-mile (6-kilometer) stretch of road from the airport to his Mar-a-Lago estate as President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.",
      "It\u2019s unprecedented for a sitting president to embrace tributes of that number and scale, especially those proffered by members of his administration. And while past sitting presidents have typically been honored by local officials naming schools and roads after them, it's exceedingly rare for airports, federal buildings, warships or other government assets to be named for someone still in power.",
      "\u201cAt no previous time in history have we consistently named things after a president who was still in office,\u201d said Jeffrey Engel, the David Gergen Director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cOne might even extend that to say a president who is still alive. Those kind of memorializations are supposed to be just that \u2014 memorials to the passing hero.\u201d",
      "White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said the TrumpRx website linked to the president's deals to lower the price of some prescription drugs, along with \u201coverdue upgrades of national landmarks, lasting peace deals, and wealth-creation accounts for children are historic initiatives that would not have been possible without President Trump\u2019s bold leadership.\u201d",

      "For Trump, it\u2019s a continuation of the way he first etched his place onto the American consciousness, becoming famous as a real estate developer who affixed his name in big gold letters on luxury buildings and hotels, a casino and assorted products like neckties, wine and steaks.",
      "As he ran for president in 2024, the candidate rolled out Trump-branded business ventures for watches, fragrances, Bibles and sneakers \u2014 including golden high tops priced at $799. After taking office again last year, Trump's businesses launched a Trump Mobile phone company, with plans to unveil a gold-colored smartphone and a cryptocurrency memecoin named $TRUMP.",

      "A federal judge in Minnesota on Thursday ordered the release of a Liberian man four days after heavily armed immigration agents broke into his home using a battering ram and arrested him.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan said in his ruling that the agents violated Garrison Gibson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.",
      "\u201cTo arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.\u2019s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,\u201d he said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has been ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota in what the department has called its largest enforcement operation. DHS says its officers have arrested more than 2,500 people since Nov. 29.",
      "Marc Prokosch, Gibson\u2019s attorney, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the judge's order. He had filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal, and called the arrest a \u201cblatant constitutional violation\" since the agents did not have a proper warrant.",
      "Gibson\u2019s wife was inside their Minneapolis home with the couple\u2019s 9-year-old child during the raid. Prokosch said she was deeply shaken by the arrest.",

      "Only days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices \u2014 the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.",

As it turned out, the second termination letter was sent in error. She and roughly 2,000 other grant recipients nationwide were notified later Thursday morning that their federal funding had indeed been restored.",
      "Woike's feeling of whiplash over the past two days has been a common experience for providers, state health agencies and Americans who receive services amid the Trump administration eliminating, then abruptly reinstating, grants that support some of the nation's most vulnerable people.",
      "It builds on what program directors say has become a pattern of uncertainty from this administration, which has repeatedly canceled millions of dollars in federal funding without notice and at times reversed course in decisions about what will and won't be covered. Woike said the unsteadiness makes it impossible for organizations like hers to make long-term plans.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s looking at expansion or really trying to ramp up services to meet the need in the community,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone is just retrenching, looking at putting aside every penny and every resource.\u201d",

      "On Wednesday, several organizations told the AP they were already making difficult decisions in response to the cuts, including laying off employees and canceling scheduled trainings.",
      "By Wednesday evening, news reports were suggesting the cuts might be reversed \u2014 but grant recipients hadn't yet been notified of the change. Some of them said they instead received confusing emails overnight that duplicated their termination notices or instructed them on how to to close down their grants within 30 days.",

    "story": [
      "The Defense Department says it is revamping the military newspaper Stars and Stripes to focus on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and eliminate woke distractions",
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and no longer includes \u201cwoke distractions.\u201d",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership. It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half of its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \u201ceditorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\u201d and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \u201cgoverned by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes \u2014 to effectively shut it down \u2014 before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that the Pentagon \u201cis returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters.\u201d He said the department will \u201crefocus its content away from woke distractions.\u201d",
      "\u201cStars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\u201d Parnell wrote. \u201cIt will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\u201d",
      "He said the department is committed to ensuring the outlet's legacy of reporting news that's important to service members.",
      "Stars and Stripes' publisher, Max Lederer, did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment. But Jacqueline Smith, the outlet's ombudsman, called Parnell's statement a surprise. She said Stars and Stripes reports on matters important to service members and their families \u2014 not just weapons systems or war strategy \u2014 and she's detected nothing \u201cwoke\u201d about its reporting.",
      "\u201cI think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\u201d Smith said. A longtime newspaper editor in Connecticut, Smith serves in a role created by Congress three decades ago to ensure that independence, and she reports to the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "It's the latest move by the Trump administration to impose restrictions on journalists. Most reporters from legacy news outlets have left the Pentagon rather than to agree to new rules imposed by Hegseth that they feel would give him too much control over what they report and write. The New York Times has sued to overturn the regulations.",

      "Federal immigration agents deployed to Minneapolis have used aggressive crowd-control tactics that have become a dominant concern in the aftermath of the deadly shooting of a woman in her car last week.",
      "They have pointed rifles at demonstrators and deployed chemical irritants early in confrontations. They have broken vehicle windows and pulled occupants from cars. They have scuffled with protesters and shoved them to the ground.",
      "The government says the actions are necessary to protect officers from violent attacks. The encounters in turn have riled up protesters even more, especially as videos of the incidents are shared widely on social media.",
      "What is unfolding in Minneapolis reflects a broader shift in how the federal government is asserting its authority during protests, relying on immigration agents and investigators to perform crowd-management roles traditionally handled by local police who often have more training in public order tactics and de-escalating large crowds.",
      "Experts warn the approach runs counter to de-escalation standards and risks turning volatile demonstrations into deadly encounters.",
      "The confrontations come amid a major immigration enforcement surge ordered by the Trump administration in early December, which sent more than 2,000 officers from across the Department of Homeland Security into the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Many of the officers involved are typically tasked with arrests, deportations and criminal investigations, not managing volatile public demonstrations.",
      "Tensions escalated after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman killed by an immigration agent last week, an incident federal officials have defended as self-defense after they say Good weaponized her vehicle.",
      "The killing has intensified protests and scrutiny of the federal response.",
      "On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota asked a federal judge to intervene, filing a lawsuit on behalf of six residents seeking an emergency injunction to limit how federal agents operate during protests, including restrictions on the use of chemical agents, the pointing of firearms at non-threatening individuals and interference with lawful video recording.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much about what\u2019s happening now that is not a traditional approach to immigration apprehensions,\u201d said former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Salda\u00f1a, who left the post at the beginning of 2017 as President Donald Trump's first term began, said she can't speak to how the agency currently trains its officers. When she was director, she said officers received training on how to interact with people who might be observing an apprehension or filming officers, but agents rarely had to deal with crowds or protests.",
      "\u201cThis is different. You would hope that the agency would be responsive given the evolution of what\u2019s happening \u2014 brought on, mind you, by the aggressive approach that has been taken coming from the top,\u201d she said.",
      "Ian Adams, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of South Carolina, said the majority of crowd-management or protest training in policing happens at the local level \u2014 usually at larger police departments that have public order units.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that your typical ICE agent has a great deal of experience with public order tactics or control,\u201d Adams said.",
      "DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement that ICE officer candidates receive extensive training over eight weeks in courses that include conflict management and de-escalation. She said many of the candidates are military veterans and about 85% have previous law enforcement experience.",
      "\u201cAll ICE candidates are subject to months of rigorous training and selection at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, where they are trained in everything from de-escalation tactics to firearms to driving training. Homeland Security Investigations candidates receive more than 100 days of specialized training,\" she said.",

      "He said police departments now try to open communication with organizers, set boundaries and sometimes even show deference within reason. There's an understanding that inside of a crowd, using unnecessary force can have a domino effect that might cause escalation from protesters and from officers.",
      "Despite training for officers responding to civil unrest dramatically shifting over the last four decades, there is no nationwide standard of best practices. For example, some departments bar officers from spraying pepper spray directly into the face of people exercising Constitutional speech. Others bar the use of tear gas or other chemical agents in residential neighborhoods.",
      "Regardless of the specifics, experts recommend that departments have written policies they review regularly.",
      "\u201cOrganizations and agencies aren\u2019t always familiar with what their own policies are,\u201d said Humberto Cardounel, senior director of training and technical assistance at the National Policing Institute.",

      "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams is facing questions about the launch of a new cryptocurrency token, which he claims will help support efforts to end antisemitism and anti- Americanism",
      "NEW YORK -- For a moment, Eric Adams was riding high.",
      "Fresh off trips to Dubai and the Democratic Republican of Congo, the now jobless ex-mayor of New York City was back in Times Square on Monday to announce his first initiative as a private citizen: a new cryptocurrency coin that would also serve to beat back antisemitism and \u201canti-Americanism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re about to change the game,\u201d he promised, without describing how, exactly, the digital asset would support those lofty ambitions. \u201cThis thing is going to take off like crazy.\u201d",
      "But after surging to a nearly $600 million valuation within minutes of its launch, the new coin, dubbed NYC Token, went into free fall, losing nearly 75% of its value by that evening. The drop came after an account linked to the token's creation withdrew $2.5 million worth of coins, according to the crypto-analytics firm Bubblemaps.",
      "Around $1.5 million was later returned, the firm said, though by then investor confidence had collapsed. To some cryptocurrency experts, the rollout had all the hallmarks of a \u201crug pull.\u201d The scheme \u2014 prevalent among celebrity-linked meme coins \u2014 involves insiders hyping an asset then quickly dumping their stakes, saddling amateur investors with deep losses.",
      "Others have suggested that Adams and his inexperienced team were themselves duped by savvier investors, who took advantage of a sloppy launch.",
      "The debate has found Adams back in a mode of damage control that defined so much of his one-term mayoralty: denying misconduct, attacking the press and facing scrutiny about the competence of his inner circle of loyalists.",
      "Through a former campaign spokesperson, Adams has released multiple statements in recent days clarifying that he had not profited off the token and had not moved investor funds, calling reports otherwise \u201cfalse and unsupported by evidence.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike many newly launched digital assets, the NYC Token experienced market volatility,\u201d the spokesperson, Todd Shapiro, said Wednesday. \u201cMr. Adams has consistently emphasized transparency, accountability, and responsible innovation.\u201d",
      "Despite claims of transparency, Adams has so far declined to reveal his partners in the token.",
      "But two people close to the project confirmed that Frank Carone, Adams' former chief adviser and one-time lawyer for the Brooklyn Democratic Party, was closely involved in the launch. The two people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they had been asked not to disclose the identities of people involved in the token's creation.",
      "One of Carone\u2019s former clients, Yosef Sefi Zvieli, a real estate investor linked to several Israeli hotels, was also part of its creation, Shapiro confirmed to The Associated Press.",
      "Zvieli, whose involvement was first reported by Business Insider, previously owned a college dorm in Brooklyn, which drew complaints from students of filthy conditions and neglect. After defaulting on his mortgage, Zvieli hired Carone as his attorney and was able to turn the troubled property into a city-financed homeless shelter.",
      "Their exact role in the token launch was not immediately clear, though at least part of Zvieli\u2019s job involved reaching out to influencers ahead of the debut. Neither he nor Carone appeared to have direct experience in cryptocurrency. Messages left with the two men were not returned.",
      "As questions around the launch swirled this week, Adams sought guidance from Brock Pierce, the billionaire crypto investor, and former \u201cMighty Ducks\u201d child actor, whose private jet he sometimes used as mayor.",
      "After looking into the project, Pierce said he was confident that \u201cno one has run off with anyone\u2019s money.\"",

      "Even within the largely unregulated world of meme coins, experts say projects promoted by politicians are especially prone to unsavory trading practices.",
      "The president of Argentina, Javier Milei, has faced fraud allegations for his own crypto promotion, which drew thousands of investors before swiftly collapsing. Coins launched by President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, also saw significant price fluctuations upon release.",
      "The number of accounts that invested in NYC Token were far less than those ventures, totaling just over 4,000 as of Thursday, according to Nicolas Vaiman, the founder of Bubblemaps, which conducted an analysis of publicly available trade records.",
      "Roughly 80% of those accounts had bought in during a 20-minute period before Adams had announced the coin but after it was made available for purchase, the analysis found. The window, Vaiman said, provided an advantage to insiders involved in the launch and other traders who pay close attention to new tokens.",
      "\u201cPolitical coins are driven purely by attention, and the crypto community is aware that attention peaks right after the launch,\u201d Vaiman said. \u201cPeople know you don't want to stick around, especially for such a vague prospect, like fighting anti-Americanism or antisemitism. What does it even mean? How are you going to achieve that in a token?\u201d",
      "The website for the coin says a \u201cportion of the proceeds\u201d will be divided evenly among three causes: antisemitism and anti-Americanism \u201cawareness campaigns,\u201d crypto education for the city\u2019s youth and a scholarship initiative.",
      "It does not detail which organizations will be supported, or what percentage of the proceeds will go toward charitable causes.",
      "Adams has disputed that any money had been pulled by the token's creators.",
      "He has said the appearance of withdrawals were the result of adjustments made by the designated market maker, an entity that buys and sells orders of a new token to ensure traders can make purchases without major price shifts.",
      "The market makers include FalconX, a well known digital asset broker. The company declined to respond to inquiries on the record.",
      "As of Wednesday, a majority of accounts that invested in the coin had lost money, according to the Bubblemaps analysis. Fifteen traders were down at least $100,000, while 10 had netted $100,000.",
      "Pierce said he was still hoping the project could be salvaged, adding that \u201cthe fate and outcome of this project will be determined in the coming days.\u201d",
      "But some in the crypto world had their doubts.",
      "\u201cIt could be a legitimate project with just a really bad rollout,\" said Benjamin Cowen, the founder of another crypto research analytics firm, Into the Cryptoverse. \"But the way it was launched didn\u2019t instill a lot of confidence. It\u2019s hard to regain trust in the crypto community.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor seven minutes \u2014 seven gut-churning, nauseating, disgusting minutes \u2014 he stood in that room close enough to touch him and he did nothing,\u201d special prosecutor William Fitzpatrick told jurors during closing arguments. The jury began deliberating Thursday afternoon.",
      "Former corrections officer Michael Fisher, 55, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Robert Brooks, who was beaten by guards upon his arrival at Marcy Correctional Facility on the night of Dec. 9, 2024, his agony recorded silently on the guards' body cameras.",
      "Fisher\u2019s attorney, Scott Iseman, said his client entered the infirmary after the beating began and could not have known the extent of his injuries.",
      "Fisher was among 10 guards indicted in February. Three more agreed to plead guilty to reduced charges in return for cooperating with prosecutors. Of the 10 officers indicted in February, six pleaded guilty to manslaughter or lesser charges. Four rejected plea deals. One was convicted of murder and two were acquitted in the first trial last fall.",
      "Fisher, standing alone, is the last of the guards to face a jury.",
      "The trial closes a chapter in a high-profile case led to some reforms in New York's prisons. But advocates say the prisons remain plagued by understaffing and other problems, especially since a wildcat strike by guards last year.",
      "Officials took action amid outrage over the images of the guards beating the 43-year-old Black man in the prison's infirmary. Officers could be seen striking Brooks in the chest with a shoe, lifting him by the neck and dropping him.",
      "Video shown to the jury during closing arguments Thursday indicates Fisher stood by the doorway and didn't intervene.",
      "\u201cDid Michael Fisher recklessly cause the death of Robert Brooks? Of course he did. Not by himself. He had plenty of other helpers,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga County district attorney.",

      "District Judge Carl J. Nichols, an appointee of President Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government\u2019s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind\u2019s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.",

Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not sufficiently explain the need for a complete stop to construction. That wind farm, called Revolution Wind, is nearly complete. It\u2019s expected to meet roughly 20% of the electricity needs in Rhode Island, the smallest state, and about 5% of Connecticut\u2019s electricity needs.",
      "Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York, with a hearing still to be set. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, plans to ask a judge Friday to block the administration\u2019s order so it can resume construction, too.",

Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.",
      "Empire Wind is 60% complete and designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor said the project was in jeopardy due to the limited availability of specialized vessels, as well as heavy financial losses.",

      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",

They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",

A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the court document.",

Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",

      "The criminal complaint states the boy reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield touched him three or four times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him, the complaint said.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "When interviewed by authorities, Busfield suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. He also said he likely would have picked up and tickled the boys, saying the set was a playful environment.",
      "The mother of the twins \u2014 who are identified only by their initials in court records \u2014 reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",

      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991. He is married to actor\u00a0Melissa Gilbert, who deactivated her Instagram account amid the allegations.",
      "Gilbert indicated through a publicist that she won't speak publicly at the request of attorneys for Busfield while the legal process unfolds.",
      "\"Her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.\"",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, one of the boys has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him.",

    "story": [
      "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.\u00a0 Adams said last year that he was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with an aggressive prostate cancer.",
      "Adams' ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced the news of his death during a live stream of his YouTube show, \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams.\"",
      "She read a \"final message\" from Adams on the show, in which he wrote that he had \"an amazing life\" and gave it everything he had. He urged people to \"be useful\" and said, \"please know I loved you all to the very end.\"",
      "Adams said on an episode of his show last May that he had \"the same cancer that Joe Biden has ... prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\"",
      "He made the announcement a day after Biden announced his own diagnosis.",
      "President Trump posted about Adams' death on Tuesday, calling him \"a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so.\"",
      "\"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance called Adams \"a true American original, and a great ally to the President of the United States and the entire administration.\"",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers until 2023, when it was canceled by most newspapers over comments by Adams that various publishers denounced as racist, hateful and discriminatory.",
      "Among other things, Adams referred to Black people as members of a \"hate group\" and urged White people \"to get the hell away from Black people.\" Newspapers such the Los Angeles Times and the USA Today network as well as distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced they would no longer work with the cartoonist or run his strip. Adams took to YouTube at the time to defend himself and disclosed details about the impact of losing business, saying he was likely to lose 80% of his income from Dilbert due to the cancellations.",
      "In the message Miles read on the show Tuesday, Adams said that he wanted to explain his life. He said he spent the first part of it focusing on making himself a worthy husband and parent as a way to find meaning, then later \"donated\" himself to the world and evolved from Dilbert cartoonist to \"an author of what I thought would be useful books.\"",
      "\"From that point on I looked for ways I could add the most to peoples' life, one way or another,\" he wrote.",
      "Poking fun at corporate culture and, later, \"wokeness\"",
      "Adams earned a bachelor's degree from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers. He drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.",
      "The first \"Dilbert\" comic strip officially appeared April 16, 1989, long before such workplace comedies as \"Office Space\" and \"The Office.\" It portrayed corporate culture as a Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were underappreciated.",
      "Adams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards for cartoonists. That same year, \"Dilbert\" became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.",
      "\"Dilbert\" strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series, with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.",
      "While Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of \"Dilbert\" saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's mindset.",
      "He attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women are treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone.\" In a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.",
      "In June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the \"Dilbert\" TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white.\" But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.",
      "Adams' views were reflected in some of his strips. In one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complains that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"",
      "Adams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry canceled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/enough-oprah-winfrey-on-her-weight-loss-lessons/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:48:08 -0500",
    "summary": "For years, she seemed powerless against a fluctuating weight problem, until new medications, and a new attitude, gave Oprah Winfrey a breakthrough. She talks with Jane Pauley about \"Enough,\" a new book co-written with Dr. Ania Jastreboff, about her weight-loss success.",
    "story": [
      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat.",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 14:13:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Gilded Age\" and \"The White Lotus\" has returned to Broadway in \"Bug,\" written by her playwright-actor husband. The two talk about their on- and off-stage partnership.",
    "story": [
      "Safe to say, after recent star turns in \"The Gilded Age\" and the monologue of the year about friendship in \"The White Lotus,\" Carrie Coon is having a moment.",
      "I asked her, \"Would you agree with me that where you used to say you're at the bottom of the A-List \u2026\"",
      "\"I think I used to say, 'The bottom of the B-List,' but yeah,\" she corrected.",
      "\"But don't we need to revise our assessment as where you are?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Coon. \"But the thing that's changed for me is that I was on 'The White Lotus,' and now I can be in a Broadway play. That wasn't true for me five years ago.\"",
      "The play is \"Bug,\" which opened just this past week. Coon is leveraging her newfound star power to play the demanding, harrowing lead role in this examination of paranoia, conspiracy, and loneliness. And she is adamant that her success should not obscure a larger, sadder reality of the theater these days: \"We live in a country that is fundamentally unsupportive of the arts. So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",
      "Besides, they have work to do, the kind that's most affirming for them: Work they can do together.",
      "Letts said, \"I needed somebody who understood what it means to be an artist in America.\"",
      "\"And I needed somebody who reminded me that it was important to be an artist,\" Coon said, \"and that it was powerful, and necessary.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 21:40:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant Friday for director and Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield to face a child sex abuse charge.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department filed a criminal complaint in support of the charge, which says a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "The child said the first incident happened when he was 7 years old and Busfield touched him three or four times. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8.",
      "The child's mother reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "According to the complaint, the child, which it identifies only by his initials, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him and woken up scared.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital. The child's parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It starred Elodie Yung as a Cambodian doctor who comes to the United States to get medical treatment for her son, witnesses a mob killing and ends up becoming a cleaner for organized crime.",
      "The show was produced by Warner Bros., which according to the complaint conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991.",

    "summary": "Some Americans are dropping their Affordable Care Act health plans after tax subsidies lapsed and their premiums spiked.",
    "story": [
      "As the window for Americans to enroll in an Affordable Care Act health plan closes in most states today, millions of Americans remain in limbo as Congress weighs whether to extend tax subsidies designed to lower the cost of Obamacare insurance.",
      "Congress has been locked in a showdown for months over the fate of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which\u00a0expired on Dec. 31. The\u00a0fight over the subsidies\u00a0was central to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which dragged on for six weeks.",
      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states. However, 10 states are offering an extended enrollment window to give residents extra time to select a plan.",
      "States with extended ACA enrollment deadlines, according to healthinsurance.org:",
      "California: Jan. 31Connecticut: Jan.\u00a0 31District of Columbia: Jan.\u00a0 31Massachusetts: Jan. 23Illinois: Jan. 31New Jersey: Jan. 31New York: Jan. 31Pennsylvania: Jan. 31Rhode Island: Jan. 31Virginia: Jan. 30",

      "Virginia: Jan. 30",
      "For those yet to enroll in an ACA plan, the higher costs are sure to be a consideration. Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",
      "\"Any changes to the ACA tax credits mid-year would complicate the logistics and slow down the reopening of enrollment and the premium relief,\" he said in a post.",

That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "story": [
      "The largest nurses strike in New York City history is underway after negotiators for five major hospitals and the state nurses union failed to agree\u00a0to a new contract by Monday's deadline.",
      "The New York State Nurses Association said\u00a0nearly 15,000 nurses are now walking off their jobs at five privately-run hospitals, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian in Manhattan, and Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.",
      "NYSNA said nurses at Mount Sinai started the strike at 6 a.m., while nurses at the remaining hospitals started picketing an hour later.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the strike amid worries it could jeopardize critical care for thousands of patients in the city.",
      "Montefiore said it was preparing for the strike to last multiple weeks.",
      "\"NYSNA's leaders continue to double down on their $3.6 billion in reckless demands, including nearly 40% wage increases, and their troubling proposals like demanding that a nurse not be terminated if found to be compromised by drugs or alcohol while on the job. We remain resolute in our commitment to providing safe and seamless care, regardless of how long the strike may last,\" Montefiore Senior Vice President Joe Solmonese said.",
      "A Mount Sinai spokesperson said, \"Unfortunately, NYSNA decided to move forward with its strike while refusing to move on from its extreme economic demands, which we cannot agree to, but we are ready with 1,400 qualified and specialized nurses -- and prepared to continue to provide safe patient care for as long as this strike lasts.\"",
      "Some nurses, however, did report to work despite the strike. Mount Sinai said 20% showed up on Monday.",
      "A statement from NewYork-Presbyterian said, \"While NYSNA has told nurses to walk away from the bedside, we remain focused on our patients and their care. This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment...We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city, enhancements to their outstanding employer-funded benefits and new measures that reflect our shared commitment to safe staffing and workplace safety. However, good faith bargaining requires compromise from both sides.\"",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",
      "Hochul also said she wants a deal made as soon as possible.",
      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to reach a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care. The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions, and workplace protections against violence.",
      "\"Health care workers are being stretched to their limits, and as workplace violence in hospitals is on the rise, nurses are asking simply for the basics,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the news conference with Mamdani.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\" All of the hospitals impacted called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement, accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",
      "Some hospitals in the area were able to\u00a0reach a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others previously pulled back their\u00a0strike notices.",
      "What the strike means for patients",
      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the state Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",
      "The bottom line for patients is that the hospitals will remain open and care will continue during the strike.",
      "Some family members of patients are concerned as the strike continues on Monday night.",
      "Nurses can't pick up prescriptions at Montefiore Hospital",
      "A video shows one nurse being denied access to the Montefiore Weiler Hospital while trying to pick up prescriptions.",
      "The nurse said employees' health insurance is through Montefiore, and they can only pick up medications from a Montefiore pharmacy.",
      "\"Additionally, many nurses live in the Bronx, and their families get their care from Montefiore. If their family goes to the ER or is admitted, they're saying we can't go visit them,\" the nurse said in a statement.",
      "The woman in the video tells the security guard she is contracted to receive medications only through this pharmacy.",
      "The guard says they should've made arrangements to pick up the medication before, as they knew the strike was happening on Monday.",
      "A Montefiore spokesperson said nurses who are on strike can request their prescriptions be delivered directly to their homes.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "The potential for a major nurses strike in New York City is growing by the minute, after major hospitals and the New York State Nurses Association failed to negotiate a deal before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "As a result, nearly 15,000 nurses could walk off the job\u00a0Monday at Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, unless something happens during the overnight hours and an agreement is reached.",
      "The union said Sunday at a news conference that a strike would begin Monday at 6 a.m. at Mount Sinai and 7 a.m. at other facilities without a new contract.",
      "Mayor Zohran Mamdani acknowledged the potential strike Sunday evening, posting a message on social media that reads, in part, \"We are prepared for any and all scenarios, including a strike ... No New Yorker should have to fear losing access to health care -- and no nurse should be asked to accept less pay, fewer benefits or less dignity for doing lifesaving work.\"",
      "Key issues for the union",
      "Leaders for NYSNA have said key sticking points in contract negotiations with Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian   involve wage increases, health benefits, protection from workplace violence, and safe staffing and patient safety.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "In a joint statement, the hospitals called the potential strike \"reckless\" and asked union leadership to reconsider.",

      "Montefiore said it was preparing for what could be a multi-week strike, while Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian said they're ready to safely care for patients if a strike occurs.",
      "\"Patients should not delay going to the hospital if they need care, while we are on strike,\" Hagans said.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership's reckless and irresponsible demands totaling $3.6 billion, including a nearly 40% wage increase, clearly put patients at risk; we are resolute in devoting whatever resources are necessary to safe and seamless care for our community,\" Joe Solmonese, Montefiore's senior VP of strategic communications, said in a statement last week.",
      "Some hospitals in the area have already\u00a0reached a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others pulled back their strike notices.",
      "\"Northwell Health is pleased to have reached tentative agreements with NYSNA ... at Huntington, Plainview and Syosset hospitals. From the start of negotiations, our goal has been to reach a fair contract that supports our valued nurses and upholds the high standard of care our patients and community trust,\" a statement from Northwell said.",
      "Hochul signs executive order",
      "In a video posted Friday on social media, Gov. Kathy Hochul encouraged both sides to remain at the bargaining table and strike a deal. The governor also signed an executive order for the Department of Health to ensure hospital contingency plans in the event of a strike.  She later released the following statement:",
      "\"My team and I have been in regular communication with both NYSNA and hospital leadership for weeks, and that work has led to real progress. Eleven hospital systems have either reached agreements or agreed not to proceed with strikes at this time,\" Hochul said.",
      "\"While negotiations will continue, we expect strikes to begin tomorrow at three hospital systems in Manhattan and the Bronx. If strikes move forward, the Department of Health will have staff on site at all affected hospitals beginning tomorrow morning and for the duration of the strike to ensure patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "\"My top priority is protecting patients and ensuring they can access the care they need. At the same time, we must reach an agreement that recognizes the essential work nurses do every day on the front lines of our healthcare system.",
      "\"This weekend, I signed a two-week Executive Order allowing hospital systems to access resources to maintain patient care.  \"I continue to urge both sides to remain at the table and reach an agreement as soon as possible.\"",
      "Public supportive of nurses' demands -- to a point",
      "Some New Yorkers who spoke to CBS News New York said they are are supportive, but others worry about what a work stoppage would mean for patients.",
      "\"A strike is a last resort. So when it comes down to decisions to strike, that's a big deal and the public should be paying attention to that and realizing that we depend on health care workers,\" said Kaidee Akullo, who was visiting New York City from Philadelphia.",
      "\"I would say I support their decision to fight for what they deserve, but not at the cost of lives,\" an Upper West Side resident said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:46:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The average interest rate on a typical mortgage dipped to 6.06%, the lowest level since September 2022, according to Freddie Mac.",
    "story": [
      "The average interest rate on a conventional mortgage in the U.S. dropped to 6.06%, the lowest level in more than three years, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.",
      "A recent dip in mortgage rates has spurred homebuying activity, with purchase applications on the rise and more owners acting to refinance their loans, according to the government-sponsored enterprise.",
      "A year ago, the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.04%. The last time the rate on a typical mortgage was lower was Sept. 15, 2022, when it was at 6.02%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week, dropping to 5.38% from 5.46% last week. A year ago, that average rate was at 6.27%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates began ticking down in July in anticipation of a series of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which began in September and continued last month.",
      "Although the central bank doesn't set rates for home loans, trimming its benchmark rate often points to lower inflation or softer economic growth, spurring investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Although mortgage rates are easing, homeownership remains beyond the means of many Americans.",
      "A January report from Attom, a provider of property data, found that median-priced homes are less affordable than usual in 99% of the 594 counties for which sufficient data were available. The national median home price has hovered around $365,000, which is a record high, the group noted.",
      "\"Many Americans were priced out of buying a home in 2025, and affordability remains worse than historic norms in most markets,\" Attom CEO Rob Barber said in a statement earlier this month.",

      "Trump's housing proposals",
      "President Trump last week announced two measures aimed at promoting homeownership, proposing to bar institutional investors from buying homes and also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds.",
      "Experts said the proposed ban could ease pressure on home prices, citing research showing that large investors can drive up home prices in communities where they invest.",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, has estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points,",
      "Home prices have also surged because of a dearth of affordable housing. The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address that shortage,\u00a0according\u00a0to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Christy Bunce, president of mortgage lender New American Funding, told CBS News that more prospective buyers entering the market would drive up home prices.\u00a0 \"But I don't think we are in a market where we're going to see crazy appreciation,\" she added.",
      "Lower mortgage rates also present an opportunity for current homeowners to refinance their loans, Bunce added.",
      "\"It's a good time to refinance, because nobody has a crystal ball to figure out what rates are going to do in the future,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Erik Schmitt, a Chase Home Lending executive, said that homeowners \"may be able to significantly reduce their monthly mortgage payment or shorten their loan term\" as borrowing costs ease.",

      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",

Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",

    "summary": "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" said GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno, who previously expected the compromise to be unveiled this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican senators said Thursday that a long-sought bipartisan compromise to extend the expired Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits for two years has stalled.",
      "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, blaming Democratic leaders for the lack of movement on the issue. \"So for me, I'm going to take a pause until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader and his leadership team that they are willing to contemplate a deal that extends these enhanced premium tax credits with the reforms that we've outlined.\"",
      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Moreno \"is trying to distract from the reality.\"",
      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",
      "\"The only path forward at this moment is for Senate Republicans to do the right thing by the American people and pass the damn bill that we sent over to you,\" he told reporters at a news conference.",

    "story": [
      "New data shows more Americans are filing for bankruptcy, the latest indication that\u00a0price pressures\u00a0and an uneven economy are leaving some households strapped for cash.",
      "Total consumer bankruptcy filings jumped 12% from 478,752 in 2024 to 533,949 in 2025, according to Epiq AACER, a platform that provides U.S. bankruptcy filing data. Epiq, which tracks Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 filings, relies on data provided through the U.S. Courts' PACER system, an electronic database that houses federal court records.",
      "The surge in filings comes as American consumers \u2014 and businesses \u2014 face a slate of economic pressures, ranging from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs, experts told CBS News.",
      "John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, said Americans typically hold off on filing for bankruptcy as long as they can, meaning the conditions that led them to file for bankruptcy may not necessarily be tied to current economic issues.",
      "\"There is often a lag before economic conditions translate to higher bankruptcies,\" he said.",
      "Still, he said the rising cost of medical insurance, mounting credit card debt and the restart of student loan repayments are serving as some of the major catalysts for bankruptcies. Inflation has also made it tougher for Americans to cover expenses while paying down their debt, he added.",
      "\"There comes a point where the mounting bills, the increasing balances on credit cards, all those things just weigh people down so much,\" Rao said.",
      "A\u00a0December CBS News poll\u00a0found most Americans are struggling to afford basic living costs in the U.S., including health care, food and housing.",
      "A bankruptcy filing can provide consumers with a financial reset, stopping collection calls and wiping out some or all of their debt. But the relief comes with trade-offs: Bankruptcy can severely damage a credit score, delay the ability to buy a home and make it tougher to qualify for loans in the future.",
      "Commercial filings drift higher",
      "Commercial bankruptcies are also on the rise, with filings up 5% from 2024 to 2025, according to Epiq AACER's data. In 2025, consumers lost a number of national and regional retailers \u2014 including Forever 21 and Joann Fabrics \u2014 that failed to stay afloat even after seeking bankruptcy protection.",
      "Chapter 11 bankruptcies, which allow companies to restructure their finances, were up just 1% from 2024 to 2025, driven by higher interest rates in 2023 and 2024 along with inflation, according to Christopher Ward, the co-chair of bankruptcy and restructuring at Polsinelli Law Firm.",
      "Among the most notable recent filings is Saks Global, which filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman said it has secured financing that will allow it to keep stores open as the bankruptcy proceeds.",
      "Pre-pandemic normalization",
      "Experts emphasized that the increase in commercial and consumer bankruptcies represents a return to pre-pandemic norms.",
      "Bankruptcies dipped during COVID as an injection of government funding helped prop up cash-strapped businesses and American households. Forbearance plans also gave some mortgage payers and car owners more financial breathing room, said Michael Hunter, vice president of Epiq AACER.",
      "However, once those temporary relief measures faded, bankruptcy filings drifted higher, with data showing an upward trend since 2022.",
      "\"We're just slowly coming back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hunter said. \"Is it a huge event? No. Is it a big increase from what we've experienced over the past five years? Yes.\"",
      "While the overall number of bankruptcies is still below their pre-COVID levels, they could start to accelerate, Rao told CBS News.",
      "\"There's a good chance that filings will even be higher through this year and even into next year,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-tax-deduction-6000-impact-refund-aarp/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:07:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",
      "H&R Block notes that Americans who aren't yet receiving Social Security can still claim the $6,000 deduction.",

      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",

    "summary": "Grok faces mounting scrutiny from government officials and advocacy groups after people used the AI chatbot\nto create sexualized images of minors and women.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

    "summary": "The venerable retailer is seeking protection from its creditors after its $2.65 billion purchase of Nieman Marcus failed to spark growth.",
    "story": [
      "Saks Global filed for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, according to court documents entered in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, throwing the future of the roughly century-old high-end department store chain into doubt. Saks Global is the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.",
      "Saks also said it had secured a $1.75 billion financing package and that it would keep its stores open as the bankruptcy procedure plays out.",
      "Saks recently missed a debt payment stemming from a 2024 deal by its parent company, Hudson's Bay Company, to buy\u00a0rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus\u00a0for $2.65 billion, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in late December, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Swamped by debt",
      "Hudson's Bay raised $2 billion in debt to complete the Nieman Marcus deal, while Apollo Global Management affiliates provided an additional $1.5 billion in financing. Amazon also took a minority stake in Saks to facilitate the deal.",
      "\"The debt-fueled acquisition of Neiman Marcus always made bankruptcy a likely destination for Saks Global,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData. \"The only real surprise has been the speed of the collapse, which has come barely a year after the deal closed.\"",
      "Saks also missed a more than $100 million interest payment to bondholders, according to the Journal, which said the retailer has fallen behind on payments to vendors. Some suppliers have responded by withholding shipments, leaving Saks with thinner merchandise offerings.",
      "\"The truth is that Saks Global put itself in a financially precarious position that undermined the day-to-day operations of the business. A lack of cash meant suppliers went unpaid. This created inventory gaps which then drove customers away and caused revenue and cash generation to plummet,\" Saunders added.",
      "New York-based Saks launched in 1924, opening its first store in Manhattan, according to a historical account of the company posted on its website. The company expanded quickly between the 1970s and 1990s before it was purchased by Hudson's Bay in 2013. Saks's brands include luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman, which was acquired as part of the deal for Neiman Marcus; retailer Saks Off 5th, and home furnishings seller Horchow.",
      "8,100 store closures",
      "Saks appointed former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck as its new CEO, effective immediately.

      "\"If there is one positive from the bankruptcy, it's that the previous management team has been cleared out,\" Saunders said. They bear responsibility for the mess, and their reputation with vendors and associates at the firm is thoroughly tarnished.\"",
      "Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, said van Raemdonck is well-suited for his new role, having previously served as CEO of Neiman Marcus, which he led through bankruptcy.",

      "Brick-and-mortar retailers face ongoing competitive challenges from e-commerce giants like Amazon and \"fast-fashion\" sellers such as H&M and Uniqlo. More than 8,100 stores closed across the U.S. in 2025, up roughly 12% from the previous year, according to retail industry analytics firm Coresight Research.",
      "\"In general, brick-and-mortar retailers are not growing, so store closures would be somewhat positive for anybody that competes with Saks,\" Hynes said.",
      "What does this mean for shoppers?",
      "Saks Global is reorganizing, not liquidating, so its brands will remain in business for now. But analysts expect Saks to close some stores to save money on costly leases. The fate of the retailer's Fifth Avenue store remains unclear.",
      "When Saks missed payments to vendors, some brands stopped shipping new inventory, leaving its store shelves thinly stocked.",
      "\"Since Saks put in place a widely panned vendor payment plan, many vendors reduced, and as the year went on, stopped shipments to Saks,\" mergers and acquisitions attorney Jonathan Lazarow told CBS News.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration's tariffs caused a \"few-billion-dollar impact,\" but also praised them for \"leveling the playing field.\"",
    "story": [
      "As General Motors settles into its new Detroit headquarters, the automotive industry is facing challenging times as it contends with rising costs, shifting tariff policies and a fledgling electric vehicle market. GM CEO Mary Barra tells CBS News that, despite those challenges, \"I think we're on a good path\" and she is optimistic about the future of her company and the U.S. economy.",
      "The market for electric vehicles hasn't quite taken off in the U.S. just yet. Barra told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil Tuesday that GM is \"still committed\" to EVs, but thinks a major issue is that the industry was \"getting a little ahead of the consumer.\"",
      "\"A vehicle is such a big purchase for a consumer,\" she said. \"For many of them, it's the most expensive thing that they buy.\"",
      "\"I think we're on a good path. I think as there's more charging infrastructure, as we continue to get the cost of batteries down, I think consumers will pick an electric vehicle, because they're better,\" Barra predicted.",
      "Asked why the U.S. seems to be unable to compete with China in terms of making affordable electric vehicles, Barra said, \"I believe at GM we are.\"",
      "She said U.S. safety standards and other regulatory requirements are higher than they are in China and that China's auto industry is \"heavily subsidized.\"",
      "\"I think we can compete and have a better vehicle, and I think we're doing that,\" she said.",
      "But the cost of a new vehicle has continued to rise in recent years, and the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy has also added to that, Barra said.",
      "\"It had a few-billion-dollar impact last year,\" she said of those tariffs. But, she noted, it led to GM making changes, including bringing more production to the U.S., and praised the administration for making \"the playing field...a bit more level\" for U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"We worked with the administration and they took the time to understand our industry to make sure there wasn't unintended consequences so that we could still compete with some of the vehicles coming from other countries,\" Barra said. \"I think it was a shift that we're working through to get back. But I think '26 will be an even better year than '25, and I think the playing field is a bit more level than it was just, you know, 18 months ago.\"",
      "But consumer sentiment in the U.S. remains pessimistic, polling has shown, and the auto industry is often seen as a bellwether for the larger economy. Barra, however, said of a shaky year for GM and the economy, \"we really aren't seeing it.\"",
      "\"We think the market's gonna be about the same as it was last year,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Barra touted the \"tremendous number of vehicles\" that GM makes in the U.S., and when asked what it truly means for something to be \"American-made\" \u2014 considering many of the parts are often sourced from overseas \u2014 she said \"it starts with where the vehicle is designed. Where all the engineering is done.\"",
      "Barra said more than half of GM's vehicles are assembled in the U.S. and that a majority of the components are sourced from America. She also said GM is continuing its efforts to fill job positions in the U.S.",
      "\"One of the things we do is we work with the military, and as people are ending their service to our country, putting them in a training program so they can then work in our dealerships,\" Barra said. She also said GM has a \"very robust apprenticeship program\" for its factory workers.",
      "Asked about concerns workers may have about automation, Barry said GM has been using robotic assistance to help build its vehicles for decades.",
      "\"We focus on jobs that are either repetitive and maybe have ergonomic issues, so people get hurt doing them, so we focus on safety and we focus on ergonomics,\" Barra said. \"We also focus on, there's certain jobs that people don't want to do. We focus on that, and we look at how do we make each of our team members more efficient.\"",
      "She also noted there are some instances in which \"the precision of the job requires automation.\"",

    "summary": "Although there are signs that inflation is starting to ease, consumers still face pressures from high food prices and other costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in the final month of 2025, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from the prior month, capping a year when many Americans felt squeezed by price pressures.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.6% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, such as food and apparel.",
      "Inflation last month matched November's 2.7% annual pace, signaling that prices didn't ease further at the end of the year.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.7% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices jumped 3.1% last month, accelerating from a\u00a02.6%\u00a0increase in November, and the highest since August. Groceries have remained a sticking point for Americans who have had to stretch their budget to afford basic staples.",
      "For cash-strapped Americans, that could prove to be a pain point as we navigate a tricky economic backdrop.",
      "Ground beef prices jumped 15.5% compared with a year earlier, while coffee surged 19.8% and bananas rose 5.9%. One food staple that saw a price cut was eggs, which fell 20.9% from a year ago.",
      "The latest CPI reading closes out a year marked by economic resilience alongside lingering price pressures. Inflation stayed at or below 3% throughout 2025, well below the pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Even so, the CPI climbed for several months in 2025 in the wake of the Trump administration's tariff announcements, although the levies didn't reignite inflation to the extent that some economists had predicted. The tariff impact was more muted on inflation than predicted because many retailers swallowed some tariff costs rather than passing them on directly to customers.",
      "However, cooling inflation did not translate into price relief. Prices continued to rise, leaving many households feeling pinched and complicating efforts to save for retirement or buy a home.",
      "\"Inflation remains a challenge, with core PCE inflation holding above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for 55 months,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at investment firm Principal Asset Management, in a Tuesday email.",
      "The Federal Reserve cut rates three times in the final months of 2025 to counter a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the central bank's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said labor-market headwinds outweighed the risk of renewed price pressures. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28.",
      "What experts are saying",
      "While inflation isn't accelerating, it remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate, analysts noted.",
      "\"By most accounts, inflation is unlikely to drop to the 2% target in 2026, although it may gravitate towards that target, assuming that Fed independence stays intact,\" said Carla Nunes, a Managing Director within Kroll's Financial Advisory Practice, in an email.",
      "Analysts noted that core inflation was cooler than anticipated. The inflation measure, which excludes the food and energy categories, rose 0.2% in December, lower than the 0.3% increase expected by economists.",
      "\"Stepping back from the noise and volatility, core goods inflation appears to have peaked,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email note.",
      "While some measures signal inflation is cooling, Americans are still facing high costs in certain categories, including food and shelter.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" said Rob Holston, EY global and Americas consumer products leader, in an email.",
      "Taken together, today's inflation data and the latest jobs report, which showed a lower unemployment rate, are likely to keep the Fed on track to hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, experts say.",
      "Interest rate traders currently place a 95% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range when it meets in January, according to CME Group's Fed Watch Tool.",

      "\"He's been a lousy Fed chairman,\" Mr. Trump told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in an exclusive network interview Tuesday in Dearborn, Michigan. \"He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes.\"",

      "The costs of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters and a neighboring building have swelled to $2.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion. Mr. Trump said in the interview that he \"could have fixed them up for $25 million\" and said Powell is \"either corrupt or incompetent.\"",
      "The White House has denied directing federal prosecutors to investigate Powell, and Mr. Trump on Tuesday brushed off a question about whether the Justice Department probe amounts to political retribution.",
      "\"I can't help what it looks like,\" Mr. Trump told Dokoupil.",
      "Powell on Sunday attributed the Justice Department investigation to Fed officials resisting pressure from Mr. Trump to lower its benchmark interest rate. Mr. Trump, who nominated Powell to lead the Fed in 2017, has repeatedly accused the central bank chief of being too cautious in lowering interest rates.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-interest-rate-cap-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:19:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Capping credit card interest rates at 10% could save consumers billions of dollars, but potentially hurt lower-income Americans, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year could save consumers billions of dollars but hurt Americans with lower credit scores, according to financial experts.",
      "The idea, which drew rare support on Monday from Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, would prevent Americans from being \"ripped off\" by card issuers, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0last week in calling for the rate ceiling. By contrast, the cap has drawn pushback from the banking industry.",
      "After JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would punish consumers and dent the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The average interest rate on credit cards is now nearly 24%, according LendingTree. People with poor credit scores, meanwhile, can pay rates of up to 36%.",
      "Here's how experts say a 10% cap could affect consumers.",
      "Potential tradeoffs",
      "A September 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0from researchers at Vanderbilt University found that a 10% cap on credit card rates would save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments.",
      "With rates at 10%, a cardholder with a $5,000 balance would pay about $42 per month in interest. At the current average rate of 24%, they would owe about $100 per month.",
      "Some credit card analysts, along with the banking industry, contend that a 10% cap on credit card rates could lead to banks cutting off access to credit for low-income consumers and for those with low credit scores.",
      "\"They would find it dramatically more difficult to access credit,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News.",
      "That could take a toll on the broader economy because subprime consumers would likely pare their spending or turn to pricier types of credit. Credit card spending accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5%, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "For overall economic growth, that would effectively cancel out any increase in consumer spending stemming from lower credit card rates, the investment bank notes.",
      "The American Bankers Association also said in a statement\u00a0that a 10% rate cap \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" such as payday\u00a0or \"buy now pay later\" loans.",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, a site that helps consumers maximize their credit card rewards, said such programs could be diminished if the cap is implemented.",
      "\"Absent that lever and potential revenue source, we would likely see banks raise annual fees dramatically, or drastically reduce the value of their points and transfer programs,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Yet Shearer disputes claims that capping rates would cause card companies to cut off some consumers, forcing them to turn to riskier types of loans. Rather, credit card issuers are more likely to continue serving such consumers, but could sharply reduce the value of the rewards they offer them, he said.",
      "\"The credit card business is massively profitable, so it could absorb a significant cut,\" he said, noting that credit card issuers have a range of revenue streams.",
      "Issuers such as Visa, Mastercard and Capital One also make money by charging annual fees and on so-called interchange fees merchants pay to accept credit cards, which wouldn't be affected by the proposed rate cap.",
      "\"Claims from bank lobbyists that this would lead to account closures are greatly overstated, if not completely false,\" Shearer said.",
      "Why are credit card rates so high?",
      "Annual percentage rates (APR on credit cards are far higher than auto loan or mortgage rates because the debt is unsecured, Rossman explained.",
      "\"There is no underlying asset like a car or a home,\" he told CBS News. \"The risk to lenders is they aren't going to be paid back,\" he added, explaining the rationale behind double-digit interest rates.",
      "Card companies are also reluctant to reduce rates because that would mean smaller profits.",
      "The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 limits how much card issuers can increase rates, but does not put a cap on rates, while also reducing late payment and other fees.",
      "Can Trump really do this?",
      "Some experts think Trump may not have the authority to unilaterally impose a cap on credit card rates. Congress would also face challenges implementing such a cap, according to TD Cowan analyst Jaret Seiberg, although he thinks lawmakers could get behind a higher cap.",
      "\"This is where the risk rises as Democrats have sought to extend the 36% military lending cap to all consumers. It is why that could pass. Enacting a 25% cap would be harder as it could affect first-time credit card holders and subprime applicants,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Shearer said that a bipartisan\u00a0bill, the \"Percent Credit Card Interest Rate Cap Act,\" introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025 could pass if Mr. Trump's allies rallied behind it.",
      "\"It's not going to happen through executive action,\" Shearer said of a cap on interest rates. \"But if he can get the Senate majority leader and speaker to put it up for a vote, it's quite possible the bill would pass.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-market-trump-mortgage-rates-home-prices/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:25:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists say high home prices and a shortage of available properties may limit how much federal action can lower U.S. housing costs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump last week proposed two policies aimed at reducing the cost of buying a home, as soaring prices and elevated mortgage rates make homeownership increasingly unattainable for many Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and is also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to drive down mortgage rates for Americans.",
      "\"It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability,\" Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 8 social media post of the proposed mortgage debt purchase.",
      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates. But because many of those pressures lie beyond the federal government's direct control, it's unclear how much Mr. Trump's proposals could ultimately lower costs, according to experts.",
      "America's housing shortage",
      "Mr. Trump's approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes from institutional investors. Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

      "As Mr. Trump took to the stage, he touted the economy and also his victory in the 2024 election in Michigan. Mr. Trump called the event the \"easiest speech I've had to make\" because \"all I'm doing is spewing off what the hell we've done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended his administration's tariffs, saying he had closed the trade deficit due to the tariffs.",

      "Mr. Trump also said he would be rolling out a plan to deal with affordability when he is at Davos, although he has said that affordability is a \"hoax.\"",
      "On the international front, Mr. Trump spoke about his administration's military strikes on Venezuela and capture of its former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He attacked the Democrats who voted to advance a war powers resolution, saying they \"hate our country,\" and he also called out a few of the Republicans who joined them.",
      "Mr. Trump met with oil executives to push for U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil industry, and he said Monday that \"we're working with the Venezuelan people and representatives, and it's amazing\" for the country's oil.",
      "Veering off topic from the economy, Mr. Trump said, starting Feb. 1, his administration would cut off all payments to sanctuary cities and \"states having sanctuary cities because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens, and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come.\" Previous attempts to cut off funding from sanctuary cities have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized the fraud scandal in Minnesota involving dozens of Somali-American defendants, trashing Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, a staunch critic of Mr. Trump who represents Minneapolis and is Somali-American, saying she \"comes from a country with nothing and she comes here and she tells us about our Constitution.\"",
      "Walz last week dropped his reelection bid amid scrutiny over fraud in the state and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Mr. Trump said the recent immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which began shortly after a conservative YouTuber late last month published a video with\u00a0further allegations of fraud, has been successful in \"finding hundreds\" of criminals, and \"all we want to do is get them out.\"",
      "\"It's hard to get them out because they make it so impossible for you,\" he said. \"And you wonder, why? Why would they do that? You know, do they want to live with murderers, do they want to live with these people that are emptied out from prisons?\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention Renee Good, an American citizen who last week was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Mr. Trump and other high-ranking officials in his administration have repeatedly insisted the ICE officer was justified and that Good had instigated the shooting. Local officials and video footage of the incident have cast doubt on some of their claims.",

      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",

      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-interest-rates-credit-cards-housing-affordability/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:39:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, a 2023 Urban Institute\u00a0study\u00a0found.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

      "Justice Department subpoenas to the Fed threaten a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in\u00a0June 2025, Powell said in a video statement on Sunday.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",

Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund; ad Christina Romer, CEA chair under Obama.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the signers wrote.",
      "The statement signals that \"folks are unifying against this,\" Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Whether it changes the administration's mind is a tough question because it's a new source of pressure. But at the same time, it might amplify their resolve in seeing that the establishment is against this, so we must be right.\"",
      "Why Powell says he's being targeted",
      "The $2.5 billion project to renovate several Fed buildings, along with Powell's testimony about that effort, came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Powell had called some descriptions of the renovation \"misleading and inaccurate,\" disputing claims by the Trump administration that the overhaul included water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "In his video remarks on Sunday, Powell tied the investigation to Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates and undermine the central bank's independence.",

      "Lawmakers across the aisle spoke out in defense of Powell. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Banking panel, said on Sunday that he would oppose any of the Trump administration's nominees for the Fed, including to replace Powell.",
      "\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the investigation \"nothing more than an attempt at coercion.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a speech at the National Press Club on Monday that \"Trump is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.\"",
      "Powell's future at the Fed",
      "Powell is set to step down as Fed chair in May, but he could continue to serve as a Federal Reserve governor beyond that time. If he remains, the Trump administration would be deprived of the chance to fill another seat on the board.",
      "Powell has declined at several press conferences to answer questions about his plans. Asked on Monday by reporters if Powell planned to remain a Fed governor, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council and a leading candidate to become Fed chair, said he was unaware of Powell's plans.",
      "\"I've not talked to Jay about that,\" Hassett said.",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Machado previously said she wanted to \"share\" the prize for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado presented President Trump with her real Nobel Peace Prize medallion during her visit to the White House on Thursday, two White House officials told CBS News, and later at the Capitol, Machado confirmed she had done so.",
      "The medallion, which was not a replica, the sources said, was presented after Machado offered to share her Nobel Prize with him for what she said was his \"historic\" action of removing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed that Machado gave him the medal in a Truth Social post, calling it a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" He called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much.\"",
      "The White House late Thursday night posted a photo of Mr. Trump and Machado posing with the Nobel.",
      "The medallion was placed inside a gilded frame that read, \"In Gratitude for Your Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.\"",
      "Below the medallion was a certificate that stated: \"Presented as a Personal Symbol of Gratitude on behalf of the Venezuelan People in Recognition of President Trump's Principled and Decisive Action to Secure a Free Venezuela. The Courage of America, and its President Donald J. Trump, will Never be Forgotten by the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "The certificate was signed by Machado.",
      "Machado told senators on Capitol Hill she had an \"extraordinary\" meeting with Mr. Trump, according to a\u00a0post\u00a0from her spokesperson's office translated into English.",
      "Machado told reporters on Capitol Hill that she had presented Mr. Trump with the medal, and she suggested that in doing so, she was completing a kind of reciprocal gesture.",
      "She said she told him, \"Two hundred years ago, General Lafayette gave Simon Bolivar a medal with George Washington's face [on] it. Bolivar...kept that medal for the rest of his life.\" She added, \"When you see his portraits, you can see the medal there, and it was given by General Lafayette as a sign of the brotherhood between the United States, people of United States, and the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom against tyranny.\" Now, 200 years later, \"the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal \u2014 in this case, a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 as a recognition of his unique commitment with our freedom.\"",
      "Machado had floated the possibility of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump earlier this month. The president has not divulged details of their conversation.",
      "\"I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe \u2014 the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people \u2014 certainly want to, to give it to him and share it with him,\" Machado told Fox News host\u00a0Sean Hannity. \"What he has done is historic. It's a huge step towards a democratic transition.\"",
      "After Machado's offer to share the prize with the president, Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes clarified it cannot be shared or transferred. The Nobel Peace Center also said Thursday, \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"",
      "Machado was awarded the prize for being a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided \u2014 an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free elections and representative government.\"",
      "The Trump administration has said little about a democratic transition in Venezuela. The country's interim president is Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was Maduro's vice president. Mr. Trump spoke Wednesday with Rodr\u00edguez, calling her a \"terrific person.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday night, Machado said she told Mr. Trump during their meeting that Venezuela \"is ready to move forward swiftly and responsibly toward a democratic transition and toward a long-term relationship between the United States and Venezuela\u2014one that is mutually beneficial and puts people at the center.\"",
      "She said the two had a \"calm and in-depth discussion\" about the challenges facing the Latin American country. She also said she spoke to Mr. Trump about Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, the opposition leader who ran against Maduro in the disputed 2024 election, before fleeing the country. Machado was part of the coalition that supported Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's candidacy.",
      "In her statement, she referred to Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as the \"President-elect of Venezuela.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Machado to be Venezuela's next president, as some thought he might after Maduro's\u00a0arrest, despite the recognition she's received for her efforts to restore democracy to the struggling country. He has said he thinks it would be \"tough\" for Machado to lead Venezuela because \"she doesn't have the support within \u2014 or the respect within \u2014 the country.\"",
      "But Machado, asked in a recent\u00a0interview by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil if she believes she is the right person to lead Venezuela in the first chapter of its post-Maduro future, said that \"the people of Venezuela have already chosen,\" adding that her coalition is \"ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president \"was looking forward to this meeting and he was expecting it to be a good and positive discussion with Miss Machado, who is really a remarkable and brave voice for many people of the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "As for the president's assessment that it would be hard for her to lead Venezuela because, in his words, she lacks the support, Leavitt said \"at this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed.\"",
      "On Thursday morning, the Pentagon confirmed the seizure of yet another oil tanker in the Caribbean, at least the sixth such seizure of a tanker carrying Venezuelan oil.",
      "The U.S. officially began selling Venezuelan oil this week. The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500 million, has been completed, an administration official said Wednesday. Mr. Trump says the U.S. will be selling up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, if not more.",

      "Several key U.S. allies in the Middle East are aiming to stave off a military conflict between Iran and the United States by engaging in 72 hours of intensive diplomacy, a Gulf official told CBS News.",
      "The countries involved in the diplomatic push include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Oman, according to the Gulf official. The talks have focused on lowering the temperature in public rhetoric and avoiding military action that these states feared could trigger wider regional instability.",
      "To the U.S., the message has been to refrain from strikes on Iran, citing the region's security and economic vulnerabilities, while highlighting the risk that the U.S. could ultimately be affected as well.",
      "To Iran, the four Arab states conveyed that any counterattack on U.S. facilities in the Gulf would have serious consequences for Iran's relations with countries across the region.",
      "Thousands of American forces who are stationed in the Gulf region could be targets of potential Iranian retaliation in the event of a U.S. attack on Iran. The U.S. withdrew some personnel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar this week as a \"precautionary measure,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News on Wednesday that Iran explicitly informed a number of countries that they would be targets of an Iranian missile attack if the U.S. were to strike. The U.S. embassies in Qatar and Saudi Arabia told Americans on Wednesday to avoid going to military bases in those two countries.",
      "\"Collectively, there's an agreement that once this spirals into an armed military escalation, there could be lots of consequences,\" the Gulf official told CBS News. \"Tensions have cooled temporarily, but we've still yet to see. The next period will also be crucial.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Wednesday that many stories on Iran \"have been based on anonymous sources who are pretending or guessing to know the president's thinking.\" Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"continues to closely monitor\" the situation in Iran, and will \"keep all of his options on the table.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the White House referred CBS News to Leavitt's remarks.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly threatened to take action against Iran if its security forces continue their violent crackdown on the nationwide protests that have gripped the country \u2014 which raised expectations that the U.S. could carry out\u00a0 military strikes. Mr. Trump told CBS News on Tuesday the U.S. would \"take very strong action\" if Iranian authorities began hanging protesters.",
      "The president has been briefed on a range of options that can be used against Iran, including conventional airstrikes as well as cyber and psychological operations aimed at disrupting the country's communications and state media, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned Mr. Trump against military strikes, urging U.S. officials to \"halt their deceitful actions\" earlier this week. Iran temporarily closed its airspace overnight on Wednesday, indicating it may have been preparing for possible military action.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president suggested a military strike on Iran may not be imminent, telling reporters he'd heard the \"killing in Iran is stopping.\" Asked if that means military options are off the table, Mr. Trump said: \"We're going to watch and see what the process is.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke on the phone with Qatar's prime minister and Saudi Arabia's foreign minister on Thursday, the latter two countries announced on X.",
      "The diplomatic campaign comes seven months after Mr. Trump ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a days-long conflict between Iran and Israel. That conflict ended in a ceasefire after just under two weeks.",
      "So far, the latest round of diplomacy has not focused directly on any potential U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. The current efforts are aimed at preventing attacks or further escalation, with the goal of creating space for eventual discussions on a nuclear deal and other issues.",

      "Madison Sheahan, the No. 2 official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and close ally of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, is leaving the agency to run for Congress, two U.S. officials familiar with the move told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Sheahan was installed as ICE's deputy director in March, when the Trump administration overhauled the agency's leadership amid increased pressure for officials to ramp up immigration arrests and deportations across the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Noem confirmed Sheahan's departure. She said Sheahan would be \"a great defender of freedom when she goes to Congress,\" noting she has known her for years.",
      "\"Madison Sheahan is a work horse, strong executor, and terrific leader who led the men and women of ICE to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem added. \"We wish her all the best.\"",
      "While Sheahan and Noem have a longstanding relationship, her installation as the second-highest ranking official at ICE frustrated some agency officials, who noted the 28-year-old lacked significant law enforcement experience.",
      "Before coming to ICE, Sheahan was the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Before that, she was an aide for Noem during her governorship in South Dakota.",
      "In a message to ICE employees posted on X shortly after this story was first published, Sheahan said she was proud of having \"strengthened\" ICE and \"restored its purpose.\"",
      "\"As I depart the agency, I want to say that it has been the honor of my life to serve my country with all of you,\" Sheahan wrote in her message. \"I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Noem for their leadership and for their steadfast commitment to our agency.\"",
      "Noem announced Thursday that Charles Wall, who was recently the lead lawyer at ICE and was an ICE attorney for 14 years, will replace Sheahan as the agency's deputy director.",
      "As the agency in charge of deportations and immigration arrests in the interior of the country, ICE has been at the forefront of President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration.

    "summary": "Though DOJ says there's \"no basis\" for criminal civil rights probe in ICE shooting case, some legal experts say the division's lack of involvement here is unheard of.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since the fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent, a dozen Justice Department prosecutors and career officials have left their positions \u2014 some of whom have expressed frustration over the department's handling of the case.",
      "Senior U.S. Justice Department leaders have ordered federal prosecutors who specialize in probing civil rights crimes not to pursue an investigation into Good's shooting death in Minneapolis last week.",
      "The sidelining of the Civil Rights Division's criminal section is highly unusual, and appears to break with the Justice Department's own manual, which calls for its involvement in cases that are designated as being in the \"national interest.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CBS News in a statement that there's \"no basis\" for a criminal civil rights probe in this case.",
      "But numerous legal experts who spoke with CBS News disagreed, saying that the lack of involvement by the Civil Rights Division in a fatal officer-involved shooting like the one in Minneapolis is unheard of and deeply concerning.",
      "Six career officials in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section announced they will be departing, telling colleagues in a meeting that the handling of the shooting in Minneapolis marks the latest in a series of troubling actions to pull back on criminal civil rights enforcement in America by the department.",
      "At least six federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota have also quit, after they were pressured to investigate the wife of Renee Good and to treat the case as an assault on a federal officer.",
      "What does the Civil Rights Division's Criminal Section do?",
      "The criminal section of the Civil Rights Division is one of the Justice Department's oldest offices, dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era.",
      "In addition to prosecuting hate crimes, the section also handles cases involving local, state or federal law enforcement misconduct, which can include the use of excessive force and sexual misconduct.",
      "The use of excessive force by a law enforcement officer is typically prosecuted under 18 USC 242, a statute which makes it a crime for anyone acting \"under color of law,\" such as a police officer, to willfully deprive a person of their constitutional rights.",
      "The law can be used to prosecute a variety of misconduct allegations, from physical or sexual abuse, to making false arrests or failing to protect people in custody from having their rights violated by others.",
      "A violation of the statute is a misdemeanor, though if prosecutors can prove certain aggravating factors such as kidnapping, sexual abuse or death, they can seek life in prison or even the death penalty.",
      "There is no statute of limitations on cases involving excessive force that lead to death. In theory, the next\u00a0administration could still pursue a federal color-under-law criminal case down the road, as long as the target has not received a presidential pardon.",
      "Cases in the national interest",
      "The Justice Department's Justice Manual calls for coordination between the assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division and the local U.S. Attorney's office in cases that are deemed to be in the \"national interest.\"",
      "As a general matter, cases deemed to be in the national interest may involve novel issues of law or have important public policy considerations.",
      "A case like the one in Minneapolis, however, would automatically be deemed to be a \"national interest\" case under the Justice Manual because it involves an alleged violation of federal criminal civil rights laws that resulted in death.",
      "In national interest cases, the assistant attorney general for Civil Rights is supposed to make staffing decisions, and can choose whether to pursue the case jointly with a U.S. Attorney's office or as a stand-alone Civil Rights Division case.",
      "The manual also requires the U.S. Attorney's office in the relevant district, the FBI and the Civil Rights Division to coordinate and consult before any public statements are made to the press.",
      "U.S. Attorneys' offices must obtain prior approval from the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division before seeking an indictment on a civil rights case that is deemed to be in the national interest.",
      "Past cases involving use of force by law enforcement officer",
      "Most of the country's high-profile cases involving use of force by a law enforcement officer have involved the Civil Rights Division's criminal section.",
      "In Minnesota, the division prosecuted former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin for violating George Floyd's rights, resulting in his death.",
      "The federal case was pursued in addition to state charges against Chauvin. He was convicted of murder in the state trial and pleaded guilty in the federal civil rights case.",
      "The division also pursued federal charges against the Louisville Police Department officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, after they entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant. Former Kentucky police detective Brett Hankison was convicted of using excessive force in Taylor's death and sentenced to almost three years in prison. Another former Louisville officer, Kelly Goodlett, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy for helping obtain the warrant. Two other Louisville officers, former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany, also face charges over Taylor's death. Jaynes and Meany are charged with federal civil rights offenses and obstruction of justice for their involvement in the preparing and authorizing of an affidavit for the search warrant that ultimately led to the shooting.",
      "In one notable case, the Civil Rights Division's criminal section investigated and declined to bring charges against a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown.",

    "summary": "The legislation was unveiled after journalist Seth Harp shared a public biography that he said belonged to the commander of the Army's elite Delta Force unit.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan bill seeks to make it a crime to publicly share identifying information about special operations forces with the intent of threatening, intimidating or inciting violence against them.",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Budd of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are introducing the bill, first shared with CBS News, in the upper chamber Thursday. The bill is titled the Special Operator Protection Act.",
      "The move comes after a journalist shared a photo and brief biography of a military officer who he said was the commander of the elite Army Delta Force, which carried out the operation earlier this month to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Seth Harp, an Army veteran turned journalist who has been highly critical of special forces, said his X account was locked until he deleted certain posts.",
      "The legislation from Budd and Shaheen aims to protect special forces, other Department of Defense personnel who conduct sensitive missions, federal law enforcement officers who support special forces, as well as their immediate family members.",
      "It would prohibit publicly sharing identifying information of these service members, including their name, photo or image of their home in connection with their employer, birthdate, Social Security number, home address, phone numbers, personal email and biometric data.",
      "\"There is no compelling reason for their identities to be made public, especially given the significant risks from foreign threats,\" Budd said in a statement.",
      "Shaheen echoed the concern that they could be harmed by foreign adversaries, saying the bill \"would help shield those who put their lives on the line to advance America's national security.\"",
      "The penalties for violating the law would include fines and up to five years in prison. Death or serious injury to those whose information has been shared carries increased penalties, including up to life in prison.",
      "But the bill is also likely to raise questions about the ability of the press to report critically on military personnel.",
      "Harp has pushed back on allegations that he had \"doxxed\" the officer, saying in a lengthy statement that he had posted information that was publicly available online.",
      "\"I did not post any personally identifying information about him, such as his birthday, social security number, home address, phone number, email address, the names of his family members or pictures of his house,\" he said on Jan. 5.",
      "At that time, he said the information he posted was still available online \"for all the world to see.\" In defense of sharing the information, he said every \"civilian official and military officer in the American chain of command\" involved in the operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny.\"",
      "He told CBS News on Thursday, \"This law, if passed, would never survive judicial review. How can you criminalize naming high ranking military officials whose names are already publicly known, such as the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, or the Delta Force commander? Every officer at or above the rank of colonel has to be confirmed by Congress. It's nonsensical to make it a crime to name them when they're already public figures, named in the Congressional Record.\"",
      "Last week, the House Oversight Committee adopted by voice vote a motion to subpoena Harp. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida accused the journalist of putting the Delta Force commander and his family at risk and called for a criminal investigation into what she described as \"leaking classified information.\" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told CBS News on Thursday that Harp has not been subpoenaed at this time.",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department referring Harp for criminal prosecution, Luna said the incident \"raises serious concerns\" for U.S. national security.",
      "\"The gravity of such conduct is magnified by the foreseeable consequences, including the endangerment of U.S. personnel and, in this specific case, his family who have endured harassment and danger to their safety,\" the Jan. 7 letter said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it had received Luna's referral and said it \"takes protecting the safety and security of our military personnel extremely seriously.\" Harp told CBS News the Justice Department has not reached out to him.",
      "Harp has maintained that the commander's identity is not classified. The identities of Delta Force commanders are not generally public.",
      "\"The identity of the Delta Force commander is not classified, so this entire discussion is premised on Rep. Luna's misunderstanding of the military and the law,\" Harp told CBS News.",
      "Press freedom advocates defended Harp in\u00a0a letter to House leaders earlier this week. They said the subpoena \"poses a grave danger to the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.\"",
      "\"The public identities of public officials with command responsibility over controversial political or military decisions are a matter of public concern and are not (or cannot properly be) classified, especially with respect to a past operation,\" they said, adding that \"journalists have a right under the First Amendment to publish even classified information.\"",
      "GOP Reps. Richard Hudson and Pat Harrigan of North Carolina are introducing a companion bill in the House.",
      "\"The Special Operator Protection Act closes a clear gap in the law and makes one thing clear: if you recklessly expose our nation's heroes, there will be consequences,\" Hudson said in a statement.",
      "Hudson's district includes Fort Bragg, home to several special operations forces and the topic of Harp's book, The Fort Bragg Cartel.",
      "Harrigan, who was a member of the special forces, said the legislation \"closes a real hole in the law and makes sure our Special Operations Forces aren't left exposed after carrying out some of the most dangerous missions this country asks anyone to do.\"",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that journalist Seth Harp had said that every American involved in the Venezuela operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny,\" but in his post, he had written that every \"civilian official and military officer in the American chain of command\" involved in the operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny.\" The article has been updated.",

      "McDonald is considered a close ally to Blanche, one of the people familiar with the matter told CBS News. The fact that Mr. Trump is considering him for the role suggests that the White House is listening to Blanche's advice, the person added.",
      "Of all of the associate deputy attorneys general in Blanche's office, McDonald is among those with the most experience in the field as a prosecutor.",
      "He is also among a handful of close advisers in Blanche's office who has been involved in efforts to root out what Trump allies have described as the weaponization of the U.S. justice system against him during President Biden's tenure, according to government records reviewed by CBS News.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:30:20 -0500",
    "summary": "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" said GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno, who previously expected the compromise to be unveiled this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican senators said Thursday that a long-sought bipartisan compromise to extend the expired Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits for two years has stalled.",
      "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, blaming Democratic leaders for the lack of movement on the issue. \"So for me, I'm going to take a pause until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader and his leadership team that they are willing to contemplate a deal that extends these enhanced premium tax credits with the reforms that we've outlined.\"",
      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Moreno \"is trying to distract from the reality.\"",
      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",
      "\"The only path forward at this moment is for Senate Republicans to do the right thing by the American people and pass the damn bill that we sent over to you,\" he told reporters at a news conference.",
      "Alan  He and \n                                                  \n                      Seiji  Yamashita\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump is threatening to invoke a centuries-old law to deploy troops to Minnesota. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he might invoke a centuries-old law known as the Insurrection Act to send troops into Minnesota, threatening a major escalation between the federal government and state officials.",
      "\"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat comes amid protests over the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and increased tensions over immigration operations in the Twin Cities. The administration has sent thousands of federal law enforcement agents to the state in recent weeks to investigate fraud and implement the latest phase of its immigration crackdown.",
      "The invocation of the Insurrection Act could clear the way for the Trump administration to deploy troops to the state over the objections of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and local officials. Here's what to know about the law:",
      "What is the Insurrection Act?",
      "The Insurrection Act has its roots in the 1790s and evolved over the decades, with the last substantive amendment coming in 1874. The law as written gives the president broad authority to deploy troops and enlist state militias to address unrest on U.S. soil, largely at his own discretion.",
      "The statute has three main sections:",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.\u00a0The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"\u00a0The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.",
      "The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"",
      "The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "\"The basic idea, which emerged early on in the United States, is that there might be circumstances when state and local law enforcement resources and state and local militia, now the National Guard, would not be able to adequately contain protests or disturbances on the ground in their communities,\" said William Banks, a professor emeritus at Syracuse University and expert on the domestic role of the military. \"So the Insurrection Act allows the president to call forth the regular military or other federal forces to come into state or local communities and engage in law enforcement in an emergency circumstance.\"",
      "When can the Insurrection Act be used?",
      "The law leaves it up to the president to determine when it should be invoked.",
      "Joseph Nunn, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who has studied the statute extensively, said the act has historically been a \"tool for emergency situations when civilian authorities are overwhelmed by some sudden crisis \u2014 an insurrection, mass civil unrest.\"",
      "The law gives the president wide latitude to determine when an insurrection exists and how long troops can be used to address it. But \"broad discretion is not the same thing as infinite discretion, and broad discretion can be abused,\" Nunn said.",
      "\"The Insurrection Act was written to apply when all hell breaks loose. And when all hell breaks loose, of course, is in the eye of the beholder,\" Banks said. He noted that the basis for triggering the act \"is incredibly open-ended\" and the statute \"basically says the president can do this whenever he determines that it's impractical to enforce the laws.\"",
      "\"There are no procedural requirements, like a consultation with state and local officials, reports to Congress, sunsets \u2014 you know, do it for 30 days or 60 days, but then you've got to get out unless Congress renews it by statute, something like that,\" Banks said. \"It's just open-ended. The president does it. He does it on his own say so, and he doesn't have any particular criteria to follow.\"",
      "An 1878 law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the military for law enforcement purposes. But the Insurrection Act is the law's \"most important exception,\" said Nunn, and its invocation means the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply.",
      "When has the Insurrection Act been invoked?",
      "The Insurrection Act and its predecessor have been used to address 30 crises over the years, according to a tally by the Brennan Center. It was invoked most recently in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush ordered troops deployed to California to suppress the L.A. riots at the request of the state's governor.",
      "The law has typically been invoked when states request assistance from the federal government. Presidents have invoked the act unilaterally only five times in the past 130 years, all during the Civil Rights Era, according to Nunn.",
      "In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and sent in the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to enforce desegregation. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act three times over the objections of state officials, once in Mississippi and twice in Alabama. Johnson also used the law unilaterally in Alabama in 1965.",
      "\"The idea is that it should rarely, if ever, be invoked, and indeed, in our history, it hasn't been utilized very often,\" Banks said.",
      "Has Trump used the Insurrection Act before?",
      "No, but he has threatened to.",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump entertained the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to cities across the U.S. in response to widespread racial unrest following the killing of George Floyd.",
      "\"If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" he said in a speech at the White House in June 2020. He ultimately decided against doing so, with reports at the time indicating that administration officials were split over deploying troops.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the use of the act since returning to the White House last year. In October, he told reporters that \"if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the law.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because \u2026 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "Hasn't Trump sent troops into other cities?",
      "Yes, but he hasn't used the Insurrection Act to do so, and a recent Supreme Court decision limited his ability to send in troops under a separate authority.",
      "Last year, Mr. Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to cities in California, Illinois, Tennessee and Oregon, as well as Washington, D.C., under an authority known as Title 10, the portion of the federal code that deals with the armed forces. The administration argued the troops were needed to support immigration agents and protect federal property.",
      "Several cities and states where officials objected to the troops being deployed filed lawsuits seeking to block them. In one case, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sought an order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization and deployment of the Illinois National Guard was illegal. A district judge agreed and blocked the administration's plans.",
      "The dispute made its way to the Supreme Court. In December, the justices declined to freeze the lower court order in a narrow, preliminary 6-3 decision. A week later, Mr. Trump said the National Guard was leaving Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.",
      "\"I think the Supreme Court ruling certainly makes it more likely that they will try to use the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn said, while noting that the justices did not decide the case on the merits.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota?",
      "The president said in his Truth Social post that he might invoke the law to protect the 3,000 ICE agents and other federal officers who have been sent to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of the administration's immigration crackdown and fraud investigations.",
      "The administration has targeted Minnesota on a number of fronts in recent weeks amid renewed scrutiny over massive fraud schemes that have been uncovered in the state over the past several years. The president and other administration officials have pinned the blame for the scandal on Walz, the governor and Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024. The increased immigration operations in Minnesota are taking place alongside a surge in federal resources aimed at investigating fraud.",
      "Local officials have said the federal agents are responsible for inflaming tensions on the ground, pointing to the heavy-handed tactics of ICE agents and the deadly shooting of Good last week. Administration officials have said the agent was acting in self-defense and that protesters and activists are obstructing federal law enforcement.",
      "Invoking the Insurrection Act would let the president deploy National Guard or active-duty troops to Minnesota to protect immigration agents and federal buildings. Using the act would, in theory, place the deployments on firmer legal ground than previous deployments.",
      "But Nunn, the Brennan Center scholar, said the events in Minnesota do not warrant invoking the act.",
      "\"Basically, it exists for a kind of narrow set of crisis situations, and none of the criteria that would justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act are present in Minnesota,\" Nunn said. \"What exactly is the insurrection? There is no insurrection. Are the insurrectionists the people of Minneapolis? Who exactly is being protected?\"",
      "Nunn said that it's \"hard to say how much unrest there actually is.\"",
      "\"But to the extent that there is any, it's largely being fomented by the lawlessness and violence of ICE and [Customs and Border Protection]. And to the extent that there is violence, it is primarily being perpetrated by ICE and CBP,\" he said. \"And the government can't go to an American city and foment unrest through lawless, violent conduct and then turn around and invoke the Insurrection Act, claiming that they need to do this to suppress that unrest.\"",
      "Could a court block Trump's invocation of the Insurrection Act?",
      "Yes, but a legal fight would take place in largely uncharted territory, according to Nunn. A president's invocation of the Insurrection Act has never been blocked by a court.",
      "\"There's very little case law on this subject,\" Nunn said. \"One, the Insurrection Act simply isn't invoked very often. It's a tool that's used very rarely. Two, it has never been flagrantly abused in this way. There have been invocations of the Insurrection Act that I would say weren't perfectly justified, weren't obviously necessary, but it has never been outright abused.\"",
      "Nunn said that \"no state has ever challenged an invocation of the Insurrection Act and there's only ever been one case where anyone\" has, a Supreme Court case known as Martin v. Mott in 1827. That decision found that the president has broad emergency powers, but Nunn said the particulars of the case mean it might not \"reflect a general rule.\"",
      "\"The available judicial precedent, which is very limited, suggests that there's a fairly narrow set of circumstances where using the Insurrection Act is appropriate,\" Nunn said. \"Your argument would almost certainly be that the president has exceeded the scope of his discretion with the statute, that he's using it for a situation that Congress did not intend to authorize.\"",
      "If a legal challenge made its way to the Supreme Court, Nunn said the justices' Title 10 ruling might give a hint of how they would decide.",
      "\"One of the messages that should be taken from the Supreme Court's ruling in December is that at least six justices are uncomfortable with the way that the Trump administration has been using the military domestically, and were uncomfortable with those deployments, which makes sense, because the Trump administration has been seeking to insert the military into civilian law enforcement on a scale that has no precedent in modern American history, and that runs afoul of the law in a variety of ways,\" he said. \"So it makes sense that the justices, the Supreme Court, would be uncomfortable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. and Taiwan have agreed to a deal that would lower tariffs on goods from Taiwan to no more than 15%, and boost Taiwanese semiconductor companies' financing for U.S. operations by half a trillion dollars, the Trump administration announced Thursday.",
      "The 15% would be a slightly lower rate than the 20% rate imposed under President Trump's so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for most imports from Taiwan. The Department of Commerce announced the agreement Thursday, saying Taiwanese semiconductor and tech companies will make new investments totaling at least $250 billion to promote energy, AI and innovation in the U.S., and Taiwan will offer credit guarantees of at least $250 billion to expand the chip supply chain in the U.S. The Trump administration sees semiconductor chips as a critical component to future innovation, and to competing with China.",
      "The Commerce Department, led by Secretary Howard Lutnick, didn't say which companies are expected to invest in the U.S. But Taiwan produces the majority of the world's semiconductor chips \u2014 and the most advanced chips. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is easily the largest semiconductor producer in the world, dwarfing its competitors.",
      "Taiwanese companies investing in new chip manufacturing in the U.S. will be able to avoid tariffs on some imports. The U.S. won't apply tariffs for generic pharmaceuticals, aircraft components and unavailable natural resources, the Commerce Department says.",
      "The deal was announced ahead of the Supreme Court's highly anticipated decision on whether the president can unilaterally levy tariffs on countries' imports.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The ICE agent involved in the fatal shooting could try to invoke immunity under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause to try to end state criminal prosecution.",
    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week sets up a potential legal showdown between the state and federal government.",
      "If the state were to indict the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on criminal charges, he could try to claim a form of immunity conferred by the Constitution. Vice President JD Vance raised this the day after the shooting, asserting that the officer was immune from prosecution because he's a federal agent.",
      "\"That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job,\" Vance said. The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Good weaponized her vehicle, and said the officer acted in self-defense. However, local officials pointed to video of the shooting and raised doubts.",
      "The FBI and Justice Department are leading the investigation into the shooting after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension withdrew from the federal probe, saying it didn't have \"complete access\" to the case evidence.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Minnesota officials \"don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "But Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law, told CBS News it's \"simply false\" that the state lacks jurisdiction.",
      "Shapiro, who previously served as Illinois' solicitor general, said Minnesota has the authority to investigate and prosecute crimes committed in the state.",
      "But any attempt to bring state criminal charges over Good's death is likely to face legal obstacles arising from a claim of immunity under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.",
      "What is Supremacy Clause immunity?",
      "The Supremacy Clause, in Article VI of the Constitution, establishes federal law as supreme, superseding state law. It limits the ability of states to interfere with federal law through criminal prosecution. States may hold federal officials accountable for violating state law, unless state law conflicts with federal law; if there is a conflict, federal law prevails. But if state prosecutors have evidence federal officials acted in ways not related to their job duties or work policies, then state law prevails.",
      "Federal officials may be prosecuted if they \"acted beyond the scope of their duties, violated federal law, or behaved in an egregious or unwarranted manner,\" Bryna Godar, an attorney at the State Democracy Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin Law School, wrote in a brief explainer.",
      "The state is independently gathering its own evidence in the Good case. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty's office has set up an evidence portal that has received a \"substantial\" number of submissions, she said in an interview Monday with CBS Minnesota.",
      "Moriarty also said after the FBI took over sole authority of the investigation that her office has jurisdiction to review evidence and make a decision about charges because the shooting happened in Hennepin County.",
      "If a state prosecutor obtains an indictment or files criminal charges against a federal officer, the officer has the right to have any potential state charges in the case heard in federal court. It's at this point the officer might invoke immunity under the Supremacy Clause, says Robert McNamara, deputy litigation director for the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that litigates \"to end widespread abuse of government powers.\"",
      "How could the Supremacy Clause immunity be used?",
      "If charges were filed, Ross would likely appear before a federal judge and assert that he was invoking the doctrine, and that the actions he took in shooting Good were reasonable and necessary to fulfill his federal duties \u2014\u00a0 a separate question from whether the shooting constituted a crime.",
      "\"That's the doctrine that's going to be at the center of the fight,\" McNamara said.",
      "The federal government would not be a party in this fight. The immunity battle would be waged between the agent, in this case Ross, and the state of Minnesota,\u00a0 although the feds could provide support by hiring a defense attorney or filing an amicus brief.",
      "The court would have to answer two questions at that point, Seth W. Stoughton, a law professor at South Carolina School of Law, explained in an email to CBS News. First, was Ross acting within the scope of his duties, authorized by federal law?\u00a0 Second, was he performing his duties in a \"necessary and proper\" way?\"",
      "If the court determined the answer was \"yes\" to these questions, Ross could be granted immunity from the state prosecution, Stoughton said.",
      "The case could then be dismissed.",
      "If, however, the judge allowed the prosecution to proceed, it would remain in federal court with state laws applied.",
      "Federal courts \"have permitted state authorities to prosecute federal officers for using deadly force when they conclude that the force could have been unreasonable or excessive,\" Stoughon said.",
      "He cited a case from the early 1990s when an FBI sniper killed an unarmed woman during the standoff near Ruby Ridge. Idaho prosecutors charged the agent with involuntary manslaughter, and a federal court allowed it to proceed. (The case was later dropped by state prosecutors.)",
      "States have criminally prosecuted federal officials since the early 1880s, with mixed results. Experts say Supremacy Clause immunity is a complex legal process most often used during times of heightened tensions between the states and the federal government.",
      "If Ross was eventually convicted on state charges, he could not be pardoned by President Trump, Shapiro noted. The president has the power to pardon people only for federal offenses, not for state crimes.",

      "A large crowd quickly formed at the scene, with demonstrators clashing with law enforcement into the early morning hours.",
      "The shooting came exactly one week after\u00a0ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good\u00a0in south Minneapolis.",
      "Early Thursday morning, President Trump took to his Truth Social platform to say Operation Metro Surge will continue following the decision Wednesday by federal Judge Kate Menendez to deny Minnesota and Twin Cities prosecutors a temporary restraining order against ICE.",
      "\"A highly respected judge declined to block I.C.E. operations in the very politically corrupt State of Minnesota. I.C.E. will therefore be allowed to continue its highly successful operation of removing some of the most violent and vicious criminals anywhere in the World, many of them murderers, from the State. The great patriots of Law Enforcement will continue to make our Country safe. RECORD LOW CRIME NUMBERS!!!\" Trump wrote.",
      "Thursday morning, Mr. Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy troops to Minneapolis. He has repeatedly threatened to invoke the rarely used federal law to deploy the U.S. military or federalize the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, over the objections of state governors.",
      "Walz on social media on Thursday made a \"direct appeal\" to the president.",
      "\"Let's turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,\" Walz wrote.",
      "Walz's statement also included \"an appeal to Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"I know this is scary,\" he wrote. \"We can \u2014 we must \u2014 speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O'Hara held a joint news conference late Wednesday night in which Frey also called for peace. O'Hara said his officers were struck by rocks, fireworks, ice chunks and snowballs. The chief said protesters crossed the line, and mutual aid from the Minnesota State Patrol and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office was called in.",
      "\"This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further,\" O'Hara said. \"I have faith that the investigators who are involved will follow every lead in this case and ensure it is completed to its logical conclusion.\"",
      "Frey once again called for ICE to leave Minneapolis.",
      "\"There's still a lot that we don't know at this time, but what I can tell you for certain is that this is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in, and at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to maintain order,\" Frey said.",
      "The mayor noted the stark contrast between the number of Minneapolis police officers and the thousands of federal agents now in the area.",
      "\"We have approximately 600 police officers in Minneapolis ... and there are approximately 3,000 ICE agents in the area,\" Frey said. \"We have ICE agents throughout our city and throughout our state who, along with Border Patrol, are creating chaos. This is not the path we should be on in America.\"",
      "Frey then took to social media late Wednesday night, saying, \"We cannot respond to Donald Trump's chaos with our own chaos.\"",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced on social media overnight it is investigating the shooting, and that it will be an independent investigation. O'Hara said the FBI was also on the scene collecting evidence.",
      "WCCO has also heard reports of protesters breaking into federal vehicles at the scene, and have reached out to police for more information.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche released a statement Wednesday night accusing Walz and Frey of stoking the violence.",
      "\"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting,\" Blanche said. \"Walz and Frey \u2014 I'm focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It's a promise.\"",
      "Details of the shooting",
      "According to law enforcement officials briefed on the incident, the shooting occurred around 7 p.m. during a targeted ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) action near North Sixth Street and North 24th Avenue.",
      "Officials say one man armed with a shovel \u2014 described as an \"illegal alien\" from Venezuela and the primary target of the operation \u2014 assaulted an ICE officer, striking the officer with the shovel and attempting to hit the agent's head. An ICE ERO agent then opened fire, striking the man in the leg.",
      "After being shot, the man fled into a residence. Law enforcement officials say they later determined the house contained three additional targets. All four individuals barricaded themselves inside the home.",
      "Due to the barricade situation, additional agents were called to the scene, officials said. Officers breached the house with the assistance of an ICE specialized tactical team. Officials believe all individuals inside the home were taken into custody.",
      "Homeland Security officials said in a statement the Venezuelan national initially fled law enforcement in a vehicle but soon crashed into a parked car before fleeing on foot.",
      "DHS issued a statement Wednesday evening saying the officer was assaulted by the man as he resisted arrest, and while they were on the ground struggling, \"two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.\"",
      "\"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,\" DHS officials said.",
      "Less than a hour before the shooting, Walz gave a rare primetime address\u00a0in which he called on Mr. Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to \"end this occupation.\" The governor also called on Minnesotans to film the actions of federal agents for use in future prosecutions.",
      "Late Wednesday night, Walz said on social media, \"State investigators have been on the scene in North Minneapolis.   I know you're angry. I'm angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets.   But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace.   Don't give him what he wants.\"",

      "The outline released by the White House, however, is sparse on details. especially considering the president said as far back as his first term in office that he would be releasing a health care plan, giving him and his team years to develop a comprehensive proposal. The outline the White House released Thursday mentioned some of the things the administration has already been working on in recent months, like negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to lower individual drug prices.",
      "The White House says the proposal would \"execute the president's vision to send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums, and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "The president said part of his proposal, which would have to be passed by Congress, would have the federal government send money directly to Americans to buy their own health care.",
      "\"The government is going to pay the money directly to you. It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,\" the president said in a five-minute video the White House released. \"Nobody has ever heard of that before, and that's the way it is.\"",
      "The White House hasn't gone into detail about how the plan would work, although White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the money could go into health savings accounts.",
      "\"My plan would reduce your insurance premiums by stopping government payoffs to big insurance companies and sending that money directly to the people,\" the president also said. \"Obamacare was designed to make insurance companies rich.\"",

Mayor Brandon Johnson tells CBS News his administration is working to address that discrepancy, which he said is driven by homicides and drug overdoses.",
      "According to 2023 numbers\u00a0from the\u00a0Chicago Department of Public Health, life expectancy in the neighborhood known as the Loop was 87.3 years, the highest of any Chicago neighborhood.

    "summary": "A panel of judges on a federal appeals court ruled Thursday that a district court judge did not have the authority to order the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A panel of judges on a federal appeals court ruled Thursday that a district court judge did not have the authority to order the release of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University activist who has been targeted by the Trump administration for deportation.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled 2-1 that the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey \"lacked jurisdiction over Khalil's removal proceedings\" under a provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, or INA.",
      "\"Our holdings vindicate essential principles of habeas and immigration law. The scheme Congress enacted governing immigration proceedings provides Khalil a meaningful forum in which to raise his claims later on \u2014 in a petition for review of a final order of removal,\" the majority wrote.",
      "The decision is a victory for the Trump administration in its push to detain and remove pro-Palestinian activists in the U.S. on student visas. The judges ordered the district court to vacate Khalil's habeas corpus petition, raising the prospect that he could be detained again as his immigration case proceeds.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Khalil, said in a statement that the ruling \"does not go into effect immediately and the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Mr. Khalil until the order takes formal effect, which will not happen while he has the opportunity to seek immediate review.\" Khalil said the ruling is \"deeply disappointing, but it does not break our resolve.\"",
      "\"The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability,\" he said. \"I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.\"",
      "Khalil is a green card holder of Palestinian descent who was detained by immigration agents in March. He was initially detained under a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\" Khalil alleges the Trump administration detained him for months and sought to deport him as part of a wider policy of punishing foreign students for protesting Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas.",
      "Khalil's legal team filed a habeas petition with the U.S. District Court in New Jersey seeking his release. Judge Michael Farbiarz granted that request in June, determining that Khalil was not a threat to the community, was not a flight risk and that his detention had been \"highly unusual.\"",
      "While proceedings were underway in New Jersey, a separate immigration judge was considering the government's attempt to remove Khalil from the country. The immigration judge ultimately concluded that he could be deported to Algeria or Syria, which Khalil has challenged.",
      "The appeals panel ruled on Thursday that the district court had jurisdiction to hear Khalil's habeas petition, but it did not have \"subject-matter\" jurisdiction. The court said that the proper avenue for Khalil to challenge his detention and deportation was through the process laid out by the INA, not a habeas petition.",
      "\"[V]arious provisions of the INA limit an alien's ability to collaterally attack (challenge) ongoing immigration proceedings through habeas. The District Court did not see those limits as barring subject-matter jurisdiction over Khalil's claims. We disagree,\" the majority wrote. \"[The INA] strips the District Court of jurisdiction, requiring Khalil to wait to raise his claims until he files a petition for review (PFR) of a final order of removal.\"",
      "The two judges who ruled in the government's favor were Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas. Hardiman was named to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2007, and Bibas was appointed by President Trump in 2017.",
      "Judge Arianna Freeman, a Biden appointee, dissented from the majority's ruling, writing that she believes the district court does have subject-matter jurisdiction over Khalil's case.",

      "Thousands of federal grants supporting the programs were suddenly terminated late Tuesday before sources confirmed to CBS News that the decision was reversed.",
      "The abrupt cancellations at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration would have impacted 2,706 of the agency's discretionary grants, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

      "CBS News has reached out to SAMHSA for comment.",
      "\"After national outrage, Secretary Kennedy has bowed to public pressure and reinstated $2 billion in SAMHSA grants that save lives. These are cuts he should not have issued in the first place,\" the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut, said in a statement.",
      "The reason for the initial cuts wasn't immediately clear.",
      "CBS News obtained a termination notice sent by a top SAMHSA official saying the agency was \"terminating some of its awards in order to better prioritize agency resources\" toward priorities \"that address the rising rates of mental illness and substance abuse conditions, overdose, and suicide.\"",
      "\"This was not SAMSHA's idea,\" the CBS News source said, noting that many of the canceled grants addressed those priorities. \"This was money going to people on the ground who are providing mental health treatment, substance use treatment, recovery support, and prevention resources, which this administration says is a priority.\"",
      "SAMHSA, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, is at the forefront of efforts to improve mental health and address substance abuse across the country. At the national level, the agency leads public health initiatives geared toward reducing the burden of substance abuse and mental illness on communities, while also distributing funds to states and local entities for mental health and addiction services, according to its website.",
      "A source said that among the grants affected was one that provided $15 million per year to the Opioid Response Network, a program that offers evidence-based education and training to local authorities managing various types of substance use intervention, including prevention, treatment and recovery services. Another was a $6 million grant to a program called Building Communities of Recovery, which funds community-based resources to increase the availability and quality of long-term recovery support for people with substance use disorder.",

    "summary": "Years after the first reports of Havana Syndrome emerged, U.S. officials have obtained and are testing a device\u200b that could be linked to the debilitating condition.",
    "story": [
      "There's a new development in the yearslong international mystery over Havana Syndrome: The U.S. has obtained and has been testing a device that officials believe could be linked to the debilitating condition.",
      "Sources said the device was quietly obtained by the Department of Homeland Security in late 2024, almost a decade after symptoms of what became known as Havana Syndrome were first reported by U.S. embassy personnel in Cuba. The Pentagon has since been testing the portable, backpack-sized device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy and contains components of Russian origin.",
      "The sources said Homeland Security investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome. The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment, and the CIA declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the mysterious illness.",
      "\"My brain is broken\"",
      "The term Havana Syndrome is derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Cuba's capital. After the U.S. embassy opened there in 2015, media outlets started reporting on strange medical symptoms affecting U.S. embassy personnel working in the country: dizziness, fatigue, memory problems and impaired vision. Other symptom include nausea, migraines, head pressure, vertigo and ringing or popping sensations in the ears.",
      "Many people with Havana Syndrome describe hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location, with effects so severe for some that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs.",
      "\"My brain is broken,\" former CIA analyst Erika Stith told CBS News in 2022.",
      "\"We got this as a result of serving our country. And we deserve to be taken care of,\" she said.",
      "The U.S. government refers to the cases as \"anomalous health incidents,\" or AHIs, and officials have not confirmed what caused them.",
      "But \"60 Minutes\" has spoken with experts who believe the incidents involve targeted sonic or microwave attacks.",
      "Many of those affected believe that they were wounded by a secret weapon that fires a high-energy beam of microwaves or ultrasound.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting the government for failing to provide enough support or access to specialized medical care.",
      "Who has been affected?",
      "More than 1,500 U.S. officials have reported experiencing the condition since 2016, including White House staff, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers and their families. Cases have emerged in dozens of countries, and have even been reported in Washington, D.C.",
      "In 2021, a Havana Syndrome-style incident was reported in Vietnam shortly before then-Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0visited Hanoi. The U.S. embassy there said at the time that a \"possible anomalous health incident\" required at least one official to be evacuated for medical care, and it prompted Harris to delay her arrival.",
      "\"60 Minutes\" later learned that 11 people reported being stricken: two officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi and nine others who were part of a Defense Department team preparing for Harris' visit. While Harris was unharmed, some of the injured U.S. personnel were medevac'ed out of Vietnam.",
      "In another case, a State Department security officer who worked in the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, China, told \"60 Minutes\" that he and his wife started having symptoms after hearing bizarre sounds in their apartment in 2017.",
      "The security officer, Mark Lenzi, described the sound as a \"marble\" circling down a \"metal funnel\" and said he heard it four times \u2014 always in the same spot at the same time of day: above his son's crib when he put him to bed at night. He described the sound as \"fairly loud\" and like nothing he'd heard before. He and his wife began to feel ill shortly after hearing the sounds.",
      "Lenzi said he believed he was targeted due to his work using top-secret equipment to analyze electronic threats to diplomatic missions.",
      "\"This was a directed standoff attack against my apartment\u2026it was a weapon,\" he told correspondent Scott Pelley. \"I believe it's RF, radio frequency energy, in the microwave range.\"",
      "Questions about Russia's possible role",
      "\"60 Minutes\" reported in mid-2024 on a major development in the Havana Syndrome investigation: a suspected link between attacks in Tbilisi, Georgia, and a top-secret Russian intelligence unit, as well as evidence that a reliable source called \"a receipt\" for acoustic weapons testing done by the same intelligence unit.",
      "Lt. Col. Greg Edgreen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who led the Pentagon investigation into these incidents, told \"60 Minutes\" at the time that he was confident that Russia was behind these attacks, and that they were part of a worldwide campaign to neutralize U.S. officials.",

      "U.S. assessments",
      "A U.S. intelligence assessment released in 2023 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses \u2014 a conclusion reaffirmed in an updated review released a year ago. That review found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable.",
      "Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "In 2024, the House Intelligence Committee concluded in a report that the 2023 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"lacked analytic integrity and was highly irregular in its formulation.\" The report said it \"appears increasingly likely that a foreign adversary is behind some cases of what officials refer to as \"anomalous health incidents.\"",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence says it has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents and \"remains committed to sharing findings\" with the American public when it's complete.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos said that \"a new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one.\"",
      "Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after he said he was stricken in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:02:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard two cases involving laws from Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to uphold state laws that\u00a0ban transgender athletes\u00a0from participating in girls' and women's sports, wading for the first time into the contentious issue.",
      "The justices heard more than three hours of arguments in a pair of cases challenging laws from West Virginia and Idaho that require public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated based on biological sex at birth and restrict transgender girls and women from competing on teams that correspond with their gender identity.",
      "Across the arguments, the justices debated the level of scientific evidence behind whether transgender athletes who have received gender-transition treatments hold any athletic advantage over female competitors, as well as whether the laws discriminate based on sex and transgender status, as two transgender athletes who challenged their states' measures argue.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court could have ramifications for more than half the country: Idaho and West Virginia are among the 27 states that have enacted laws in recent years that forbid participation by transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The two transgender athletes who brought the cases, Lindsay Hecox of Idaho and Becky Pepper-Jackson of West Virginia, filed lawsuits challenging the laws in their respective states several years ago, arguing that they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark law that prohibits sex discrimination in education programs. The bans, the athletes said, categorically exclude all transgender girls and women from school sports altogether, and treat them worse than their peers. Lower courts ruled in favor of Hecox and Pepper-Jackson.",
      "But Idaho and West Virginia officials asserted that their bans do not discriminate based on transgender status and draw permissible distinctions between the sexes. They said that the laws' sex-based classifications are allowed because they are substantially related to their interest in fair and safe athletic opportunities for women and girls.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the growth of girls' and women's sports since Title IX was enacted 50 years ago is one of the \"successes in America,\" and he warned that allowing transgender athletes to compete on girls' and women's sports teams threatened to \"undermine or reverse\" that success. He said sports are typically a \"zero-sum game,\" and transgender athletes can displace girls and women if they are selected for a team or take their place on a podium.",
      "\"For the individual girl who does not make the team or doesn't get on the stand for the medal or doesn't make all-league, there's a harm there, and I think we can't sweep that aside,\" Kavanaugh said. He later sought to clarify that a ruling from the Supreme Court on Title IX grounds would be specific to sports and unlikely to open the door to policies that separate males and females in the classroom or other activities.",
      "Kavanaugh also said that when Congress enacted Title IX decades ago, it understood \"sex\" to mean biological sex at birth, and it would be up to lawmakers today to adjust the definition in the law.",
      "Some of the justices sought to test the lines of when it would be permissible under Title IX for girls and boys to be treated differently. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed the hypothetical scenario of boys having separate high school remedial programs, while Justices Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett raised examples of proficiency in chess or calculus.",
      "Barrett and Justice Clarence Thomas also questioned whether boys who are less athletically skilled than their male peers could try out for girls' teams if the laws were wiped away.",
      "But some of the liberal justices said that Pepper-Jackson and Hecox, as well as other transgender athletes like them, are seeking an exception to the state bans. Lawyers for the athletes told the court they received medical interventions that do not give them an unfair edge over girls and women competing against them.",
      "\"I would think the state would just have to make exceptions where people can demonstrate that the justification that makes the state's conduct constitutional doesn't apply to them,\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.",
      "Joshua Block, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued on behalf of Pepper-Jackson, told the justices that she and Hecox are categorically excluded from all sports, and said some states are using the definition of \"sex\" to deny athletic opportunity. He urged the Supreme Court not to issue a broad ruling, but to instead allow the district court to evaluate the facts and evidence related to athletic advantage.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",
      "Little v. Hecox",
      "Idaho was the first state in the nation to enact a law barring transgender athletes from competing on girls' and women's athletic teams. Called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the measure requires public school and collegiate sports teams to be designated \"based on biological sex.\" Under the law, athletic teams designated for females, women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\"",
      "If a student's sex is disputed, the law requires the athlete to provide a health examination and consent form that verifies their biological sex at birth.",
      "Hecox, a transgender woman who wanted to compete on the women's track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, filed a lawsuit challenging Idaho's law and argued it is unconstitutional and a violation of Title IX. Hecox, who takes hormone therapy, tried out for the university's track and cross-country teams but did not make them. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running.",
      "Idaho's attorney general and two athletes, Madison Kenyon and Mary Kate Marshall, are defending the law. Kenyon and Marshall competed on the women's track and cross-country teams at Idaho State University and placed behind a transgender student-athlete in various events in 2019 and early 2020.",
      "\"If women don't have their own competitions, they won't be able to compete,\" Alan Hurst, Idaho's solicitor general, told the high court. \"Gender identity does not matter in sports, and that's why Idaho's law does not classify on the basis of gender identity. It treats all males equally and all females equally, regardless of identity.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Kenyon and Marshall explained why they were defending the law.",
      "\"I know it's not fair, because I stepped on the line and was beat by a male, and saw hundreds of other women be beat by a male,\" Kenyon told CBS News.",
      "\"I mean, to wake up at 7 a.m. every single day, putting in workouts, running, going to the gym, and then, to go to the race, already knowing the outcome, it's absolutely deflating,\" Marshall said.",
      "U.S. District Judge David C. Nye ruled in favor of Hecox in 2020, and blocked enforcement of the ban, finding that it \"discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed that decision and concluded that Idaho's ban is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed in July to take up the challenge to the Idaho and West Virginia laws. But since then, Hecox, now 25, has sought to have the case dismissed as moot. She decided to refrain from playing any women's sports at Boise State University or in Idaho, and would not participate in any school-sponsored athletics covered by Idaho's ban.",
      "West Virginia v. B.P.J.",
      "West Virginia lawmakers enacted its ban, called the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021. Like Idaho's measure, the law requires athletic teams to be designated \"based on biological sex.\" The law states that athletic teams or sports designated for females \"shall not be open to students of the male sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport.\"",
      "Before the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson wanted to compete on the girls' cross-country and track teams, and sued to block enforcement of the ban against her, arguing it violated Title IX and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old transgender girl, began socially transitioning in third grade and has taken puberty-delaying medication and hormone therapy. She is now a sophomore in high school.",
      "In 2023, a U.S. district court upheld the law on both equal protection and Title IX grounds, finding West Virginia's classification based on biological sex is substantially related to its interest in providing equal athletic opportunities for females.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court blocked West Virginia officials from enforcing the ban against Pepper-Jackson while proceedings continued, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas in dissent. The 4th Circuit then divided 2-1 in finding that the law violates Title IX because it discriminates based on gender identity, which it said is discrimination on the basis of sex.",
      "The debate over transgender athletes",
      "It's unclear how many transgender athletes are covered by bans in the 27 states that restrict participation in girls' and women's sports. The Williams Institute at UCLA Law School estimates that up to 122,000 transgender athletes could be participating in high school athletics.",
      "Pepper-Jackson is the only openly transgender student-athlete in West Virginia, her lawyers say, and they argue that neither she nor Hecox have any athletic advantage over their female competitors because they've received gender-transition treatments.",
      "But West Virginia officials argue that as a result of Pepper-Jackson's participation in girls' sports, she displaced at least 400 female athletes in standings in track-and-field events in the spring 2025 season.",
      "West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams and state officials warned that the 4th Circuit's decision requires states to treat sex and gender identity as synonymous when it comes to sports.",
      "\"Maintaining separate boys and girls sports teams ensures that girls can safely and fairly compete in school sports. The question today is whether this enduring structure can continue,\" Williams told the justices. \"It can. Title IX permits sex-separated teams. It does so because biological sex matters in athletics in ways both obvious and undeniable.\"",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Idaho officials assert that sex is biological and immutable, and causes the differences between males and females. They say their law is motivated by those physical and physiological differences, and classify based on sex to account for those distinctions.",
      "The Trump administration is backing West Virginia and Idaho in the cases. In a friend-of-the-court brief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the practice of sex-separated sports is justified for transgender athletes, because physiological differences between males and females are unrelated to gender identity and not eliminated by medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "\"In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else,\" Sauer wrote. \"That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination.\"",
      "On the other side, Hecox's lawyers first argue her case should be dismissed because she has stopped playing any sports covered by the ban. But the legal teams for both transgender athletes also refute that Idaho and West Virginia's laws are substantially related to their interests in promoting equality and safety in female athletics.",
      "\"The statutory text, history, and purpose lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Act intentionally treats transgender women and girls differently \u2014 and worse \u2014 by categorically barring them from playing women's and girls' sports,\" Hecox's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "In Pepper-Jackson's challenge to West Virginia's law, her legal team says in court papers that Title IX does not authorize the \"wholesale exclusion\" of transgender girls from athletics. They argue the state's restriction subjects Pepper-Jackson to discrimination because it denies her equal access to athletics.",
      "The legal battles over the state bans for transgender athletes are the latest involving LGBTQ rights to land before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2020, the court divided 6-3 in finding that protections from workplace discrimination under Title VII extend to transgender and gay employees, with Justice Neil Gorsuch authoring the majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts joined Gorsuch and the three liberal justices in the majority, though he suggested when debating the sports-participation bans that the reasoning in that earlier case may not extend to these legal battles.",
      "\"The question here is whether or not a sex-based classification is necessarily a transgender classification,\" he said.",
      "In its last term, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law barring medical interventions for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The high court found that the law does not rely on sex-based classifications, but instead draws lines based on medical use and age.",
      "The Supreme Court has also allowed Mr. Trump to temporarily enforce policies banning transgender people from serving in the military and requiring passports to reflect the holder's biological sex at birth. Both cases landed before the high court in their early stages, and the Supreme Court has not yet been asked to decide the legal merits.",

    "summary": "Two Republicans switched their votes after pressure from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans killed a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to further strike Venezuela after the White House put pressure on a handful of GOP senators who supported it.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana flipped their support Wednesday after initially voting to advance it. Vice President JD Vance had to step in to break the 50-50 tie.",
      "Republicans used a procedural maneuver to block the measure, arguing that the resolution should no longer be \"privileged\" \u2014 which gives it priority on the floor \u2014 because the U.S. is not currently engaged in \"hostilities\" with Venezuela.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, previewed the argument in floor remarks Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Today, we expect a vote on a resolution to direct the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities in or against Venezuela, even though the U.S. is not currently engaged in hostilities in or against Venezuela,\" Thune said. \"We have no troops on the ground in Venezuela. We're not currently conducting military operations there.\"",
      "Senators\u00a0advanced\u00a0the resolution, introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, last week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife and Mr. Trump asserted the U.S. is now in charge of the country.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure, pushing it forward after two previous failed attempts in the upper chamber to advance similar resolutions to rein in Mr. Trump's military action in the region.",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Hawley, Young, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Murkowski, Collins and Paul voted against the GOP effort to kill the resolution Wednesday.",
      "Kaine said Wednesday night he was disappointed in the outcome but saw it \"as a growing set of cracks\" in the GOP's willingness to stick with Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump quickly lashed out\u00a0at the Republicans, saying they \"should never be elected to office again.\" He again criticized the senators on Tuesday during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, calling them \"real losers.\"",
      "Some of the senators said they received calls from Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of Wednesday's action.",
      "Hawley said Rubio had addressed his concerns about U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "He said Rubio confirmed the U.S. \"has no ground troops currently in Venezuela\" and that if the administration plans to put troops in Venezuela, \"they would abide by the War Powers Act and they would come to Congress for congressional authorization.\"",
      "\"The secretary told me directly that the administration will not put ground troops in Venezuela,\" Hawley said.",
      "Young pushed back on criticism that he caved to pressure from the president, telling reporters that senators had \"secured some valuable reassurances and deliverables\" from the White House on Venezuela.",
      "\"I think we played our hand well,\" Young said, contending that the resolution was heading for a presidential veto if it eventually did make it through both chambers. Both the House and Senate would have needed a two-thirds majority to overcome a veto, which was unlikely.",
      "The switch-up appeared to come as a surprise to Kaine, who said Wednesday morning that he expected all five Republicans to stick with Democrats.",
      "Before Maduro's ouster, lawmakers said they had received insufficient answers from the Trump administration about whether its end goals in Venezuela included regime change, as the U.S. ramped up strikes\u00a0against alleged drug-smuggling boats, imposed an oil blockade and Mr. Trump threatened land strikes.",
      "Republicans who voted last week to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "A day after the initial Senate vote, Mr. Trump announced he had called off a \"second wave\" of attacks against Venezuela, claiming the two countries \"are working well together.\" But, he said, U.S. naval forces in the region would \"stay in place for safety and security purposes.\"",
      "Kaine attributed\u00a0Mr. Trump's decision to cancel more strikes to the war powers vote. CBS News did not receive a response from the White House regarding Kaine's assertion.",

      "The Trump administration announced Wednesday it will stop giving out visas to nationals of dozens of countries who are seeking to move to the U.S. permanently, escalating its broad crackdown on legal immigration.",
      "The State Department, which oversees visa processing at U.S. embassies and consulates, said it would indefinitely pause the issuance of immigrant visas requested by citizens of 75 countries, halting legal immigration channels for roughly 38% of all nations in the world.",
      "Officials said the pause would apply to immigrant visas, meaning those requested by people abroad who have been sponsored by American relatives or employers to move to the U.S. permanently. The suspension, officials said, does not affect temporary visas requested by would-be tourists and travelers seeking to come to the U.S. on a short-term basis.",
      "The State Department said the 75 countries were chosen as part of an effort to bar the entry of immigrants who were likely to rely on public assistance once in the U.S. Officials said they would examine immigration procedures during the pause to better identify and bar would-be immigrants from those countries who were likely to become a \"public charge\" \u2014 or an economic burden \u2014 on the U.S.",

      "The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500 million, has been completed, according to an administration official.",
      "The details of the sale haven't yet been disclosed, although the official said more sales are expected in the coming days and weeks. President Trump has said the U.S. will sell 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, in partnership with U.S. companies.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that President Trump had \"brokered a historic energy deal with Venezuela\" after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's arrest \"that will benefit the American and Venezuelan people.\" She said Mr. Trump's team is facilitating discussions with oil companies \"that are ready and willing to make unprecedented investments to restore Venezuela's oil infrastructure.\"",
      "The president\u00a0met with a number of top U.S. oil executives at the White House last week to discuss their needs and concerns. At that gathering, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told the president that his company had its assets seized under two previous waves of nationalization in Venezuela, and reentering a third time \"would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here and what is currently the state.\" He called the country \"uninvestable\" until changes are made to the country's legal system and commercial structure.",
      "The White House has presented a strategy to sell millions of barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil and control the proceeds, relying on investments from American oil companies to revive the country's oil infrastructure. Proceeds from the sale are to be split among Venezuelans, U.S. companies and the U.S. government, at the discretion of the federal government, the White House has said. The president has said all proceeds going to Venezuela would be used to purchase only American-made products.",

      "\"This is an important development to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "The Gaza native served as a deputy minister for transportation with the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. Shaath, an engineer, is an expert in economic development and reconstruction, according to his biography on the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute's website.",

      "Descending under four large parachutes, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov landed in the Pacific off San Diego at 3:41 a.m. EST, closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "\"On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew 11,\" a SpaceX flight controller radioed.",
      "\"It's so good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams that got us there and back,\" Cardman replied.",
      "SpaceX support crews stationed near the landing site quickly reached the gently bobbing spacecraft and hauled it aboard a company recovery ship where flight surgeons were standing by to carry out initial medical checks.",
      "Under strict medical privacy guidelines, NASA has not identified the astronaut who had the medical issue in orbit or provided any details about its nature.",
      "But the crew appeared healthy and in good spirts as they were helped out of the cramped capsule and onto waiting stretchers -- normal procedure for returning station crews -- smiling and waving as they began re-adjusting to gravity after five-and-a-half months in weightlessness.",
      "\"All crew members are currently undergoing the routine post-splashdown medical evaluation,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a post-landing news conference. \"The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so.\"",
      "All four were expected to be flown to shore by helicopter for more extensive diagnostic evaluation at an unidentified area hospital.",

      "\"Following a planned overnight hospital stay, the crew will return to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will reunite with their families and undergo standard post-flight reconditioning and evaluations.\"",
      "Left behind in orbit were Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who took over command of the space station from Fincke, and the cosmonaut's two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched last November for a planned eight-month stay in space.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space on Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "But last Wednesday, the day before a planned spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke, one of the crew members experienced a medical issue of some sort and the next day, NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape, but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "None of the crew members mentioned the issue in the week between their initial request for a private medical conference and their return to Earth. In a final post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of Mount Fuji, saying \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven: Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flyer gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",

      "But Fincke's LinkedIn post and a photo of Crew 11 checking out their pressure suits indicated the problem, whatever it might be, was not debilitating in any way.",
      "\"This was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists,\" Fincke wrote.",
      "The photo, Fincke added, \"was taken as we prepared our space suits for return - a normal, methodical step in getting ready to come home, and a reminder that this decision was made calmly and carefully, with people at the center.\"",
      "Crew 11's early return marks the first time in NASA history that a crew has been told to cut its mission short because of a medical issue.",
      "James Polk, NASA's chief medical officer, said Friday that according to statistical analyses, \"we should have had a medical evacuation approximately every three years ... and we've not one to date.\"",
      "\"Even in this case, we're erring on the side of caution,\" he said. \"Again, it's not an emergent evacuation, but we are erring on the side of caution for the crew member and in their best interest.\"",
      "Fincke plans to turn over command of the station to cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov during a brief ceremony Monday afternoon.",
      "\"What stands out most to me is how clearly NASA cares about its people,\" Fincke wrote. \"Flight surgeons, engineers, managers and support teams came together quickly and professionally to chart the best path forward.",
      "\"The ground teams - across mission control centers and partner organizations around the world - have been extraordinary. We're proud of the joint work we've done and the camaraderie we've shared, including some great songs and more than a few dad jokes.\"",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Kud-Sverchkov and his Soyuz MS-28 crewmates \u2014 Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams \u2014 will have the station to themselves until Crew 11's replacements arrive.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev remain officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. But NASA is working to move that target up a few days if possible.",
      "\"We're leaving the ISS in great hands,\" Fincke said. \"The three crewmates who arrived in November will continue the mission, and they'll be joined by Crew-12 in just a few weeks.\"",

      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",

      "\"The worst for me was seeing myself undressed, bent over and then my toddler's backpack in the background,\" the 27-year-old said. \"Because I had to then see that, and see myself violated in that way in such horrific images and then put that same backpack on my son the next day, because it's the one he wears every day to school.\"",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon will start using Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok. The word comes days after Grok drew global outcry for generating highly sexualized deepfake images.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\"Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\" Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 the chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI,  which is embedded into X, the social media network Musk owns \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Scrutiny has also been increasing in the European Union, India and France.",
      "Malaysian regulators said Tuesday they would take legal action against X and xAI over user safety concerns sparked by Grok but didn't say what form the proceedings would take, reports French news agency AFP.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \"make all appropriate data\" from the military's IT systems available for \"AI exploitation.\" He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \"We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\"",
      "He noted that the Pentagon possesses \"combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\"",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \"that won't allow you to fight wars.\"",
      "Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \"without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\" before adding that the Pentagon's \"AI will not be woke.\"",
      "Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \"woke AI\" interactions from rival chatbots like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.",

    "summary": "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as its new president and vice chairman.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.",
      "Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors \u2014 where, the company notes, she was \"deeply engaged\" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a \"great choice\" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and noted that Powell McCormick had \"served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.\"",
      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",
      "Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Mr. Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush.",
      "She is married to Sen. David McCormick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush, before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.",
      "And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions \u2014 including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.",
      "According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.",
      "The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Mr. Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Mr. Trump's orbit.",

    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

    "summary": "Another allegation against Busfield was reported to law enforcement the same day he turned himself in, according to a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield made his first court appearance on Wednesday, a day after turning himself in to authorities to face charges of child sex abuse stemming from allegations that he inappropriately touched a minor on the set of a TV series he was directing in New Mexico.",
      "Busfield was ordered held without bond. He appeared remotely via a video link from jail. Whether he remains in jail will be the subject of a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "Albuquerque police\u00a0issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which was filmed in Albuquerque.",
      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",
      "During Wednesday's brief court appearance, Busfield stood silent and expressionless, dressed in orange prison clothes, while a defense attorney spoke on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the court document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",

Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Machado previously said she wanted to \"share\" the prize for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado presented President Trump with her real Nobel Peace Prize medallion during her visit to the White House on Thursday, two White House officials told CBS News, and later at the Capitol, Machado confirmed she had done so.",
      "The medallion, which was not a replica, the sources said, was presented after Machado offered to share her Nobel Prize with him for what she said was his \"historic\" action of removing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed that Machado gave him the medal in a Truth Social post, calling it a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" He called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much.\"",
      "The White House late Thursday night posted a photo of Mr. Trump and Machado posing with the Nobel.",
      "The medallion was placed inside a gilded frame that read, \"In Gratitude for Your Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.\"",
      "Below the medallion was a certificate that stated: \"Presented as a Personal Symbol of Gratitude on behalf of the Venezuelan People in Recognition of President Trump's Principled and Decisive Action to Secure a Free Venezuela. The Courage of America, and its President Donald J. Trump, will Never be Forgotten by the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "The certificate was signed by Machado.",
      "Machado told senators on Capitol Hill she had an \"extraordinary\" meeting with Mr. Trump, according to a\u00a0post\u00a0from her spokesperson's office translated into English.",
      "Machado told reporters on Capitol Hill that she had presented Mr. Trump with the medal, and she suggested that in doing so, she was completing a kind of reciprocal gesture.",
      "She said she told him, \"Two hundred years ago, General Lafayette gave Simon Bolivar a medal with George Washington's face [on] it. Bolivar...kept that medal for the rest of his life.\" She added, \"When you see his portraits, you can see the medal there, and it was given by General Lafayette as a sign of the brotherhood between the United States, people of United States, and the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom against tyranny.\" Now, 200 years later, \"the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal \u2014 in this case, a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 as a recognition of his unique commitment with our freedom.\"",
      "Machado had floated the possibility of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump earlier this month. The president has not divulged details of their conversation.",
      "\"I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe \u2014 the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people \u2014 certainly want to, to give it to him and share it with him,\" Machado told Fox News host\u00a0Sean Hannity. \"What he has done is historic. It's a huge step towards a democratic transition.\"",
      "After Machado's offer to share the prize with the president, Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes clarified it cannot be shared or transferred. The Nobel Peace Center also said Thursday, \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"",
      "Machado was awarded the prize for being a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided \u2014 an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free elections and representative government.\"",
      "The Trump administration has said little about a democratic transition in Venezuela. The country's interim president is Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was Maduro's vice president. Mr. Trump spoke Wednesday with Rodr\u00edguez, calling her a \"terrific person.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday night, Machado said she told Mr. Trump during their meeting that Venezuela \"is ready to move forward swiftly and responsibly toward a democratic transition and toward a long-term relationship between the United States and Venezuela\u2014one that is mutually beneficial and puts people at the center.\"",
      "She said the two had a \"calm and in-depth discussion\" about the challenges facing the Latin American country. She also said she spoke to Mr. Trump about Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, the opposition leader who ran against Maduro in the disputed 2024 election, before fleeing the country. Machado was part of the coalition that supported Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's candidacy.",
      "In her statement, she referred to Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as the \"President-elect of Venezuela.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Machado to be Venezuela's next president, as some thought he might after Maduro's\u00a0arrest, despite the recognition she's received for her efforts to restore democracy to the struggling country. He has said he thinks it would be \"tough\" for Machado to lead Venezuela because \"she doesn't have the support within \u2014 or the respect within \u2014 the country.\"",
      "But Machado, asked in a recent\u00a0interview by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil if she believes she is the right person to lead Venezuela in the first chapter of its post-Maduro future, said that \"the people of Venezuela have already chosen,\" adding that her coalition is \"ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president \"was looking forward to this meeting and he was expecting it to be a good and positive discussion with Miss Machado, who is really a remarkable and brave voice for many people of the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "As for the president's assessment that it would be hard for her to lead Venezuela because, in his words, she lacks the support, Leavitt said \"at this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed.\"",
      "On Thursday morning, the Pentagon confirmed the seizure of yet another oil tanker in the Caribbean, at least the sixth such seizure of a tanker carrying Venezuelan oil.",
      "The U.S. officially began selling Venezuelan oil this week. The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500 million, has been completed, an administration official said Wednesday. Mr. Trump says the U.S. will be selling up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, if not more.",

    "summary": "Authorities said the alleged scheme involved 39 players, 17 different NCAA Division I men's basketball teams and 29 games.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors charged 26 people in an alleged point-shaving scheme involving dozens of college basketball players, authorities announced Thursday.",
      "U.S. Attorney David Metcalf said the scheme involved 39 players and 17 different NCAA Division I men's basketball teams, and alleged the conspiracy either fixed or attempted to fix 29 games.",
      "\"This was a massive scheme,\" Metcalf told reporters during a news conference in Philadelphia. \"It enveloped the world of college basketball.\"",
      "According to the indictment unsealed Thursday, players were allegedly bribed to tank games to enrich sports gamblers.",
      "\"This was a significant and rampant corruption of college athletics,\" Metcalf said.",
      "Some alleged attempts to fix games were unsuccessful for various reasons, including players who didn't cooperate with the scheme or others who failed to make games go a certain way, Metcalf said.",
      "\"In basketball, one player could substantially influence a game in ways that in other sports you cannot, but it's not a guarantee,\" Metcalf said. \"But by and large, the scheme was very successful.\"",
      "The allegations cover a period between September 2022 and February 2025. The indictment also includes allegations of  influencing or fixing Chinese Basketball Association men's basketball games.",
      "Some of the people allegedly involved in the scheme were former college players who are accused of bribing current college players to shave points on games so bettors could capitalize.",
      "Metcalf said the bribes could range between $10,000 and $30,000 per game. The people behind the alleged scheme are accused of finding games in which a corrupted player was on a team that was favored to lose and then bribing the player to deliberately underperform during the game and not cover the point spread, Metcalf said.",
      "\"For example, if a team was favored to lose by 4 points, the player would receive a bribe to underperform so that his team would lose by more than that,\" Metcalf said at a news conference announcing the charges in Philadelphia.",
      "Games involving the following teams were allegedly rigged or impacted, investigators say: Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Butler,\u00a0DePaul, Duquesne, East Carolina, Florida Atlantic, Fordham, Georgetown,\u00a0Kennesaw State, Kent State, La Salle, McNeese State, Nicholls State, Ohio University, St. Louis University, St. John's, SUNY Buffalo, Tulane and Western Michigan University.",
      "\"An extensive international criminal conspiracy of NCAA players, alumni and professional bettors who fixed games across the country and poisoned the American spirit of competition for monetary gain,\" Metcalf said.",
      "Tulane said in a statement it would cooperate with authorities \"where appropriate\" after Kevin Cross, a former forward for the school, was charged in the indictment. Cross was accused of taking a bribe of approximately $30,000 to keep Tulane from covering the spread in a 2024 game against East Carolina. Cross was also accused of discussing an attempt to fix a game later that year against Florida Atlantic, but the attempted fix wasn't successful, according to the indictment.",
      "Ohio University said that none of its players, coaches and staff were involved in the alleged scheme. According to the indictment, people involved in the scheme allegedly wanted SUNY Buffalo players to ensure that their team didn't cover the point spread for the first half of a game against Ohio in 2024.",
      "Brian Browne, a St. John's spokesperson, said in a statement provided to CBS News that neither the school or any of its current or former players were \"cited for wrongdoing in the indictment unsealed today.\"",
      "Kent State also said that it appeared in the indictment because of allegations made against another team. According to the indictment, SUNY Buffalo players attempted but ultimately failed to prevent their team from beating the spread in the first half of a 2024 game against Kent State.",
      "DePaul and La Salle said that none of their current players were named in the indictment and that the schools would cooperate with the investigation.",
      "The scheme initially unfolded when former Chicago Bulls player Antonio Blakeney allegedly colluded with professional sports bettors Marvis Fairley and Shane Hennen to fix Chinese Basketball Association games, Metcalf said.",
      "\"The scheme proved lucrative,\" Metcalf said. \"Mr. Hennen, we allege, texted a confederate that the only things certain in life were 'death, taxes and Chinese basketball.'\"",
      "The scheme was then moved to the U.S., where other people were brought into the fold as it focused on recruiting NCAA players.",
      "\"They picked these men because they were well connected in the world of college basketball,\" Metcalf said. \"They knew the players, many of them were players themselves, they were alumni, they were trainers, they were recruiters, they were networkers, they were people of influence, and because of that influence, they added gravitas and legitimacy to the scheme.\"",
      "NCAA President Charlie Baker responded to the newly revealed allegations by saying that the organization has finished or opened investigations into almost all of the teams named.",
      "\"The pattern of college basketball game integrity conduct revealed by law enforcement today is not entirely new information to the NCAA,\" Baker said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes less than three months after NBA mainstays Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones were among dozens of people arrested in a sweeping FBI crackdown on\u00a0alleged illegal gambling rings.",

    "summary": "Once among the hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, overdose deaths are falling in Ohio, though challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "Cincinnati\u00a0\u2014 A decade ago, the streets around Cincinnati, Ohio, became a front line for America's deadliest drug crisis.",
      "Tom Synan, police chief of nearby Newton, and head of Hamilton County's Addiction Response Coalition, can still point out the places where opioid overdoses were once common, and where first responders were pushed to the brink.",
      "\"August 19th through the 27th of 2016 \u2014 carfentanil hit the streets of Cincinnati,\" Synan told CBS News. \"We've never been the same, and the country has never been the same.\"",
      "Carfentanil is an ultrapotent synthetic opioid used to tranquilize elephants and other large mammals, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The drug is about 100 times more potent than fentanyl and 10,000 times more potent than morphine.",
      "In Ohio, the impact was immediate and deadly.",
      "There were nearly 400 carfentanil-involved deaths reported in the state in the second half of 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That year, Ohio recorded nearly 3,500 overdose deaths involving any opioid, up 35% from the year prior, according to the Ohio Department of Health.",
      "Nearly a decade later, the crisis looks markedly different. Once among the hardest hit in all of America, these areas are now part of a historic reversal.",
      "\"We're in the fourth consecutive year of seeing a reduction in overdose deaths,\" Synan said. His team works not only to bust suppliers, but to treat addicts.",
      "Nationwide, the crisis peaked in 2023 at 111,000 total overdose deaths. It has fallen every 12-month period since, according to the CDC. For the 12-month period ending in August 2025, the predicted number of drug overdose deaths was down to about 73,000, the CDC said.",
      "Researchers have credited that decrease, in part, to the overdose antidote naloxone and a sudden drop in the potency of drugs coming from China \u2014 something Synan has seen as well.",
      "The rest is more complicated.",
      "By labeling illicit fentanyl a \"weapon of mass destruction\" last month, President Trump is promising a crackdown on suppliers and dealers. CBS News asked people at Cincinnati's Findlay Market about using that term, and found that hardline message is often appreciated by those closest to the crisis.",
      "\"I had a couple friends lost throughout the years,\" one man behind the counter said. \"I mean it is [a weapon of mass destruction] and they put it in everything. It's sickening.\"",
      "But some feel using the label doesn't help solve the problem.",
      "\"We've been having a war on drugs for decades and we're still fighting it, trying to combat it,\" another employee said. \"And it's always going to be a new drug popping up to replace something that we think that we put on the shelf. I don't think the label matters at all.\"",
      "As for Synan, he says what's mattered more is not enforcement but the treatment of addiction, including the millions of federal dollars spent on programs like his, checking on addicts and getting them help.",

      "Descending under four large parachutes, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov landed in the Pacific off San Diego at 3:41 a.m. EST, closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "\"On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew 11,\" a SpaceX flight controller radioed.",
      "\"It's so good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams that got us there and back,\" Cardman replied.",
      "SpaceX support crews stationed near the landing site quickly reached the gently bobbing spacecraft and hauled it aboard a company recovery ship where flight surgeons were standing by to carry out initial medical checks.",
      "Under strict medical privacy guidelines, NASA has not identified the astronaut who had the medical issue in orbit or provided any details about its nature.",
      "But the crew appeared healthy and in good spirts as they were helped out of the cramped capsule and onto waiting stretchers -- normal procedure for returning station crews -- smiling and waving as they began re-adjusting to gravity after five-and-a-half months in weightlessness.",
      "\"All crew members are currently undergoing the routine post-splashdown medical evaluation,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a post-landing news conference. \"The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so.\"",
      "All four were expected to be flown to shore by helicopter for more extensive diagnostic evaluation at an unidentified area hospital.",
      "\"All four crew members will be transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation, taking advantage of medical resources on Earth to provide the best care possible,\" NASA said in a blog post.",
      "\"Following a planned overnight hospital stay, the crew will return to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will reunite with their families and undergo standard post-flight reconditioning and evaluations.\"",
      "Left behind in orbit were Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who took over command of the space station from Fincke, and the cosmonaut's two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched last November for a planned eight-month stay in space.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space on Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "But last Wednesday, the day before a planned spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke, one of the crew members experienced a medical issue of some sort and the next day, NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape, but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "None of the crew members mentioned the issue in the week between their initial request for a private medical conference and their return to Earth. In a final post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of Mount Fuji, saying \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven: Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flyer gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",

    "summary": "The average interest rate on a typical mortgage dipped to 6.06%, the lowest level since September 2022, according to Freddie Mac.",
    "story": [
      "The average interest rate on a conventional mortgage in the U.S. dropped to 6.06%, the lowest level in more than three years, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.",
      "A recent dip in mortgage rates has spurred homebuying activity, with purchase applications on the rise and more owners acting to refinance their loans, according to the government-sponsored enterprise.",
      "A year ago, the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.04%. The last time the rate on a typical mortgage was lower was Sept. 15, 2022, when it was at 6.02%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week, dropping to 5.38% from 5.46% last week. A year ago, that average rate was at 6.27%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates began ticking down in July in anticipation of a series of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which began in September and continued last month.",
      "Although the central bank doesn't set rates for home loans, trimming its benchmark rate often points to lower inflation or softer economic growth, spurring investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Although mortgage rates are easing, homeownership remains beyond the means of many Americans.",
      "A January report from Attom, a provider of property data, found that median-priced homes are less affordable than usual in 99% of the 594 counties for which sufficient data were available. The national median home price has hovered around $365,000, which is a record high, the group noted.",
      "\"Many Americans were priced out of buying a home in 2025, and affordability remains worse than historic norms in most markets,\" Attom CEO Rob Barber said in a statement earlier this month.",
      "The cost of a typical home has climbed 54% of the past five years, while typical wages have risen 29%, the group also noted, citing federal labor data.",
      "Trump's housing proposals",
      "President Trump last week announced two measures aimed at promoting homeownership, proposing to bar institutional investors from buying homes and also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds.",
      "Experts said the proposed ban could ease pressure on home prices, citing research showing that large investors can drive up home prices in communities where they invest.",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, has estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points,",
      "Home prices have also surged because of a dearth of affordable housing. The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address that shortage,\u00a0according\u00a0to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Christy Bunce, president of mortgage lender New American Funding, told CBS News that more prospective buyers entering the market would drive up home prices.\u00a0 \"But I don't think we are in a market where we're going to see crazy appreciation,\" she added.",
      "Lower mortgage rates also present an opportunity for current homeowners to refinance their loans, Bunce added.",
      "\"It's a good time to refinance, because nobody has a crystal ball to figure out what rates are going to do in the future,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Erik Schmitt, a Chase Home Lending executive, said that homeowners \"may be able to significantly reduce their monthly mortgage payment or shorten their loan term\" as borrowing costs ease.",
      "\"That said, it's important for homeowners to factor in closing costs, how much remains on their loan balance, and overall financial and life goals when considering whether to refinance,\" he noted.",

    "summary": "Some Americans are dropping their Affordable Care Act health plans after tax subsidies lapsed and their premiums spiked.",
    "story": [
      "As the window for Americans to enroll in an Affordable Care Act health plan closes in most states today, millions of Americans remain in limbo as Congress weighs whether to extend tax subsidies designed to lower the cost of Obamacare insurance.",
      "Congress has been locked in a showdown for months over the fate of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which\u00a0expired on Dec. 31. The\u00a0fight over the subsidies\u00a0was central to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which dragged on for six weeks.",
      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states. However, 10 states are offering an extended enrollment window to give residents extra time to select a plan.",
      "States with extended ACA enrollment deadlines, according to healthinsurance.org:",
      "California: Jan. 31Connecticut: Jan.\u00a0 31District of Columbia: Jan.\u00a0 31Massachusetts: Jan. 23Illinois: Jan. 31New Jersey: Jan. 31New York: Jan. 31Pennsylvania: Jan. 31Rhode Island: Jan. 31Virginia: Jan. 30",

      "For those yet to enroll in an ACA plan, the higher costs are sure to be a consideration. Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",
      "\"Any changes to the ACA tax credits mid-year would complicate the logistics and slow down the reopening of enrollment and the premium relief,\" he said in a post.",

    "story": [
      "Madison Sheahan, the No. 2 official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and close ally of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, is leaving the agency to run for Congress, two U.S. officials familiar with the move told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Sheahan was installed as ICE's deputy director in March, when the Trump administration overhauled the agency's leadership amid increased pressure for officials to ramp up immigration arrests and deportations across the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Noem confirmed Sheahan's departure. She said Sheahan would be \"a great defender of freedom when she goes to Congress,\" noting she has known her for years.",
      "\"Madison Sheahan is a work horse, strong executor, and terrific leader who led the men and women of ICE to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem added. \"We wish her all the best.\"",
      "While Sheahan and Noem have a longstanding relationship, her installation as the second-highest ranking official at ICE frustrated some agency officials, who noted the 28-year-old lacked significant law enforcement experience.",
      "Before coming to ICE, Sheahan was the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Before that, she was an aide for Noem during her governorship in South Dakota.",
      "In a message to ICE employees posted on X shortly after this story was first published, Sheahan said she was proud of having \"strengthened\" ICE and \"restored its purpose.\"",
      "\"As I depart the agency, I want to say that it has been the honor of my life to serve my country with all of you,\" Sheahan wrote in her message. \"I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Noem for their leadership and for their steadfast commitment to our agency.\"",
      "Noem announced Thursday that Charles Wall, who was recently the lead lawyer at ICE and was an ICE attorney for 14 years, will replace Sheahan as the agency's deputy director.",
      "As the agency in charge of deportations and immigration arrests in the interior of the country, ICE has been at the forefront of President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. The administration has deployed thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents to major American cities, where their actions have been denounced by local leaders and residents as harsh and heavy-handed.",

    "summary": "Though DOJ says there's \"no basis\" for criminal civil rights probe in ICE shooting case, some legal experts say the division's lack of involvement here is unheard of.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since the fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent, a dozen Justice Department prosecutors and career officials have left their positions \u2014 some of whom have expressed frustration over the department's handling of the case.",
      "Senior U.S. Justice Department leaders have ordered federal prosecutors who specialize in probing civil rights crimes not to pursue an investigation into Good's shooting death in Minneapolis last week.",
      "The sidelining of the Civil Rights Division's criminal section is highly unusual, and appears to break with the Justice Department's own manual, which calls for its involvement in cases that are designated as being in the \"national interest.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CBS News in a statement that there's \"no basis\" for a criminal civil rights probe in this case.",
      "But numerous legal experts who spoke with CBS News disagreed, saying that the lack of involvement by the Civil Rights Division in a fatal officer-involved shooting like the one in Minneapolis is unheard of and deeply concerning.",
      "Six career officials in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section announced they will be departing, telling colleagues in a meeting that the handling of the shooting in Minneapolis marks the latest in a series of troubling actions to pull back on criminal civil rights enforcement in America by the department.",
      "At least six federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota have also quit, after they were pressured to investigate the wife of Renee Good and to treat the case as an assault on a federal officer.",
      "What does the Civil Rights Division's Criminal Section do?",
      "The criminal section of the Civil Rights Division is one of the Justice Department's oldest offices, dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era.",
      "In addition to prosecuting hate crimes, the section also handles cases involving local, state or federal law enforcement misconduct, which can include the use of excessive force and sexual misconduct.",
      "The use of excessive force by a law enforcement officer is typically prosecuted under 18 USC 242, a statute which makes it a crime for anyone acting \"under color of law,\" such as a police officer, to willfully deprive a person of their constitutional rights.",
      "The law can be used to prosecute a variety of misconduct allegations, from physical or sexual abuse, to making false arrests or failing to protect people in custody from having their rights violated by others.",
      "A violation of the statute is a misdemeanor, though if prosecutors can prove certain aggravating factors such as kidnapping, sexual abuse or death, they can seek life in prison or even the death penalty.",
      "There is no statute of limitations on cases involving excessive force that lead to death. In theory, the next\u00a0administration could still pursue a federal color-under-law criminal case down the road, as long as the target has not received a presidential pardon.",
      "Cases in the national interest",
      "The Justice Department's Justice Manual calls for coordination between the assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division and the local U.S. Attorney's office in cases that are deemed to be in the \"national interest.\"",
      "As a general matter, cases deemed to be in the national interest may involve novel issues of law or have important public policy considerations.",
      "A case like the one in Minneapolis, however, would automatically be deemed to be a \"national interest\" case under the Justice Manual because it involves an alleged violation of federal criminal civil rights laws that resulted in death.",
      "In national interest cases, the assistant attorney general for Civil Rights is supposed to make staffing decisions, and can choose whether to pursue the case jointly with a U.S. Attorney's office or as a stand-alone Civil Rights Division case.",
      "The manual also requires the U.S. Attorney's office in the relevant district, the FBI and the Civil Rights Division to coordinate and consult before any public statements are made to the press.",
      "U.S. Attorneys' offices must obtain prior approval from the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division before seeking an indictment on a civil rights case that is deemed to be in the national interest.",
      "Past cases involving use of force by law enforcement officer",
      "Most of the country's high-profile cases involving use of force by a law enforcement officer have involved the Civil Rights Division's criminal section.",
      "In Minnesota, the division prosecuted former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin for violating George Floyd's rights, resulting in his death.",
      "The federal case was pursued in addition to state charges against Chauvin. He was convicted of murder in the state trial and pleaded guilty in the federal civil rights case.",
      "The division also pursued federal charges against the Louisville Police Department officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, after they entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant. Former Kentucky police detective Brett Hankison was convicted of using excessive force in Taylor's death and sentenced to almost three years in prison. Another former Louisville officer, Kelly Goodlett, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy for helping obtain the warrant. Two other Louisville officers, former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany, also face charges over Taylor's death. Jaynes and Meany are charged with federal civil rights offenses and obstruction of justice for their involvement in the preparing and authorizing of an affidavit for the search warrant that ultimately led to the shooting.",
      "In one notable case, the Civil Rights Division's criminal section investigated and declined to bring charges against a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan bill seeks to make it a crime to publicly share identifying information about special operations forces with the intent of threatening, intimidating or inciting violence against them.",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Budd of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are introducing the bill, first shared with CBS News, in the upper chamber Thursday. The bill is titled the Special Operator Protection Act.",
      "The move comes after a journalist shared a photo and brief biography of a military officer who he said was the commander of the elite Army Delta Force, which carried out the operation earlier this month to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Seth Harp, an Army veteran turned journalist who has been highly critical of special forces, said his X account was locked until he deleted certain posts.",
      "The legislation from Budd and Shaheen aims to protect special forces, other Department of Defense personnel who conduct sensitive missions, federal law enforcement officers who support special forces, as well as their immediate family members.",
      "It would prohibit publicly sharing identifying information of these service members, including their name, photo or image of their home in connection with their employer, birthdate, Social Security number, home address, phone numbers, personal email and biometric data.",
      "\"There is no compelling reason for their identities to be made public, especially given the significant risks from foreign threats,\" Budd said in a statement.",
      "Shaheen echoed the concern that they could be harmed by foreign adversaries, saying the bill \"would help shield those who put their lives on the line to advance America's national security.\"",
      "The penalties for violating the law would include fines and up to five years in prison. Death or serious injury to those whose information has been shared carries increased penalties, including up to life in prison.",
      "But the bill is also likely to raise questions about the ability of the press to report critically on military personnel.",
      "Harp has pushed back on allegations that he had \"doxxed\" the officer, saying in a lengthy statement that he had posted information that was publicly available online.",
      "\"I did not post any personally identifying information about him, such as his birthday, social security number, home address, phone number, email address, the names of his family members or pictures of his house,\" he said on Jan. 5.",
      "At that time, he said the information he posted was still available online \"for all the world to see.\" In defense of sharing the information, he said every \"civilian official and military officer in the American chain of command\" involved in the operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny.\"",
      "He told CBS News on Thursday, \"This law, if passed, would never survive judicial review. How can you criminalize naming high ranking military officials whose names are already publicly known, such as the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, or the Delta Force commander? Every officer at or above the rank of colonel has to be confirmed by Congress. It's nonsensical to make it a crime to name them when they're already public figures, named in the Congressional Record.\"",
      "Last week, the House Oversight Committee adopted by voice vote a motion to subpoena Harp. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida accused the journalist of putting the Delta Force commander and his family at risk and called for a criminal investigation into what she described as \"leaking classified information.\" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told CBS News on Thursday that Harp has not been subpoenaed at this time.",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department referring Harp for criminal prosecution, Luna said the incident \"raises serious concerns\" for U.S. national security.",
      "\"The gravity of such conduct is magnified by the foreseeable consequences, including the endangerment of U.S. personnel and, in this specific case, his family who have endured harassment and danger to their safety,\" the Jan. 7 letter said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it had received Luna's referral and said it \"takes protecting the safety and security of our military personnel extremely seriously.\" Harp told CBS News the Justice Department has not reached out to him.",
      "Harp has maintained that the commander's identity is not classified. The identities of Delta Force commanders are not generally public.",
      "\"The identity of the Delta Force commander is not classified, so this entire discussion is premised on Rep. Luna's misunderstanding of the military and the law,\" Harp told CBS News.",
      "Press freedom advocates defended Harp in\u00a0a letter to House leaders earlier this week. They said the subpoena \"poses a grave danger to the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.\"",
      "\"The public identities of public officials with command responsibility over controversial political or military decisions are a matter of public concern and are not (or cannot properly be) classified, especially with respect to a past operation,\" they said, adding that \"journalists have a right under the First Amendment to publish even classified information.\"",
      "GOP Reps. Richard Hudson and Pat Harrigan of North Carolina are introducing a companion bill in the House.",
      "\"The Special Operator Protection Act closes a clear gap in the law and makes one thing clear: if you recklessly expose our nation's heroes, there will be consequences,\" Hudson said in a statement.",
      "Hudson's district includes Fort Bragg, home to several special operations forces and the topic of Harp's book, The Fort Bragg Cartel.",
      "Harrigan, who was a member of the special forces, said the legislation \"closes a real hole in the law and makes sure our Special Operations Forces aren't left exposed after carrying out some of the most dangerous missions this country asks anyone to do.\"",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that journalist Seth Harp had said that every American involved in the Venezuela operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny,\" but in his post, he had written that every \"civilian official and military officer in the American chain of command\" involved in the operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny.\" The article has been updated.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:30:20 -0500",
    "summary": "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" said GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno, who previously expected the compromise to be unveiled this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican senators said Thursday that a long-sought bipartisan compromise to extend the expired Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits for two years has stalled.",
      "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, blaming Democratic leaders for the lack of movement on the issue. \"So for me, I'm going to take a pause until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader and his leadership team that they are willing to contemplate a deal that extends these enhanced premium tax credits with the reforms that we've outlined.\"",
      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Moreno \"is trying to distract from the reality.\"",
      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",
      "\"The only path forward at this moment is for Senate Republicans to do the right thing by the American people and pass the damn bill that we sent over to you,\" he told reporters at a news conference.",

      "New data shows more Americans are filing for bankruptcy, the latest indication that\u00a0price pressures\u00a0and an uneven economy are leaving some households strapped for cash.",
      "Total consumer bankruptcy filings jumped 12% from 478,752 in 2024 to 533,949 in 2025, according to Epiq AACER, a platform that provides U.S. bankruptcy filing data. Epiq, which tracks Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 filings, relies on data provided through the U.S. Courts' PACER system, an electronic database that houses federal court records.",
      "The surge in filings comes as American consumers \u2014 and businesses \u2014 face a slate of economic pressures, ranging from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs, experts told CBS News.",
      "John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, said Americans typically hold off on filing for bankruptcy as long as they can, meaning the conditions that led them to file for bankruptcy may not necessarily be tied to current economic issues.",
      "\"There is often a lag before economic conditions translate to higher bankruptcies,\" he said.",
      "Still, he said the rising cost of medical insurance, mounting credit card debt and the restart of student loan repayments are serving as some of the major catalysts for bankruptcies. Inflation has also made it tougher for Americans to cover expenses while paying down their debt, he added.",
      "\"There comes a point where the mounting bills, the increasing balances on credit cards, all those things just weigh people down so much,\" Rao said.",
      "A\u00a0December CBS News poll\u00a0found most Americans are struggling to afford basic living costs in the U.S., including health care, food and housing.",
      "A bankruptcy filing can provide consumers with a financial reset, stopping collection calls and wiping out some or all of their debt. But the relief comes with trade-offs: Bankruptcy can severely damage a credit score, delay the ability to buy a home and make it tougher to qualify for loans in the future.",
      "Commercial filings drift higher",
      "Commercial bankruptcies are also on the rise, with filings up 5% from 2024 to 2025, according to Epiq AACER's data. In 2025, consumers lost a number of national and regional retailers \u2014 including Forever 21 and Joann Fabrics \u2014 that failed to stay afloat even after seeking bankruptcy protection.",
      "Chapter 11 bankruptcies, which allow companies to restructure their finances, were up just 1% from 2024 to 2025, driven by higher interest rates in 2023 and 2024 along with inflation, according to Christopher Ward, the co-chair of bankruptcy and restructuring at Polsinelli Law Firm.",
      "Among the most notable recent filings is Saks Global, which filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman said it has secured financing that will allow it to keep stores open as the bankruptcy proceeds.",
      "Pre-pandemic normalization",
      "Experts emphasized that the increase in commercial and consumer bankruptcies represents a return to pre-pandemic norms.",
      "Bankruptcies dipped during COVID as an injection of government funding helped prop up cash-strapped businesses and American households. Forbearance plans also gave some mortgage payers and car owners more financial breathing room, said Michael Hunter, vice president of Epiq AACER.",
      "However, once those temporary relief measures faded, bankruptcy filings drifted higher, with data showing an upward trend since 2022.",
      "\"We're just slowly coming back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hunter said. \"Is it a huge event? No. Is it a big increase from what we've experienced over the past five years? Yes.\"",
      "While the overall number of bankruptcies is still below their pre-COVID levels, they could start to accelerate, Rao told CBS News.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:07:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",
      "H&R Block notes that Americans who aren't yet receiving Social Security can still claim the $6,000 deduction.",

    "summary": "President Trump is threatening to invoke a centuries-old law to deploy troops to Minnesota. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he might invoke a centuries-old law known as the Insurrection Act to send troops into Minnesota, threatening a major escalation between the federal government and state officials.",
      "\"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat comes amid protests over the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and increased tensions over immigration operations in the Twin Cities. The administration has sent thousands of federal law enforcement agents to the state in recent weeks to investigate fraud and implement the latest phase of its immigration crackdown.",
      "The invocation of the Insurrection Act could clear the way for the Trump administration to deploy troops to the state over the objections of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and local officials. Here's what to know about the law:",
      "What is the Insurrection Act?",
      "The Insurrection Act has its roots in the 1790s and evolved over the decades, with the last substantive amendment coming in 1874. The law as written gives the president broad authority to deploy troops and enlist state militias to address unrest on U.S. soil, largely at his own discretion.",
      "The statute has three main sections:",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.\u00a0The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"\u00a0The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.",
      "The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"",
      "The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "\"The basic idea, which emerged early on in the United States, is that there might be circumstances when state and local law enforcement resources and state and local militia, now the National Guard, would not be able to adequately contain protests or disturbances on the ground in their communities,\" said William Banks, a professor emeritus at Syracuse University and expert on the domestic role of the military. \"So the Insurrection Act allows the president to call forth the regular military or other federal forces to come into state or local communities and engage in law enforcement in an emergency circumstance.\"",
      "When can the Insurrection Act be used?",
      "The law leaves it up to the president to determine when it should be invoked.",
      "Joseph Nunn, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who has studied the statute extensively, said the act has historically been a \"tool for emergency situations when civilian authorities are overwhelmed by some sudden crisis \u2014 an insurrection, mass civil unrest.\"",
      "The law gives the president wide latitude to determine when an insurrection exists and how long troops can be used to address it. But \"broad discretion is not the same thing as infinite discretion, and broad discretion can be abused,\" Nunn said.",
      "\"The Insurrection Act was written to apply when all hell breaks loose. And when all hell breaks loose, of course, is in the eye of the beholder,\" Banks said. He noted that the basis for triggering the act \"is incredibly open-ended\" and the statute \"basically says the president can do this whenever he determines that it's impractical to enforce the laws.\"",
      "\"There are no procedural requirements, like a consultation with state and local officials, reports to Congress, sunsets \u2014 you know, do it for 30 days or 60 days, but then you've got to get out unless Congress renews it by statute, something like that,\" Banks said. \"It's just open-ended. The president does it. He does it on his own say so, and he doesn't have any particular criteria to follow.\"",
      "An 1878 law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the military for law enforcement purposes. But the Insurrection Act is the law's \"most important exception,\" said Nunn, and its invocation means the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply.",
      "When has the Insurrection Act been invoked?",
      "The Insurrection Act and its predecessor have been used to address 30 crises over the years, according to a tally by the Brennan Center. It was invoked most recently in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush ordered troops deployed to California to suppress the L.A. riots at the request of the state's governor.",
      "The law has typically been invoked when states request assistance from the federal government. Presidents have invoked the act unilaterally only five times in the past 130 years, all during the Civil Rights Era, according to Nunn.",
      "In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and sent in the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to enforce desegregation. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act three times over the objections of state officials, once in Mississippi and twice in Alabama. Johnson also used the law unilaterally in Alabama in 1965.",
      "\"The idea is that it should rarely, if ever, be invoked, and indeed, in our history, it hasn't been utilized very often,\" Banks said.",
      "Has Trump used the Insurrection Act before?",
      "No, but he has threatened to.",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump entertained the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to cities across the U.S. in response to widespread racial unrest following the killing of George Floyd.",
      "\"If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" he said in a speech at the White House in June 2020. He ultimately decided against doing so, with reports at the time indicating that administration officials were split over deploying troops.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the use of the act since returning to the White House last year. In October, he told reporters that \"if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the law.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because \u2026 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "Hasn't Trump sent troops into other cities?",
      "Yes, but he hasn't used the Insurrection Act to do so, and a recent Supreme Court decision limited his ability to send in troops under a separate authority.",
      "Last year, Mr. Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to cities in California, Illinois, Tennessee and Oregon, as well as Washington, D.C., under an authority known as Title 10, the portion of the federal code that deals with the armed forces. The administration argued the troops were needed to support immigration agents and protect federal property.",
      "Several cities and states where officials objected to the troops being deployed filed lawsuits seeking to block them. In one case, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sought an order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization and deployment of the Illinois National Guard was illegal. A district judge agreed and blocked the administration's plans.",
      "The dispute made its way to the Supreme Court. In December, the justices declined to freeze the lower court order in a narrow, preliminary 6-3 decision. A week later, Mr. Trump said the National Guard was leaving Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.",
      "\"I think the Supreme Court ruling certainly makes it more likely that they will try to use the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn said, while noting that the justices did not decide the case on the merits.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota?",
      "The president said in his Truth Social post that he might invoke the law to protect the 3,000 ICE agents and other federal officers who have been sent to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of the administration's immigration crackdown and fraud investigations.",
      "The administration has targeted Minnesota on a number of fronts in recent weeks amid renewed scrutiny over massive fraud schemes that have been uncovered in the state over the past several years. The president and other administration officials have pinned the blame for the scandal on Walz, the governor and Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024. The increased immigration operations in Minnesota are taking place alongside a surge in federal resources aimed at investigating fraud.",
      "Local officials have said the federal agents are responsible for inflaming tensions on the ground, pointing to the heavy-handed tactics of ICE agents and the deadly shooting of Good last week. Administration officials have said the agent was acting in self-defense and that protesters and activists are obstructing federal law enforcement.",
      "Invoking the Insurrection Act would let the president deploy National Guard or active-duty troops to Minnesota to protect immigration agents and federal buildings. Using the act would, in theory, place the deployments on firmer legal ground than previous deployments.",
      "But Nunn, the Brennan Center scholar, said the events in Minnesota do not warrant invoking the act.",
      "\"Basically, it exists for a kind of narrow set of crisis situations, and none of the criteria that would justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act are present in Minnesota,\" Nunn said. \"What exactly is the insurrection? There is no insurrection. Are the insurrectionists the people of Minneapolis? Who exactly is being protected?\"",
      "Nunn said that it's \"hard to say how much unrest there actually is.\"",
      "\"But to the extent that there is any, it's largely being fomented by the lawlessness and violence of ICE and [Customs and Border Protection]. And to the extent that there is violence, it is primarily being perpetrated by ICE and CBP,\" he said. \"And the government can't go to an American city and foment unrest through lawless, violent conduct and then turn around and invoke the Insurrection Act, claiming that they need to do this to suppress that unrest.\"",
      "Could a court block Trump's invocation of the Insurrection Act?",
      "Yes, but a legal fight would take place in largely uncharted territory, according to Nunn. A president's invocation of the Insurrection Act has never been blocked by a court.",
      "\"There's very little case law on this subject,\" Nunn said. \"One, the Insurrection Act simply isn't invoked very often. It's a tool that's used very rarely. Two, it has never been flagrantly abused in this way. There have been invocations of the Insurrection Act that I would say weren't perfectly justified, weren't obviously necessary, but it has never been outright abused.\"",
      "Nunn said that \"no state has ever challenged an invocation of the Insurrection Act and there's only ever been one case where anyone\" has, a Supreme Court case known as Martin v. Mott in 1827. That decision found that the president has broad emergency powers, but Nunn said the particulars of the case mean it might not \"reflect a general rule.\"",
      "\"The available judicial precedent, which is very limited, suggests that there's a fairly narrow set of circumstances where using the Insurrection Act is appropriate,\" Nunn said. \"Your argument would almost certainly be that the president has exceeded the scope of his discretion with the statute, that he's using it for a situation that Congress did not intend to authorize.\"",
      "If a legal challenge made its way to the Supreme Court, Nunn said the justices' Title 10 ruling might give a hint of how they would decide.",
      "\"One of the messages that should be taken from the Supreme Court's ruling in December is that at least six justices are uncomfortable with the way that the Trump administration has been using the military domestically, and were uncomfortable with those deployments, which makes sense, because the Trump administration has been seeking to insert the military into civilian law enforcement on a scale that has no precedent in modern American history, and that runs afoul of the law in a variety of ways,\" he said. \"So it makes sense that the justices, the Supreme Court, would be uncomfortable.\"",

      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. and Taiwan have agreed to a deal that would lower tariffs on goods from Taiwan to no more than 15%, and boost Taiwanese semiconductor companies' financing for U.S. operations by half a trillion dollars, the Trump administration announced Thursday.",
      "The 15% would be a slightly lower rate than the 20% rate imposed under President Trump's so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for most imports from Taiwan. The Department of Commerce announced the agreement Thursday, saying Taiwanese semiconductor and tech companies will make new investments totaling at least $250 billion to promote energy, AI and innovation in the U.S., and Taiwan will offer credit guarantees of at least $250 billion to expand the chip supply chain in the U.S. The Trump administration sees semiconductor chips as a critical component to future innovation, and to competing with China.",

    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week sets up a potential legal showdown between the state and federal government.",
      "If the state were to indict the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on criminal charges, he could try to claim a form of immunity conferred by the Constitution. Vice President JD Vance raised this the day after the shooting, asserting that the officer was immune from prosecution because he's a federal agent.",
      "\"That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job,\" Vance said. The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Good weaponized her vehicle, and said the officer acted in self-defense. However, local officials pointed to video of the shooting and raised doubts.",
      "The FBI and Justice Department are leading the investigation into the shooting after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension withdrew from the federal probe, saying it didn't have \"complete access\" to the case evidence.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Minnesota officials \"don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "But Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law, told CBS News it's \"simply false\" that the state lacks jurisdiction.",
      "Shapiro, who previously served as Illinois' solicitor general, said Minnesota has the authority to investigate and prosecute crimes committed in the state.",
      "But any attempt to bring state criminal charges over Good's death is likely to face legal obstacles arising from a claim of immunity under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.",
      "What is Supremacy Clause immunity?",
      "The Supremacy Clause, in Article VI of the Constitution, establishes federal law as supreme, superseding state law. It limits the ability of states to interfere with federal law through criminal prosecution. States may hold federal officials accountable for violating state law, unless state law conflicts with federal law; if there is a conflict, federal law prevails. But if state prosecutors have evidence federal officials acted in ways not related to their job duties or work policies, then state law prevails.",
      "Federal officials may be prosecuted if they \"acted beyond the scope of their duties, violated federal law, or behaved in an egregious or unwarranted manner,\" Bryna Godar, an attorney at the State Democracy Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin Law School, wrote in a brief explainer.",
      "The state is independently gathering its own evidence in the Good case. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty's office has set up an evidence portal that has received a \"substantial\" number of submissions, she said in an interview Monday with CBS Minnesota.",
      "Moriarty also said after the FBI took over sole authority of the investigation that her office has jurisdiction to review evidence and make a decision about charges because the shooting happened in Hennepin County.",
      "If a state prosecutor obtains an indictment or files criminal charges against a federal officer, the officer has the right to have any potential state charges in the case heard in federal court. It's at this point the officer might invoke immunity under the Supremacy Clause, says Robert McNamara, deputy litigation director for the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that litigates \"to end widespread abuse of government powers.\"",
      "How could the Supremacy Clause immunity be used?",
      "If charges were filed, Ross would likely appear before a federal judge and assert that he was invoking the doctrine, and that the actions he took in shooting Good were reasonable and necessary to fulfill his federal duties \u2014\u00a0 a separate question from whether the shooting constituted a crime.",
      "\"That's the doctrine that's going to be at the center of the fight,\" McNamara said.",
      "The federal government would not be a party in this fight. The immunity battle would be waged between the agent, in this case Ross, and the state of Minnesota,\u00a0 although the feds could provide support by hiring a defense attorney or filing an amicus brief.",
      "The court would have to answer two questions at that point, Seth W. Stoughton, a law professor at South Carolina School of Law, explained in an email to CBS News. First, was Ross acting within the scope of his duties, authorized by federal law?\u00a0 Second, was he performing his duties in a \"necessary and proper\" way?\"",
      "If the court determined the answer was \"yes\" to these questions, Ross could be granted immunity from the state prosecution, Stoughton said.",
      "The case could then be dismissed.",
      "If, however, the judge allowed the prosecution to proceed, it would remain in federal court with state laws applied.",
      "Federal courts \"have permitted state authorities to prosecute federal officers for using deadly force when they conclude that the force could have been unreasonable or excessive,\" Stoughon said.",
      "He cited a case from the early 1990s when an FBI sniper killed an unarmed woman during the standoff near Ruby Ridge. Idaho prosecutors charged the agent with involuntary manslaughter, and a federal court allowed it to proceed. (The case was later dropped by state prosecutors.)",
      "States have criminally prosecuted federal officials since the early 1880s, with mixed results. Experts say Supremacy Clause immunity is a complex legal process most often used during times of heightened tensions between the states and the federal government.",
      "If Ross was eventually convicted on state charges, he could not be pardoned by President Trump, Shapiro noted. The president has the power to pardon people only for federal offenses, not for state crimes.",

      "\"Let's turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,\" Walz wrote.",
      "Walz's statement also included \"an appeal to Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"I know this is scary,\" he wrote. \"We can \u2014 we must \u2014 speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O'Hara held a joint news conference late Wednesday night in which Frey also called for peace. O'Hara said his officers were struck by rocks, fireworks, ice chunks and snowballs. The chief said protesters crossed the line, and mutual aid from the Minnesota State Patrol and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office was called in.",
      "\"This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further,\" O'Hara said. \"I have faith that the investigators who are involved will follow every lead in this case and ensure it is completed to its logical conclusion.\"",
      "Frey once again called for ICE to leave Minneapolis.",
      "\"There's still a lot that we don't know at this time, but what I can tell you for certain is that this is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in, and at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to maintain order,\" Frey said.",
      "The mayor noted the stark contrast between the number of Minneapolis police officers and the thousands of federal agents now in the area.",
      "\"We have approximately 600 police officers in Minneapolis ... and there are approximately 3,000 ICE agents in the area,\" Frey said. \"We have ICE agents throughout our city and throughout our state who, along with Border Patrol, are creating chaos. This is not the path we should be on in America.\"",
      "Frey then took to social media late Wednesday night, saying, \"We cannot respond to Donald Trump's chaos with our own chaos.\"",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced on social media overnight it is investigating the shooting, and that it will be an independent investigation. O'Hara said the FBI was also on the scene collecting evidence.",
      "WCCO has also heard reports of protesters breaking into federal vehicles at the scene, and have reached out to police for more information.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche released a statement Wednesday night accusing Walz and Frey of stoking the violence.",
      "\"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting,\" Blanche said. \"Walz and Frey \u2014 I'm focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It's a promise.\"",
      "Details of the shooting",
      "According to law enforcement officials briefed on the incident, the shooting occurred around 7 p.m. during a targeted ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) action near North Sixth Street and North 24th Avenue.",
      "Officials say one man armed with a shovel \u2014 described as an \"illegal alien\" from Venezuela and the primary target of the operation \u2014 assaulted an ICE officer, striking the officer with the shovel and attempting to hit the agent's head. An ICE ERO agent then opened fire, striking the man in the leg.",
      "After being shot, the man fled into a residence. Law enforcement officials say they later determined the house contained three additional targets. All four individuals barricaded themselves inside the home.",
      "Due to the barricade situation, additional agents were called to the scene, officials said. Officers breached the house with the assistance of an ICE specialized tactical team. Officials believe all individuals inside the home were taken into custody.",
      "Homeland Security officials said in a statement the Venezuelan national initially fled law enforcement in a vehicle but soon crashed into a parked car before fleeing on foot.",
      "DHS issued a statement Wednesday evening saying the officer was assaulted by the man as he resisted arrest, and while they were on the ground struggling, \"two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.\"",
      "\"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,\" DHS officials said.",
      "Less than a hour before the shooting, Walz gave a rare primetime address\u00a0in which he called on Mr. Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to \"end this occupation.\" The governor also called on Minnesotans to film the actions of federal agents for use in future prosecutions.",
      "Late Wednesday night, Walz said on social media, \"State investigators have been on the scene in North Minneapolis.   I know you're angry. I'm angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets.   But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace.   Don't give him what he wants.\"",

      "Several key U.S. allies in the Middle East are aiming to stave off a military conflict between Iran and the United States by engaging in 72 hours of intensive diplomacy, a Gulf official told CBS News.",
      "The countries involved in the diplomatic push include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Oman, according to the Gulf official. The talks have focused on lowering the temperature in public rhetoric and avoiding military action that these states feared could trigger wider regional instability.",
      "To the U.S., the message has been to refrain from strikes on Iran, citing the region's security and economic vulnerabilities, while highlighting the risk that the U.S. could ultimately be affected as well.",
      "To Iran, the four Arab states conveyed that any counterattack on U.S. facilities in the Gulf would have serious consequences for Iran's relations with countries across the region.",
      "Thousands of American forces who are stationed in the Gulf region could be targets of potential Iranian retaliation in the event of a U.S. attack on Iran. The U.S. withdrew some personnel from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar this week as a \"precautionary measure,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News on Wednesday that Iran explicitly informed a number of countries that they would be targets of an Iranian missile attack if the U.S. were to strike. The U.S. embassies in Qatar and Saudi Arabia told Americans on Wednesday to avoid going to military bases in those two countries.",
      "\"Collectively, there's an agreement that once this spirals into an armed military escalation, there could be lots of consequences,\" the Gulf official told CBS News. \"Tensions have cooled temporarily, but we've still yet to see. The next period will also be crucial.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Wednesday that many stories on Iran \"have been based on anonymous sources who are pretending or guessing to know the president's thinking.\" Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"continues to closely monitor\" the situation in Iran, and will \"keep all of his options on the table.\"",

Iran temporarily closed its airspace overnight on Wednesday, indicating it may have been preparing for possible military action.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president suggested a military strike on Iran may not be imminent, telling reporters he'd heard the \"killing in Iran is stopping.\" Asked if that means military options are off the table, Mr. Trump said: \"We're going to watch and see what the process is.\"",

      "Russia says geopolitical tension in the Arctic is of \"the gravest concern,\" as European NATO members ramp up for war games in the region and Moscow seeks to highlight the disagreement between the Trump administration and its closest allies over Greenland.",
      "\"NATO has embarked on a course of accelerated militarization of the North, increasing its military presence there under the fictitious pretext of a growing threat from Moscow and Beijing,\" Russia's embassy in Belgium said in a statement late Wednesday.",
      "The statement went on to say that Russia advocates for peace, cooperation and dialogue in the region, but that, \"NATO members show no disposition to resolve issues in a constructive manner.\"",
      "\"The militaristic spirit within the alliance is only growing stronger, and given the disagreements that have emerged within the bloc over the Greenland issue, its ability to reach agreements is becoming increasingly unpredictable, including on Arctic matters,\" the Russian embassy said. \"We consider the alliance's line of escalating confrontation in the Arctic to be counterproductive and extremely dangerous.\"",
      "The statement came as top Trump administration officials met in Washington with Danish and Greenlandic officials to discuss Mr. Trump's repeated vows to make the vast, largely frozen island part of the United States. The White House says the U.S. needs control of the resource-rich island, long a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, for security reasons, claiming that Russia and China will otherwise take it over.",
      "Maps show why Greenland is so important as the Arctic warms",
      "Maps show why Greenland is so important as the Arctic warms",
      "America's European allies, and Greenland's own government, have vehemently rejected the notion of the U.S. taking control of the island, by any means, and argued that U.S. ownership is unnecessary for security reasons, as Greenland is already NATO territory.",
      "After the meeting, Denmark's foreign minister said his country and the U.S. still had \"fundamental\" differences over Greenland's future, but would continue to talk.",
      "EU leaders, meanwhile, have also sought to acknowledge Mr. Trump's concerns about rising security threats around Greenland.",
      "\"Geopolitical tensions have spread to the Arctic,\" Denmark's defense ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The Government of Greenland, and the Danish Ministry of Defence have therefore decided to continue the Danish Armed Forces' increased exercise activity in Greenland, in close cooperation with NATO allies.\"",
      "\"The purpose is to train the ability to operate under the unique Arctic conditions and to strengthen the alliance's footprint in the Arctic, benefiting both European and transatlantic security,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Don't listen to Russian propaganda,\" Lars-Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News on Thursday, calling the meeting in Washington between U.S., European and Greenlandic officials positive despite the lack of a resolution to the matter.",
      "\"I think it's positive that the clear disagreement that is there between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. will be taken into a platform, a high level working group,\" Brask said, calling it \"a good way of continuing finding out what we can do to solve this situation.\"",
      "\"It's all about talking. It's about communicating. It's trying to solve an issue that wasn't solvable in an hour's meeting yesterday,\" Brask said.",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark's Parliament, told CBS News on Thursday, \"Many of us were concerned that it would be the same as Zelenskyy when he was in the White House, and therefore, taking into account the whole situation, I think it was a success.\"",
      "\"What I hear from back home [in Greenland], which I think is very important to also emphasize, is that children are concerned. They're talking about their concerns at school. We have elders that are not sleeping because they are concerned. I think all of this that has happened has been offensive towards us. I think some of it has been appalling. And therefore, it's important to take out the intensity. And a little bit has been taken out from the meeting yesterday, but this is a marathon and not a short sprint, and we need to make sure that Greenland and Denmark stay as close an ally in this situation,\" Chemnitz said.",
      "Mr. Trump has disparaged efforts by Denmark to increase security for Greenland, saying Wednesday in a post on social media: \"Two dogsleds won't do it! Only the USA can!!!\"",
      "Denmark says it's invested almost $14 billion in Arctic security, and ahead of the military drills in the region, its European partners also signaled their investment in the island's defense.",
      "A small number of European troops were arriving in Greenland Thursday to participate in the upcoming exercise. Germany said it was sending 13 troops to Greenland's capital Nuuk. The Netherlands said it would be working with NATO to conduct joint reconnaissance ahead of the military exercise, and sending one officer from its navy, and Finland said it would be sending two liaison officers.",

    "summary": "As Trump steps back from threats against Iran, Kurdish Iranian opposition group says it's ready to help topple the regime, but the time isn't right yet.",
    "story": [
      "In the mountains of northern Iraq, just 30 miles from the Iranian border, CBS News met Thursday morning with fighters \u2014   many of them women \u2014   from an armed Kurdish Iranian opposition group who say they're poised to take on and help topple the Islamic Republic's hardline clerical rulers.",
      "The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) is banned as a terror group inside Iran and based in exile across the border in Iraq. For years it has trained for the day the Iranian regime can be ousted from power. But as President Trump appears to step back from threats of a U.S. military intervention on behalf of Iran's protesters, the Kurdish group's leader told CBS News that time has not yet come.",
      "President Trump said Wednesday that he'd heard on \"good authority\" that the \"killing in Iran is stopping\" and that there was \"no plan for executions\" in the country following a brutal crackdown to end two weeks of widespread protests. Sources inside Iran have told CBS News the Iranian authorities' crackdown may have killed upwards of 12,000 people, and possibly many more.",
      "His remarks appeared to signal a step back from repeated warnings of an unspecified U.S. intervention to protect protesters, and then a threat on Tuesday to order \"very strong actions\" if Iran hanged protesters.",
      "That may not have been the signal from Washington that the PDKI forces training across the border in Iraq were hoping for.",
      "Commander Sayran Gargoli told CBS News the protests had given them hope that the oppressive regime that came to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution might finally be toppled, but only \"if the people who are demonstrating on the street get international help.\"",
      "PDKI leader Mustafa Hijri has lived in exile for more than four decades, and he's watched as Iran's rulers quash several rounds of major unrest. As the latest protests seem to suffer the same fate, he said he couldn't say for sure whether this uprising might prove pivotal.",
      "\"It depends on if the widespread killing will continue or not. If it continues, for sure the demonstrators will not be able to continue. On the other hand, there are other possible scenarios, like America gets into negotiations with the regime of mullahs and forces them to accept its conditions. In this case, the regime will manage to extend its existence for some time.\"",
      "He said he hoped for a U.S. intervention, and specifically, strikes on Iran that \"hit the centers of suppressing forces who are shooting people on the streets, and their so-called 'justice' institutions that serve the government. We want to see those institutions gone.\"",
      "\"The majority of the people in Iran are unhappy with this regime, and they stand against it,\" Hijri said.",
      "But in the absence of such help from abroad, Hijri told CBS News that sending PDKI forces across the border \u2014   and calling into action the thousands of forces he says the group has lying in wait inside the country \u2014 could backfire dramatically.",
      "\"I believe that it is not in the benefit of the demonstrators at the moment to have armed forces move back in the country, because it becomes a convenient excuse to the regime to kill the people,\" he said. \"This is why we haven't reached the moment to make such a decision. But when the day comes, and we come to a conclusion that the return of our peshmerga [Kurdish] forces will not become additional reason to suppress the demonstrators, then we might do that.\"",
      "Hijri said the PDKI wants Kurds, who form about 10% of Iran's population, and other ethnic minorities to be allowed to live \"under democratic law, and that their children are allowed to learn in their own languages, and that the government officially recognizes\" their right to do so.",
      "The opposition fighters, Hijri said, \"have been trained, and they are there, ready for when the party needs them.\"",
      "But as Iran's hardline leaders increasingly appear to have survived yet another significant challenge to their grip on power, at least for now, the PKDI, and millions of Iranians still inside the country, can only keep waiting.",

    "summary": "Years after the first reports of Havana Syndrome emerged, U.S. officials have obtained and are testing a device\u200b that could be linked to the debilitating condition.",
    "story": [
      "There's a new development in the yearslong international mystery over Havana Syndrome: The U.S. has obtained and has been testing a device that officials believe could be linked to the debilitating condition.",
      "Sources said the device was quietly obtained by the Department of Homeland Security in late 2024, almost a decade after symptoms of what became known as Havana Syndrome were first reported by U.S. embassy personnel in Cuba. The Pentagon has since been testing the portable, backpack-sized device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy and contains components of Russian origin.",
      "The sources said Homeland Security investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome. The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment, and the CIA declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the mysterious illness.",
      "\"My brain is broken\"",
      "The term Havana Syndrome is derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Cuba's capital. After the U.S. embassy opened there in 2015, media outlets started reporting on strange medical symptoms affecting U.S. embassy personnel working in the country: dizziness, fatigue, memory problems and impaired vision. Other symptom include nausea, migraines, head pressure, vertigo and ringing or popping sensations in the ears.",
      "Many people with Havana Syndrome describe hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location, with effects so severe for some that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs.",
      "\"My brain is broken,\" former CIA analyst Erika Stith told CBS News in 2022.",
      "\"We got this as a result of serving our country. And we deserve to be taken care of,\" she said.",
      "The U.S. government refers to the cases as \"anomalous health incidents,\" or AHIs, and officials have not confirmed what caused them.",
      "But \"60 Minutes\" has spoken with experts who believe the incidents involve targeted sonic or microwave attacks.",
      "Many of those affected believe that they were wounded by a secret weapon that fires a high-energy beam of microwaves or ultrasound.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting the government for failing to provide enough support or access to specialized medical care.",
      "Who has been affected?",
      "More than 1,500 U.S. officials have reported experiencing the condition since 2016, including White House staff, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers and their families. Cases have emerged in dozens of countries, and have even been reported in Washington, D.C.",
      "In 2021, a Havana Syndrome-style incident was reported in Vietnam shortly before then-Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0visited Hanoi. The U.S. embassy there said at the time that a \"possible anomalous health incident\" required at least one official to be evacuated for medical care, and it prompted Harris to delay her arrival.",
      "\"60 Minutes\" later learned that 11 people reported being stricken: two officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi and nine others who were part of a Defense Department team preparing for Harris' visit. While Harris was unharmed, some of the injured U.S. personnel were medevac'ed out of Vietnam.",
      "In another case, a State Department security officer who worked in the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, China, told \"60 Minutes\" that he and his wife started having symptoms after hearing bizarre sounds in their apartment in 2017.",
      "The security officer, Mark Lenzi, described the sound as a \"marble\" circling down a \"metal funnel\" and said he heard it four times \u2014 always in the same spot at the same time of day: above his son's crib when he put him to bed at night. He described the sound as \"fairly loud\" and like nothing he'd heard before. He and his wife began to feel ill shortly after hearing the sounds.",
      "Lenzi said he believed he was targeted due to his work using top-secret equipment to analyze electronic threats to diplomatic missions.",
      "\"This was a directed standoff attack against my apartment\u2026it was a weapon,\" he told correspondent Scott Pelley. \"I believe it's RF, radio frequency energy, in the microwave range.\"",
      "Questions about Russia's possible role",
      "\"60 Minutes\" reported in mid-2024 on a major development in the Havana Syndrome investigation: a suspected link between attacks in Tbilisi, Georgia, and a top-secret Russian intelligence unit, as well as evidence that a reliable source called \"a receipt\" for acoustic weapons testing done by the same intelligence unit.",
      "Lt. Col. Greg Edgreen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who led the Pentagon investigation into these incidents, told \"60 Minutes\" at the time that he was confident that Russia was behind these attacks, and that they were part of a worldwide campaign to neutralize U.S. officials.",
      "\"If my mother had seen what I saw, she would say, 'It's the Russians, stupid,'\" Edgreen said.",

      "U.S. assessments",
      "A U.S. intelligence assessment released in 2023 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses \u2014 a conclusion reaffirmed in an updated review released a year ago. That review found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable.",
      "Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "In 2024, the House Intelligence Committee concluded in a report that the 2023 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"lacked analytic integrity and was highly irregular in its formulation.\" The report said it \"appears increasingly likely that a foreign adversary is behind some cases of what officials refer to as \"anomalous health incidents.\"",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence says it has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents and \"remains committed to sharing findings\" with the American public when it's complete.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos said that \"a new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one.\"",
      "Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after he said he was stricken in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",

    "summary": "Iranian shopkeeper Erfan Soltani is among thousands of people who were feared to be facing death sentences, but after a warning from President Trump, officials claim he never was.",
    "story": [
      "Iranian authorities claimed Thursday that 26-year-old shopkeeper Erfan Soltani is not facing execution and could only be sentenced to prison if convicted of the charges he's facing. Soltani's uncertain fate garnered international attention after activists said his family had been told he would be executed for involvement in the anti-government protests that swept across the Islamic Republic in early January.",
      "Human rights group Hengaw, which has been in contact with Soltani's family, told CBS News this week that he had been convicted of participating in the protests\u00a0and sentenced to death, but as the regime in Tehran came under intense pressure from Washington, a Hengaw representative told CBS News on Wednesday night that it had been informed the execution was postponed. The family had been told earlier in the week that Soltani would be executed on Wednesday, according to Hengaw.",
      "On Thursday morning, the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which is associated with Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps, cited the government's Judiciary Media Center as denying that Soltani was ever sentenced to death.",
      "The center dismissed the reports as fabricated and misleading and said Soltani, who was arrested on January 8 during the height of the protests, had been charged with assembly and collusion against national internal security, as well as engaging in propaganda activities against the system. It acknowledged that he was being held at the Karaj Central Prison, outside Tehran, but said the charges against him only carry a possible prison sentence, not execution.",
      "Hengaw, which monitors events in Iran via a network of contacts inside the country, had told CBS News on Wednesday evening that Soltani's execution \"has not been implemented and has been postponed.\"",
      "An ongoing internet blackout in Iran was making it difficult for Hengaw to provide timely updates on the case and for CBS News and other organizations to get a clear picture of the events in the country more broadly.",
      "The uncertainty over Solanti's fate on Wednesday came on the heels of\u00a0President Trump threatening \"strong action\"\u00a0against Iran if it hanged people detained during the protests. Mr. Trump then told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office that he had heard on \"good authority\" that the \"killing in Iran is stopping\" and \"there's no plan for executions.\"",
      "Hengaw representative Awyar Shekhi told CBS News on Tuesday that Iranian officials had informed the family that Soltani \"was arrested because of the protest, but we don't know if actually he participated in the protest because there is absolutely no information about that or evidence.\"",
      "Soltani is a clothing seller whose family lives near Tehran, according to Shekhi, who added that Soltani's family has said he was not a political activist but was opposed to the current situation in the country.",
      "Iranian security forces launched a brutal crackdown to end the widespread anti-government protests, which sources inside the country say may have resulted in the deaths of some 12,000 people, and potentially many more. More than 2,600 people were detained amid the unrest that began on Dec. 28, according to rights groups.",
      "There had been fear that many of those in detention could be executed. On Thursday, Iranian officials had yet to clearly confirm or deny Mr. Trump's statement that there would be no executions.",
      "Shekhi told CBS News that from the time of his detention, Soltani had been \"deprived from all of his basic rights to contact his family, to have a lawyer.\"",
      "Four days later, \"the family got information that their son has received [a death] sentence, and without declaring what was the charges [or] when the trial took place.\"",
      "Soltani's family was not told how his planned execution would be carried out, but the most common method in Iran is hanging, Hengaw told CBS News.",
      "Soltani's sister is a lawyer and was pursuing all available legal avenues to defend her brother, \"but the authorities have told [her] there's no case to review and we are not allowing that,\" Shekhi said earlier this week.",
      "The activist told CBS News the family was informed they'd be allowed to have a final meeting with Soltani \u2014 a procedure normally reserved for the families of those being executed. Hengaw said it had no confirmation that the meeting had taken place, but a source close to the family told the group that some of Soltani's relatives had been heading to the massive Ghezel Hesar prison in Karaj late Tuesday night.",
      "\"If we want to do a job, we should do it now. If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly,\" Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei said Wednesday in a video aired on state television, showing part of a discussion he had with other judiciary officials about the handling of detained protesters' cases. \"If it becomes late, two months, three months later, it doesn't have the same effect. If we want to do something, we have to do that fast.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told CBS News' Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the U.S. would act if the Iranian regime begins hanging protesters.",
      "When asked to clarify what that action could be, Mr. Trump said:\u00a0 \"Well \u2014 let's define it in Venezuela. Let's define it with [ISIS leader] al-Baghdadi. He was wiped out. Let's define it with [Iranian military commander] Soleimani. And let's define it in Iran, where \u2014 (we) wiped out their Iran nuclear threat in a period of about 15 minutes once the B-2s got there. And that was a complete obliteration as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it, and they said, 'You know, Trump was right.' So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people and now you're telling me about hanging - we'll see how that works out for them. It's not gonna work out good.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:38:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Two Republicans switched their votes after pressure from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans killed a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to further strike Venezuela after the White House put pressure on a handful of GOP senators who supported it.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana flipped their support Wednesday after initially voting to advance it. Vice President JD Vance had to step in to break the 50-50 tie.",
      "Republicans used a procedural maneuver to block the measure, arguing that the resolution should no longer be \"privileged\" \u2014 which gives it priority on the floor \u2014 because the U.S. is not currently engaged in \"hostilities\" with Venezuela.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, previewed the argument in floor remarks Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Today, we expect a vote on a resolution to direct the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities in or against Venezuela, even though the U.S. is not currently engaged in hostilities in or against Venezuela,\" Thune said. \"We have no troops on the ground in Venezuela. We're not currently conducting military operations there.\"",
      "Senators\u00a0advanced\u00a0the resolution, introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, last week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife and Mr. Trump asserted the U.S. is now in charge of the country.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure, pushing it forward after two previous failed attempts in the upper chamber to advance similar resolutions to rein in Mr. Trump's military action in the region.",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Hawley, Young, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Murkowski, Collins and Paul voted against the GOP effort to kill the resolution Wednesday.",
      "Kaine said Wednesday night he was disappointed in the outcome but saw it \"as a growing set of cracks\" in the GOP's willingness to stick with Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump quickly lashed out\u00a0at the Republicans, saying they \"should never be elected to office again.\" He again criticized the senators on Tuesday during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, calling them \"real losers.\"",
      "Some of the senators said they received calls from Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of Wednesday's action.",
      "Hawley said Rubio had addressed his concerns about U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "He said Rubio confirmed the U.S. \"has no ground troops currently in Venezuela\" and that if the administration plans to put troops in Venezuela, \"they would abide by the War Powers Act and they would come to Congress for congressional authorization.\"",
      "\"The secretary told me directly that the administration will not put ground troops in Venezuela,\" Hawley said.",
      "Young pushed back on criticism that he caved to pressure from the president, telling reporters that senators had \"secured some valuable reassurances and deliverables\" from the White House on Venezuela.",
      "\"I think we played our hand well,\" Young said, contending that the resolution was heading for a presidential veto if it eventually did make it through both chambers. Both the House and Senate would have needed a two-thirds majority to overcome a veto, which was unlikely.",
      "The switch-up appeared to come as a surprise to Kaine, who said Wednesday morning that he expected all five Republicans to stick with Democrats.",
      "Before Maduro's ouster, lawmakers said they had received insufficient answers from the Trump administration about whether its end goals in Venezuela included regime change, as the U.S. ramped up strikes\u00a0against alleged drug-smuggling boats, imposed an oil blockade and Mr. Trump threatened land strikes.",
      "Republicans who voted last week to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "A day after the initial Senate vote, Mr. Trump announced he had called off a \"second wave\" of attacks against Venezuela, claiming the two countries \"are working well together.\" But, he said, U.S. naval forces in the region would \"stay in place for safety and security purposes.\"",
      "Kaine attributed\u00a0Mr. Trump's decision to cancel more strikes to the war powers vote. CBS News did not receive a response from the White House regarding Kaine's assertion.",
      "Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                      Seiji  Yamashita\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Rubina Aminian was a \"full of life\" 23-year-old Iranian fashion student with big goals for the future. She was shot and killed last week amid the protests, her aunt told CBS News, as she described how Aminian's mother forced her way into a morgue and carried her daughter's body out.",
      "\"I can confidently say that it was the most difficult day of my life,\" Aminian's aunt, Hilala Noori, told CBS News, of the day she learned Aminian had been shot. \"When they confirmed she had been killed, my whole body was burning. I don't know how to describe that moment to you. I've been unable to sleep for more than two hours since Saturday. I feel like a rock is in my throat. I cannot swallow anything.\"",
      "On the evening of Jan. 8, Aminian left her university and joined the large crowds marching in the streets in the capital city. There, her family says she was shot at close range in the back of the head.",
      "When Aminian's family heard the news of her death, they immediately left Kermanshah, where they live, and drove to Tehran to find her body, Noori said.",
      "They found out the location of the morgue where they believed her remains were located and went there to try to find and bring her home.",
      "When they arrived, Noori said her sister, Aminian's mother, described seeing hundreds of bodies all \"lying on top of each other.\" She said: \"The children of people, all of them had been shot in their heads, their necks, directly in their heads. They were all lying on each other, and my sister was forced to see those beautiful faces in order to find our dear Rubina.\"",
      "Noori told CBS News that Aminian's mother searched the bodies outside the facility, but couldn't find Aminian. She was initially not allowed inside the facility, but managed to force her way in.",
      "\"She [was] forced to carry her daughter's body and steal it, because they didn't give her permission to take out the body,\" Noori told CBS News. \"She was forced to carry the body of her 40-kilo daughter and take her outside. She stole the body from them and held it for many hours until they arrived at Kermanshah,\" Noori told CBS News.",
      "Noori said she holds Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran \"directly responsible\" for the death of her niece. \"They are the only ones responsible for it,\" she said.",
      "\"What the Islamic Republic took from her, took from us, was a girl who was full of passion and love for life, and she shared that passion everywhere,\" Noori said. \"She wanted to create her own future. She believed that you should create your own future with your own hands. She didn't wait for anyone to create her own future for her. Because of this, she took to the streets, to gain her freedom. Just like all the young people we've lost on the streets. She was hands-on; she never wanted anyone to do anything for her. She knew what she wanted to do, and she knew how to do it. And I'm really proud of her. I'm proud of her choice, even though it's very painful for me. I will have to live my life with this pain. I might never be the same. But I am proud of her, of her sacrifice, her path. And I hope that her blood has not been spilled in vain.\"",

    "summary": "After the meeting, Denmark's foreign minister said they're eager to work with the U.S. while respecting the \"red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. and Denmark still have \"fundamental\" differences over the future of Greenland, but will continue to talk, Denmark's foreign minister said after a White House meeting Wednesday amid President Trump's push to take over the Arctic island.",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Loekke Rasmussen, met with Greenland's minister for foreign affairs, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Loekke Rasmussen described the meeting as a \"frank but also constructive discussion\" on security long-term security in Greenland.",
      "The Danish official said they've agreed to establish a high-level working group to determine a way forward on Greenland, as Mr. Trump remains intent on acquiring the semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Loekke Rasmussen said they \"still have a fundamental disagreement, but we also agree to disagree.\"",
      "\"There is clearly a disagreement,\" he said in a press conference with reporters in Washington. \"We agree that it makes sense to try to sit down on a high level to explore whether there are possibilities to accommodate the concerns of the president while we at the same time respect the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"Whether that is doable, I don't know,\" Loekke Rasmussen said, adding he hopes they can \"take down the temperature.\" The Danes asked for the meeting.",
      "Loekke Rasmussen said he agrees that the security situation in the Arctic has changed, and said he's \"eager\" to work with the U.S. on security improvements. But the framework for improving Arctic security through NATO already exists, he said, and the U.S. acquiring Greenland is \"absolutely not necessary.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's minister of foreign affairs, told reporters it's never been more important to strengthen their ties with the U.S., \"but that doesn't mean that we want to be owned by the United States.\"",
      "Asked if he would respect the red lines set forth by Greenland and Denmark, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, \"Well, we're going to see what happens with Greenland,\" adding that he hasn't yet been briefed on the meeting.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security, so we're going to see what happens,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked whether he would leave NATO over the Greenland issue, the president said he wouldn't broadcast his options.",
      "The meeting came one day after Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference, \"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, citing national security reasons. He repeated that again on Wednesday morning, saying \"it is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building\" and that \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"",
      "\"IF WE DON'T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\"NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES,\" he said. \"Anything less than that is unacceptable.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that if Greenland's premier said the territory wanted to stay part of Denmark, \"that's their problem.\"",
      "\"I disagree with him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know who he is, don't know anything about him, but that's going to be a big problem for him.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "Vance visited Greenland last year. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the Trump administration is applying \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "Tensions were high ahead of the meeting, as was concern about a further fracturing of the relationship with the U.S. NATO ally, sources familiar with the situation told CBS News. The Danish government expected to present an offer for enhanced cooperation with the U.S. and access in Greenland in terms of military presence and NATO presence, the sources said.",
      "The Danes wanted clarity on what the U.S. is pressing for beyond that offer, and whether a financial plus-up is being demanded, the sources said. They wanted to know if Mr. Trump's intent is to have control or political ownership, which concerns them, given the clear objection of the Greenlandic government to either. Greenlandic officials have been clear that they want the island to belong to Denmark.",
      "A European official from a nearby country said there is some concern that Denmark may be miscalculating by demanding this meeting with the U.S. because it could formalize and potentially harden positions around what could otherwise be rhetorical pressure by Mr. Trump.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky took to the Senate floor to voice his disapproval of intervening in Greenland's affairs and to emphasize the importance of maintaining a united NATO alliance.",
      "\"Unless and until the President can demonstrate otherwise, then the proposition at hand today is very straightforward: incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in U.S. access to the Arctic,\" McConnell said. \"That's allies \u2013 plural. Because this is about more than Greenland. It's about more than America's relationship with its highly capable Nordic allies.

    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 A construction crane fell onto a moving passenger train, causing a fiery derailment that killed at least 30 people Wednesday in northeastern Thailand, authorities said. Another 64 people were injured and rescuers were still searching the wreckage and giving first aid.",
      "The derailment occurred on part of an ambitious planned high-speed rail project that will eventually connect China with much of Southeast Asia.",
      "Anuphong Suksomnit, the governor of Nakhon Ratchasima province, where the accident took place, said four passengers among the 171 believed to have been on board the train were still missing. Searchers were still looking through the wreckage about eight hours after the morning crash.",
      "The crane, which was being used to build an elevated part of the railway, fell as the train was traveling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province, according to the public relations office for Nakhon Ratchasima province, where the accident occurred some 143 miles northeast of Bangkok.",
      "Photos published in Thai media showed plumes of white, then dark smoke above the scene and construction equipment hanging down from between two concrete support pillars.",
      "Rescue workers stood on top of overturned railway carriages, some of them with gaping holes torn on their sides, video from public broadcaster ThaiPBS showed. What appeared to be sections of the crane were scattered along the track.",
      "Thai media reported the train had three carriages, the last two being the most heavily damaged.",
      "Transport Minister Piphat Ratchakitprakan said 195 people were on board the train. He said he ordered an investigation.",
      "Area resident Mitr Intrpanya, 54, told French news agency AFP she \"heard a loud noise, like something sliding down from above, followed by two explosions. When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages. The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half.\"",
      "In August 2024, a railway tunnel on the planned route, also in Nakhon Ratchasima, collapsed, killing three workers. Days of heavy rainfall were believed to have been a factor in the collapse.",
      "The elevated segment that collapsed is a part of the Thai-Chinese high-speed railway project linking Bangkok, Thailand's capital to the northeastern province of Nong Khai, bordering Laos. The two-stage rail project has a total cost of more than 520 billion baht ($16.8 billion) and is associated with an ambitious plan to connect China with Southeast Asia under Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.",
      "Anan Phonimdaeng, acting governor of the State Railway of Thailand, said the project's contractor is Italian-Thai Development, with a Chinese company responsible for design and construction supervision.",
      "He said authorities will examine the responsibilities of both parties, and the Railway Department plans to take legal action against the contractor as a first step. Damage to the train was estimated to be more than 100 million baht ($3.2 million), while construction equipment suffered limited damage, said Anan.",
      "A statement posted on the company's website expressed condolences to the victims and said the company would take responsibility for paying compensation to the families of the dead and hospitalization expenses for the injured.",
      "Anger intensifying",
      "The new accident sparked outrage in Thailand because the main contractor for the route's first stage between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima, Italian-Thai Development, was also directly responsible for construction on the stretch where the accident occurred.",
      "The company, also known as Italthai, was also the co-lead contractor for the State Audit Building in the Thai capital Bangkok, which collapsed during the construction stage in March during an earthquake in neighboring Myanmar.",
      "About 100 people were killed in the collapse, which was the only major structure in Thailand to suffer such serious damage. Dozens of executives were indicted in connection with the disaster but none have yet been tried.",
      "The involvement of Chinese companies in both projects has also drawn attention, as has Italthai's and Chinese companies' involvement in the construction of several expressway extensions in and around Bangkok where several accidents, some fatal, had occurred.",
      "Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who was interior minister when the State Audit Building collapsed, said the Comptroller General's Department and Transport Ministry are responsible for blacklisting contractors, and the laws couldn't be amended in the brief time he was interior minister to expedite the matter.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the government was aware of the reports about the accident and had expressed condolences.",
      "\"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the safety of projects and personnel, and we are also learning about the situation,\" he said. \"At present, it appears that the relevant section is being constructed by a Thai company, and the cause of the accident is still under investigation.\"",

    "summary": "Experts tell CBS News what sort of options President Trump has to respond to Iran's brutal crackdown on protesters.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has warned of \"very strong action\" against Iran if it hangs accused anti-government protesters, and he told its people that U.S. \"help is on its way\" as CBS News learned that the crackdown to quash the unrest may have killed upwards of 12,000 people.",
      "While the administration has made it clear that Mr. Trump will have a number of options at his disposal, from conventional strikes by the U.S. military to cyberwarfare, the White House has given no hint as to what the president will do. In the meantime, the U.S. government does appear to be bracing for possible retaliation by Tehran.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued a security alert on Wednesday urging U.S. citizens to \"leave Iran now,\" or to keep a low profile and ensure adequate supplies of food, water and medications if remaining in the country. The new advisory added to an existing Level 4 travel alert\u00a0\u2014   the highest issued by the State Department, that was put in place in early December, warning Americans not to visit Iran due to the risks of terrorism, civil unrest and wrongful detention.",
      "The Pentagon, meanwhile, has ordered a reduction of personnel at the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East \u2014 Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, just across the Persian Gulf from Iran \u2014   as a \"precautionary measure,\" a U.S. official told CBS News national security correspondent Charlie D'Agata.",
      "While Mr. Trump's next move on Iran remained unclear after a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, military officials told CBS News the White House was keeping all options on the table, including military, technological and psychological options. Below is a more detailed look at what some of those options could actually involve, and how they might be perceived in the region.",
      "Military strikes",
      "If Mr. Trump decides to order U.S. military action against Iran's military and security forces, the Islamic Republic's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would likely be among the top targets, according to Alex Vatanka, Iran director of the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C.",
      "Vatanka told CBS News the IRGC, along with its feared \"Basij\" volunteer paramilitary units, \"are essentially the brains and the muscle behind\" any crackdown launched by the regime.",
      "\"If you can target those, whether it's through kinetic actions, offensive cyber capabilities, psychological warfare against them \u2026 that is important,\" Vatanka said, adding that Mr. Trump would be \"sending a clear message\" with such a move.",
      "Iran's regular army may be a less likely U.S. target, Vatanka said, because it is composed largely of conscripted young men who join and serve for two years, and thus may be less loyal to the regime overall.",
      "The IRGC, however, operates differently, as a parallel religious force under the direct control of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Created specifically to protect the Islamic Republic system that came to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the IRGC has at least one major base in every one of Iran's 31 provinces, two in Tehran, and tens of thousands of smaller bases nationwide.",
      "If the U.S. military does strike Iran, Vatanka says President Trump's real priorities may be revealed by the choice of targets. If it is military sites or Iran's nuclear facilities, which the U.S. already attacked in \"Operation Midnight Hammer\" in June, he said it would come across as a show of support for one of the Trump administration's closest regional allies, rather than for the Iranian people..",
      "\"That's helping the United States, maybe in terms of its strategic aims or friends like Israel. It's not helping the protest movements,\" said Vatanka. \"People will be looking at it cynically, saying he's taking advantage of the moment of chaos in Iran to advance goals that might be good goals for the United States, but certainly it's not what he's promising the protest movement.\"",
      "Going for the top: Targeting the ayatollah",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei could also find himself in the sights of the U.S. military.",
      "The top leaders of Iran's proxy groups Hamas and Hezbollah have already been assassinated in recent years, and\u00a0 Khamenei \"could very well be a target,\" according to Bilal Saab, a Middle East political and security expert and the Senior Managing Director of the TRENDS Research & Advisory organization in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"If you believe in that decapitation strategy, it might be the best way forward that you take this man out. And remember, he's been there since 1989. So, for 37 years, this man has been the brains behind what Iran has done in the region, at home and abroad. And if you take him out, you might bring about the conditions where Iran either has a political transformation to a different political system, or whatever is left after Khamenei in terms of leaders.\"",
      "If the White House pursued this course of action, it would track with the U.S. capture of Venezuela's former President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. While Maduro's former vice-president Delcy Rodriguez was quickly sworn as acting president, Mr. Trump has declared the U.S. \"in charge\" of Venezuela.",
      "Maduro, however, had already been indicted on federal criminal charges in the U.S. when he was captured, and he was arraigned just a couple days later in a court in New York.",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. government and accused of a litany of nefarious actions across the Middle East, but he has not been charged with any crimes by American courts.",
      "Cyber and psychological warfare",
      "Beyond bombs and military strikes, the White House is also weighing cyberattack options, U.S. officials say.",
      "\"You go after command and control nodes and try to disrupt the ability of the Iranian security personnel to communicate amongst themselves,\" Saab said of the likely objective of such operations. \"This is the typical classic target when you think about cyber operations, and then maybe also try to distract the communication between leadership \u2014   political leadership \u2014   and, of course, their lieutenants on the ground.",
      "This would be using the psychological weapon of fear, Saab told CBS News.",
      "\"You're trying to influence the calculus of loyalists, of people serving the regime, right? And this is the typical dynamic of offering them negative and positive incentives. Positive being, you defect, then you can have some kind of a political future, or at least we won't kill you. Negative is precisely that, all sorts of punishment, ranging from elimination to irrelevance, to going after their property and going after everything that they hold dear to them.\"",
      "And President Trump's own way of doing things \u2014   whether on purpose or by accident \u2014   may be keeping the Iranian regime wondering.",
      "As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday: \"Nobody knows what President Trump is going to do except for President Trump.\"",
      "\"They don't know which way he's going to go,\" said Saab, \"and that's all part of psychological warfare.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Iranian regime has gone on the offensive, threatening anyone who supported the recent protests in any way \u2014 after a crackdown that sources tell CBS News may have killed some 12,000 people, and possibly many more. Thousands of people were arrested and are now facing possible death sentences for taking part in the demonstrations.",
      "The post-protest reprisals are meant to frighten people into silence. They include going after businesses, money and financial assets connected to anyone seen as having backed the anti-regime demonstrations.",
      "Mohammad Saedinia is one particularly high-profile example.",
      "He is famous in Iran as the owner of a chain of candy shops and buzzing cafes beloved by residents in the capital Tehran, especially young liberals. He also established a popular shopping mall near the holy city of Qom.",
      "The regional justice department in Qom announced Wednesday that Saedinia had been arrested, accusing him of \"calling on the people to riot and cause chaos.\"",
      "Saedinia's only crime appears to have been closing his cafes at the very outset of the protests in late December, and to make it clear in a social media post that it was in solidarity with business people \u2014   including many stall holders from Tehran's main bazaar \u2014   who closed their shops to express their anger over a catastrophic plunge in the value of Iran's currency.",
      "Those demonstrations against economic hardship and the regime's appalling financial record snowballed quickly into the nationwide protests against the Islamic Republic's leadership itself.",
      "Tasnim, a semi-official news agency associated with the country's powerful Revolutionary Guards, said Wednesday that Saedinia's operating licenses and operating permits had been cancelled and his businesses shut down.",
      "Tasnim also quoted Iran's Attorney General Mohammad Movahedi Azad as saying that officials from the country's judiciary were \"obliged to identify the property of the 'terrorists' and report it to the prosecutors.\"",
      "It is a powerful warning to all businesses in the country that they should open their doors for trade as normal \u2014   and shut up about the last two weeks of unrest.",
      "The financial threat extends beyond Iran's business community.\u00a0 The attorney general, who like other Iranian officials refers to protesters as \"terrorists,\" is demanding the seizure of property belonging to anyone linked to the demonstrations, to \"teach them a lesson.\"",
      "President Trump's threat to take some as yet unspecified action against the regime is hanging over the leadership. On the one hand, they've responded by threatening reprisals against U.S. military installations in the region. On the other hand, they are seeking this week to show they're moving on from the unrest.",
      "A pro-regime source inside Iran told CBS News on Wednesday that the regime's public position \u2014 repeated on state television \u2014   is that the protests were an attempt by the U.S. and Israel to topple the government, \"which badly failed.\"",

      "The Al Udeid airbase in Doha, Qatar, is the forward operating headquarters for U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces across the Middle East. The reduction comes as Iran has already threatened to retaliate against any U.S. military action by targeting U.S. troops.",

Such measures could include cyber and psychological operations that could occur simultaneously with traditional military force.",

      "Reuters first reported the U.S. military was reducing its presence at the base.",
      "The military similarly withdrew personnel at Al Udeid last summer around the time of the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities. Following that bombing, coined Operation Midnight Hammer, Iran retaliated by targeting Al Udeid with about a dozen ballistic missiles. Nearly all of the missiles were intercepted and no one was hurt in the attack, partly because of the reduction of troops.",
      "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine in a press conference following the attack last June said the U.S. military had reduced to \"a minimum force posture\" across the region, including Al Udeid. Most personnel had moved off the base, leaving only a handful of soldiers.",

      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with demonstrations in at least 185 cities around the country. An internet blackout impeded communications and made it difficult to know the scope of the protests \u2014 or the crackdown that appeared to be escalating.",

Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",

      "CBS News has verified that video posted online shows the bodies of at least 366 and likely more than 400 people killed amid the protest piled up at a morgue in a Tehran suburb. The video appears to show forensic personnel documenting gruesome injuries on the bodies, and crowds of people seemingly trying to identify the dead.",
      "The injuries visible are extensive and include gunshot wounds, \"birdshot\" shotgun wounds, gashes and other severe injuries.",

      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",

      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi \u2014 whose father, the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power \u2014 has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The device was purchased by Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration and cost millions, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government quietly acquired a device in late 2024 that officials believe may be connected to the debilitating condition known as Havana Syndrome, which more than 1,500 American officials have reported experiencing since 2016, according to multiple sources briefed on the matter who spoke with CBS News.",
      "The device was purchased clandestinely in the final weeks of the Biden administration by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations division, using Pentagon funding that exceeded eight figures, according to two people familiar with the matter. The device is portable, backpack-sized, and contains components of Russian origin, the two people said.",
      "Three of the people said the Pentagon has been testing the device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy, for more than a year, but did not offer details on the nature of the tests. They said the department's investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome,\u00a0a term derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. U.S. officials briefed some of their findings to congressional oversight committees last year.",
      "Details about the U.S. acquisition of the device were reported by independent journalist Sasha Ingber and CNN.",
      "The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Victims have reported a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including severe headaches and head pressure, vertigo, nausea, and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many have described hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location. For some, the effects were so severe that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs. Reports of cases have emerged from every populated continent, spanning dozens of countries, and involving diplomats, intelligence officers, and military personnel.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting their government employers for failing to provide meaningful support or access to specialized medical care. In the absence of official recognition, some resorted to paying out of pocket for expensive diagnoses and treatments, and have described a sense of isolation and marginalization as their condition went unacknowledged.",
      "An initial U.S. intelligence assessment completed in 2023 concluded it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses, which the Biden administration formally labeled \"Anomalous Health Incidents,\" or AHIs. That conclusion was reaffirmed in an updated review released in January 2025, which found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents. Three people familiar with the review told CBS News it is largely complete, but said it has not yet been briefed to lawmakers or prepared for public release.",
      "An ODNI spokesperson said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \"remains committed to sharing findings from her investigation into Anomalous Health Incidents with the American people.\"",
      "\"However, we are not going to rush to put out incomplete information,\" the spokesperson said, noting a team was continuing \"relentless\" work on completing the assessment.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after being struck in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",
      "\"A new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one,\" he said.",

    "summary": "British public broadcaster BBC wants a Florida court to throw out Trump's lawsuit, with lawyers arguing a lack of jurisdiction.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, will file a motion to dismiss a $10 billion lawsuit brought by President Trump over a 2024 documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech together, according to a document filed with the court on Monday. The BBC argues that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that Mr. Trump's attorneys are wrong to claim he suffered damages due to the documentary.",
      "The suit, filed last month by Mr. Trump's legal team in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team is seeking $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion, court filings reviewed by CBS News show.",
      "The 33-page complaint filed by Mr. Trump's attorneys in December accuses the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a documentary for the BBC's \"Panorama\" program, which was broadcast in the U.K. a week before the 2024 U.S. election.",
      "One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in the same address. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "In the latest court documents released Monday, the BBC's legal team said it will argue that the Florida court should dismiss the suit because the \"defamation case arises out of a documentary that Defendants the British Broadcasting Corporation (\"the BBC\"), BBC Studios Distribution Ltd., and BBC Studios Productions Ltd. did not create in Florida, produce in Florida, or air in Florida.\"",
      "Attorneys for the BBC will also argue that the case did not cause damage to or defame Mr. Trump, noting the fact that he was re-elected after the documentary was broadcast in Britain, and that Mr. Trump won the state of Florida decisively.",
      "The BBC's legal team also argues that a claim made in Mr. Trump's suit, alleging that the documentary was made available in the U.S. via a streaming service, is inaccurate.",
      "\"Plaintiff alleges that the Documentary was available in the U.S. on the streaming service BritBox. But simply clicking on the link that Plaintiff cites for this point shows it is not on BritBox. Nor was it ever available on BritBox,\" according to the filing submitted by law firm Ballard Spahr, which is representing the BBC.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team has not provided evidence that the documentary was created \"with actual malice,\" Ballard Spahr said Monday.",
      "\"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings,\" a BBC spokesperson told CBS News on Tuesday when asked about the organization's move to have the suit dismissed.",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team said in a statement: \"The BBC is liable to President Trump for intentionally and maliciously defaming him by distorting and manipulating his speech. No amount of attempted legal maneuvers can change that fact. President Trump will continue to hold accountable the BBC and all those who traffic in fake news.\"",
      "The BBC formally apologized to Mr. Trump in November, saying in a statement that the edited soundbite in the Panorama documentary had given, \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the BBC's legal team said at the time, adding that it had \"no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",

      "The 'Sunday Night in America' panel breaks down the legal battle over President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Supreme Court is poised to rule soon on President Donald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency wartime law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. countries, which brought key questions over the \"major questions doctrine (MQD),\" or the limiting principle by which courts can, in certain circumstances, move to curb the power of executive agencies.",
      "During oral arguments over Trump's tariffs in November, justices honed in on the so-called major questions doctrine, which allows courts to limit the power of executive agencies on actions with \"vast economic and political significance,\" and how it squares with Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact his sweeping global and reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Plaintiffs told the court Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to unilaterally impose his steep import duties violates the major questions doctrine, since IEEPA does not explicitly mention the word \"tariffs.\" Rather, it authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" during a declared national emergency, the plaintiffs noted, arguing it falls short of the standard needed to pass muster for MQD.",
      "\"Congress does not (and could not) use such vague terminology to grant the executive virtually unconstrained taxing power of such staggering economic effect \u2014 literally trillions of dollars \u2014 shouldered by American businesses and consumers,\" they told the court in an earlier briefing.",

      "\"Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,\" he added. \"A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.\"",
      "While U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged to the justices that IEEPA does not explicitly give an executive the power to regulate tariffs, he stressed in November that the power to tariff is \"the natural commonsense inference\" of IEEPA.",
      "But whether the high court will back his argument remains to be seen.",
      "That was the conclusion reached by the U.S. Court of International Trade last year. Judges on the three-judge panel voted unanimously to block Trump's tariffs from taking force, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law.",
      "\"The parties cite two doctrines \u2014 the nondelegation doctrine and the major questions doctrine \u2014 that the judiciary has developed to ensure that the branches do not impermissibly abdicate their respective constitutionally vested powers,\" the court said in its ruling.",
      "The doctrine was also a focus in November, as justices pressed lawyers for the administration over IEEPA's applicability to tariffs, or taxation powers, and asked the administration what guardrails, if any, exist to limit the whims of the executive branch, should they ultimately rule in Trump\u2019s favor.",
      "Though it's not clear how much the court will rely on the MQD in its ruling, legal experts told Fox News Digital they would expect it to potentially be cited by the Supreme Court if it blocks Trump's tariff regime.",

      "Still, if oral arguments were any indication, the justices seemed poised to block Trump's use of IEEPA to continue his steep tariff plan.",

      "Panelists Jonathan Turley, John Yoo and Kerri Urbahn join \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom\u2019 to discuss the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark hearings that could shape rules for transgender athletes nationwide.",
      "The Supreme Court this week heard arguments in a landmark pair of cases regarding the future of women\u2019s sports, but the real drama lies in whether the court will choose to answer an increasingly controversial question: What is a woman?",
      "The arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J. lasted an unusually long time \u2014 more than three hours \u2014 with tough questioning from the justices to both sides that mostly focused on highly technical legal standards.",
      "The national context, however, is simple. There has been a surge of biological boys identifying as transgender girls participating in girls sports across the country. The result? Girls and women are losing athletic competitions, losing scholarship opportunities and sometimes even sustaining physical injury from their physically stronger male counterparts.",
      "A recent United Nations report summed it up. As of August 2024, \"over 600 female athletes in more than 400 competitions [worldwide] have lost more than 890 medals in 29 different sports\" to \"males who identify as women.\" As a result, more than half of the states in the country have passed laws protecting women\u2019s sports by keeping participation separated by sex.",
      "RILEY GAINES SLAMS DEMS AS SCOTUS SET TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON WOMEN'S SPORTS CASES",
      "Protesters gather outside the Supreme Court as it hears arguments over state laws barring transgender girls and women from playing on school athletic teams Jan. 13, 2026, in Washington. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)",
      "On Tuesday, there were two questions before the court.",
      "In the Idaho case, it was, \"Do laws that seek to protect women's and girls' sports by limiting participation to women and girls based on sex violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\" In the West Virginia case, there was a similar first question and the addition of another: \"Does Title IX prevent a state from consistently designating girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 sports teams based on biological sex determined at birth?\"",
      "In 2020,\u00a0Idaho became the first state in the nation to pass a law protecting women\u2019s sports, Fairness in Women\u2019s Sports. The law preserves women\u2019s sports in public schools \u2014 elementary through college \u2014 by linking participation on an athletic team to biological sex. Lindsay Hecox, a biological male athlete identifying as a transgender woman who wanted to try out for the Boise State University women\u2019s track and cross-country teams, sued, arguing it was unconstitutional.",
      "The 9th Circuit barred Idaho from enforcing the law. Subsequently, in the lead-up to the Supreme Court case, the transgender athlete attempted to have the lower court dismiss the case entirely, but the court rejected the request.",
      "In 2023, West Virginia also passed a law protecting female sports teams by keeping them biologically sex-specific, called Save Women\u2019s Sports.\u00a0Before the law took effect, B.P.J., then an 11-year-old biological male who identifies as female, sued, and the law was paused as it was litigated.",
      "West Virginia alleges that B.P.J. eventually went on to beat and displace female competitors in cross-country and track and field events and that five female athletes refused to compete against the athlete. Lainey Armistead, a former West Virginia State University female soccer player, intervened in the lawsuit to help defend the state\u2019s law. The 4th Circuit ultimately blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law.",
      "REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS URGE JUSTICES TO DEFEND WOMEN'S SPORTS AS SUPREME COURT HEARS KEY CASE",
      "Protesters gather outside the Supreme Court as it hears arguments over state laws barring transgender girls and women from playing on school athletic teams Jan. 13, 2026, in Washington. (Jose Luis Magana/AP)",
      "The bulk of the arguments in the Idaho case focused on whether Idaho\u2019s law classifies on the basis of sex or status. The state argued that the law classified on the basis of biological sex, treating boys and girls equally by permissibly separating them in sports for fairness and safety reasons. The opposing side argued status, that the law impermissibly excluded boys who identify as transgender girls from participating in sports for discriminatory reasons, thereby warranting a higher level of scrutiny from the court.",
      "If that sounds confusing, it\u2019s because it is. On classifications, Justice Samuel Alito asked the ACLU attorney representing the West Virginia transgender athlete a question.",
      "\"You argue this is a status-based classification that targets transgender individuals,\" Alito said. \"But if a state law treats all biological males the same \u2014 meaning no biological male can play on the girls team \u2014 and it treats all biological females the same, how is that a status-based classification?\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who notably refused to define what a woman was under questioning from Sen. Marsha Blackburn,\u00a0R-Tenn., during her confirmation hearing, was sympathetic to the status argument and pushed for a case-by-case analysis where schools could create exceptions for boys who identified as girls but who did not pose an unfair advantage by having the transgender student medically prove they were not at an advantage. The transgender athletes in both cases had taken hormones, and the one in the West Virginia case had taken puberty blockers; the states argued the drugs do not undo the physical advantages that are natural to biology.",
      "Initially, Justice Neil Gorsuch also seemed sympathetic to the arguments from the transgender athletes, which was unsurprising given a 6-3 decision he authored in 2020 that found \"sex\" within Title VII\u2019s prohibition against employment discrimination \"because of sex\" includes transgender individuals despite the law not mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "But later in the Title IX arguments, Gorsuch suggested that sports and the history of Title IX made it different.",
      "\"Javits [Amendment] changed Title IX, and it said, you know, sports are different,\" he said. \"And we've got these regulations that have been out there for 50-plus years. \u2026 Why doesn't that make this case very different than Title VII?\"",

      "Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)",
      "Cutting through the hyper-technical discussions about classifications, Alito asked, \"How can a court determine whether there is discrimination on the basis of sex without knowing what 'sex' means for equal protection purposes?\"",
      "Early on, the attorney for the transgender athlete in the Idaho case also raised the issue of mootness, reminding the justices his client had asked for the case to be dismissed. Justice Sonya Sotomayor appeared to be interested in this argument, but, notably, little time was spent on it overall.",
      "The second round of arguments in the West Virginia case focused on Title IX.",
      "Title IX, passed in 1972, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational settings. The law was considered a game changer for female athletes in that it ensured equal access to the same opportunities as their male counterparts.",
      "West Virginia argued that Title IX did not prohibit its law protecting women\u2019s sports because the law is consistent with the purpose of Title IX, which is treating biological boys and girls equally under the law. Boys are permitted to participate on boys teams and vice versa. The transgender athlete argued that the sports law violated Title IX because it discriminated against the athlete due to the sex the athlete identified as.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts staked out his position clearly in the Title IX arguments, saying, \"You are asking us to find discrimination, but you are also urging us not to define the very word \u2014 'sex' \u2014 that the statute is built upon. I don't see how we can do that.",
      "\"If Title IX is to be administered fairly across thousands of schools, 'sex' must mean something specific and objective.\"",
      "Alito echoed that sentiment throughout the arguments, saying, at one point, \"I think the purpose of the teams is to control for the variable of sex-based advantages, so that talented women athletes have all the same opportunities as talented male athletes.\u00a0If we move away from biological sex, do we not undermine the very protection for women that Title IX was created to ensure?\"",

      "Today, experts say China is applying that same playbook to a far more strategic domain: space.",
      "Across Africa, Latin America and other parts of the Global South, Chinese firms have quietly built or expanded satellite ground stations, tracking facilities and space infrastructure that position Beijing as a gateway to orbit for countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Venezuela, Argentina and Namibia, which lack the resources to get there on their own. Analysts warn the effort carries implications not just for economic influence, but for future warfare and global dominance.",
      "A new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) finds that China is embedding itself deeply into the space programs of dozens of countries, offering end-to-end services that include satellite design, manufacturing, launches, training and ground infrastructure \u2014 a strategy that could give Beijing long-term leverage over a domain increasingly critical to modern military power.",

Similar Chinese-built or Chinese-operated sites have appeared in Egypt and Namibia, where large satellite dishes, tracking antennas and testing complexes support space missions that can serve both civilian and military purposes.",
      "Together, the facilities form part of a growing global network strengthening China\u2019s ability to track, communicate with and potentially influence activity in space \u2014 now widely viewed by defense planners as a new frontier of conflict.",
      "\"This is really about who\u2019s winning the space diplomacy race in the Global South,\" said Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow at CSIS and one of the report\u2019s authors. \"Space is becoming central to economic power, national security, and military capability, and China is positioning itself accordingly.\"",
      "Once dominated by science and commerce, space is now treated as a warfighting domain alongside land, sea, air and cyberspace. Satellites underpin modern military operations, enabling communications, intelligence collection, missile warning, navigation and targeting.",
      "Experts say China cannot operate a truly global space power from within its own borders alone. Satellites require constant tracking and communication, which is only possible through a worldwide network of ground stations spread across multiple continents.",
      "By building facilities overseas, China is closing gaps in its own network and adding redundancy that would be critical in a crisis.",
      "\"Chinese-built ground stations can absolutely support civil and scientific missions \u2014 and they do,\" Funaiole said. \"But they also provide China with the ability to level up its own national security capabilities.\"",
      "Image of a Chinese-built satellite station in Windhoek, Namibia.\u00a0 (CSIS/Hidden Reach/Vantor 2026)",
      "The report raises particular concern about the dual-use nature of the infrastructure China is exporting. Facilities marketed as scientific or commercial assets also can be used to monitor military satellites, communicate with defense systems, and collect sensitive data \u2014 capabilities closely tied to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army.",
      "Compounding those concerns is a lack of transparency over who ultimately controls the data flowing through these systems.",
      "\"When you\u2019re dealing with space technology in China, there\u2019s always a question of who has access and what the data is being used for,\" Funaiole said. \"That lack of transparency is a real issue.\"",
      "Instead of ports and highways, experts say Beijing is now exporting satellites, launch services and ground stations \u2014 offering countries a turnkey path to space while embedding Chinese technology, standards and companies deep inside critical national systems. It is, in effect, Belt and Road applied to orbit.",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of interest across Africa and Latin America in gaining access to space,\" Funaiole said. \"Many countries just don\u2019t have the capabilities to do it on their own, and China has stepped into that gap in a way the United States largely hasn\u2019t.\"",

      "The United States, by contrast, built its global space network decades ago primarily for warfighting and allied defense, relying on facilities in close partner nations rather than developing countries. Washington never packaged space access as a diplomatic tool, leaving a gap China is now exploiting.",
      "While Africa has emerged as a hub for China\u2019s newest physical infrastructure, the report finds some of Beijing\u2019s deepest space partnerships are in Latin America, including Venezuela and Argentina \u2014 developments with direct implications for U.S. security interests closer to home.",
      "That expansion has not gone unnoticed in Washington.",
      "On display during the most recent operation to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, President Donald Trump explicitly revived what he dubbed the \"Donroe Doctrine,\" a modernized and more confrontational take on the Monroe Doctrine that asserted the United States\u2019 right to push hostile foreign powers out of the Western Hemisphere.",

      "Beyond security concerns, the report warns of economic consequences if China becomes the space partner of choice for the developing world. The global space economy is projected to reach trillions of dollars in the coming decades, and long-term partnerships forged today could determine who dominates that market tomorrow.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Kodiak AI, a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous driving technology, has spent years quietly proving that self-driving trucks can work in the real world. The company's core system, the Kodiak Driver, brings software and hardware together in a practical way. As the company explains, \"The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-driven software with modular, vehicle-agnostic hardware into a single, unified platform.\"",
      "That approach matters because trucking is not a closed lab environment. It is highways, weather, fatigue and long hours. Kodiak's strategy focuses on solving those realities first.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How public views on autonomous trucks are changing",
      "During a recent episode of CyberGuy's \"Beyond Connected\" podcast, Kurt spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "Autonomous trucks are already hauling freight on public highways as companies test how the technology performs in real-world conditions. (Kodiak)",
      "Goff described how different the reaction was when the company first launched. \"Kodiak was founded in 2018, and I joined in 2019. When I first started at the company, I said I worked for a company that was working to build trucks that drive themselves, and people kind of looked at me like I was crazy. Over the last few years, we've really seen autonomous vehicles capture the public's imagination. We've seen them grow in the real world. I think that people are getting more used to this idea.\"",
      "For Goff, that shift has come from seeing the technology operate safely outside of test environments, where performance matters more than hype.",
      "Why autonomous trucks could improve road safety",
      "One of Kodiak AI's central arguments is simple. Machines avoid many of the risks that come with human driving. \"We think there are advantages to this technology that humans, myself included, can't match. You know this technology doesn't get distracted. It doesn't check its phone. It doesn't have a phone. It doesn't have a bad day to take it out on the road. It doesn't speed. It doesn't know how to speed. You know they're pretty boring drivers.\" In trucking, boring is often a good thing.",
      "Where autonomous trucks are already operating today",
      "Kodiak AI is already doing this on real roads. The company has been running active freight routes for years, not just testing in controlled settings. \"Kodiak's headquarters are in Mountainview, California, but since 2019, we've had a command center in Lancaster, Texas, which is just south of Dallas. Since 2019, we've actually been delivering freight from that Lancaster hub to Houston, Oklahoma City and Atlanta with what we call a safety driver behind the wheel.\"",
      "Those real-world miles have helped Kodiak fine-tune its system in everyday traffic, weather and long-haul conditions.",
      "Tractor trailers at the entrance of the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on Oct. 8, 2024. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)",
      "The trucking problem Kodiak is trying to solve",
      "Long-haul trucking is essential to the U.S. economy, but it is also one of the most demanding and risky jobs on the road. Drivers spend long stretches away from home, work extended hours and operate heavy vehicles in all conditions. As Goff put it, \"Driving a truck is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs that people do in the United States every day. You know, being a truck driver means, for at least a long-haul truck driver, means you're away from your family for sometimes days, weeks, even months at a time, sleeping in the back of the truck.\"",
      "He also pointed to federal safety rules that limit how long drivers can stay behind the wheel, which are meant to reduce fatigue but also restrict how much freight one person can move in a day. \"If you're driving the 11-hour legal maximum per day and there are people who love being long-haul truckers, but we\u2019re not seeing people stepping up for those roles anymore in this country, and drivers are retiring every year.\"",
      "Those realities have contributed to ongoing driver shortages and growing pressure on the freight system. Kodiak believes autonomous technology is best used where the job is hardest and most repetitive. \"The goal for this technology is really best suited for those really tough jobs. The long lonely highway miles, the trucking and remote locations where people either don't wanna live or don't or can't easily live.\"",
      "Goff also highlighted how much capacity is lost simply because trucks sit idle for most of the day. \"The average truck is driven about seven hours a day in the U.S., and you know there are 24 hours a day, so that's a lot of time just sitting there.\"",
      "Autonomy, he said, could help change that math. \"The goal of the technology is that you can basically run 24/7, just kind of stopping to refuel, to inspect the truck for safety, and you know, other than that, the trucks are moving.\"",
      "Long-haul trucking is one of the most demanding jobs on the road, which is why autonomous systems focus on long, repetitive highway routes. (Kodiak)",
      "How many miles Kodiak AI has driven to prove safety",
      "Kodiak AI emphasizes data over promises. \"We've driven over 3 million miles with a safety driver behind the wheel for most of those miles, meaning somebody ready to take over at any time. So, we got a very good track record.\" To put that into perspective, Goff added, \"The average American drives about 800,000 miles in their lifetime, which seems crazy. That's a lot of driving, but we're at almost four average lifetimes with our system today, and we also use computer simulation, all sorts of things to assess the safety of the system.\"",
      "In addition to its long-haul operations, Kodiak AI works with Atlas Energy Solutions, which does oil logistics in the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. As of Q3 2025, the company has delivered 10 driverless trucks to Atlas, which autonomously deliver sand up to 24 hours a day with no human operator in the cab. Goff says, \"We see our work in the Permian as a perfect sandbox for our long-haul operations.\"",
      "The company has also sought third-party validation. \"Additionally, we have done external-facing studies. We did a study with a company called Nauto, which is one of the leaders in AI-enabled dashcams. They actually help vehicle fleets compute safety scores from an outside perspective. Our system scored the highest ever in the Nauto safety score.\"",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Where autonomous truck regulations stand today",
      "Policy is another key factor in adoption. \"From a regulatory perspective. 25 states have passed laws allowing autonomous vehicle deployment.\" Goff believes the danger of everyday driving makes the case clear. \"I think people who think about transportation every day understand how dangerous driving a car is, driving a truck is, and just being on the road see the potential for this technology.\"",
      "What critics say about autonomous trucks",
      "Autonomous trucking still raises concerns among safety advocates and everyday drivers. Critics question whether software can respond fast enough in emergencies, handle unpredictable human behavior or make judgment calls during complex highway situations.",
      "Kodiak AI says those concerns are exactly why safety comes first. As Goff explained, \"In this industry in particular, we really understand how important it is to be safe.\"",
      "The company argues that autonomous systems must earn trust over time through real-world performance, transparent testing and measurable results, not promises or hype.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday drivers, autonomous trucks raise understandable questions. Sharing the road with a vehicle controlled by software can feel unsettling, especially when headlines often focus on what could go wrong. Kodiak's argument is that safety improves when fatigue, distraction and emotional decision-making are removed from long highway driving. If the technology continues to perform as claimed, the impact could show up in quieter ways. That includes fewer tired drivers on overnight routes, more predictable freight movement and potentially safer highways over time. For consumers, it could also mean fewer delivery delays and less strain on a trucking system already short on drivers.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking is not a future concept anymore. Kodiak AI is already moving freight and collecting real safety data on public roads. At the same time, skepticism remains healthy and necessary. Trust in this technology will rise or fall based on transparency, regulation and long-term performance, not promises. The real question is no longer whether self-driving trucks can operate. It is whether they can consistently prove they make roads safer for everyone who shares them.",

      "FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM ARE USING YOUR DATA TO TRAIN AI: LEARN HOW TO PROTECT IT",
      "Unexpected Instagram password reset emails can look completely legitimate, which is why so many users are caught off guard during this surge. (Cyverguy.com)",
      "Why Instagram password reset emails are surging",
      "This surge is happening because the reset emails themselves can be real, even when the intent behind them is not. Instead of building fake phishing pages or using malware, attackers take advantage of Instagram's normal account recovery system.",
      "The process is simple. An attacker enters your username or email into Instagram's real password reset form. Instagram automatically sends a legitimate reset email to you. The attacker then waits to see how you react.",
      "At this point, your account has not been hacked. The risk comes from what happens next. Attackers are counting on common mistakes, such as clicking the reset button and rushing through the process, reusing a weak password, getting redirected to a fake follow-up page or falling for a second scam email that arrives soon after.",
      "That is why this tactic works as a stress test. It creates urgency and pressure, even though nothing has been compromised yet.",
      "Why attackers love this tactic",
      "This is classic social engineering. The attacker does not need to outsmart Instagram. They need to outsmart you in a stressed moment. A reset email creates urgency. It also feels official. That combination leads people to click first and think second, which is exactly the outcome attackers want. You can treat these surprise reset emails as an early warning system. If you get one:",

      "Your account could be on a target list from a leak or scrape",
      "Your current security setup will decide whether this stays annoying or turns into a takeover",
      "If an email pressures you to act immediately, threatens account deletion or asks for extra information, treat it as suspicious.",
      "The BreachForums leak connection",
      "The timing of this surge has raised fresh concerns. Reports point to data tied to roughly 17.5 million Instagram accounts being shared on BreachForums, an underground forum where cybercriminals trade and discuss stolen data. The alleged post appeared in early January 2026, which lines up with when many users began reporting a sudden wave of password reset emails, sometimes receiving several in a short period of time.",
      "This timing alone does not prove a direct connection. However, leaked usernames or email addresses can make it much easier for attackers to target large numbers of accounts at once, which is exactly what this kind of reset spam depends on. We reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "We reached out to Meta for comment, and a spokesperson for the company told CyberGuy, \"We fixed an issue that allowed an external party to request password reset emails for some Instagram users. We want to reassure everyone there was no breach of our systems and people's Instagram accounts remain secure. People can disregard these emails and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\"",
      "How to tell if the reset email is legitimate",
      "A legitimate Instagram reset email can still be part of an attack attempt. So your goal is not \"confirm it is real,\" it is \"avoid reacting in a risky way.\" Instagram's own guidance boils down to this:",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromisedIf you did not request it, do not use the linkUse Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",

      "Use Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "Also, if you get emails about changing your account email address, Instagram says those messages can include a way to reverse the change, which can help you recover if someone broke in.",
      "These real-looking messages are designed to create urgency and push people to click before slowing down and checking their account security. (Cyverguy.com)",
      "What a real Instagram password reset email looks like",

      "Sender: Comes from an official Instagram domain, such as security@mail.instagram.comSubject line: Often says \"Reset your Instagram password\" or \"Password reset request\"Instagram branding: Logo at the top with clean formattingCall to action button: A button like \"Reset Password\"Reassurance text: A line explaining that if you did not request this, you can ignore the email and nothing will changeSafety option: Language telling you how to report the email if you did not initiate it",

      "What scammers rely on",

      "What to do right now if you get a reset email you did not request",
      "So, what should you do if one of these password reset emails lands in your inbox? Take a breath first. Then do this.",
      "Even if the message looks real, treat it like a hot surface. If you want to change your password, do it from the Instagram app or by typing Instagram's address into your browser yourself. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection here. It can help block malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up scams that often appear during a reset email surge.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0is the biggest roadblock for account takeover. Even if someone knows your password, they still need your code to get in from an unfamiliar device. Instagram has pushed 2FA heavily for higher-risk accounts and urges users to enable it. Use an authenticator app if you can. It is often safer than SMS.",
      "If you suspect someone guessed your password, or you reused it elsewhere, change it. Make it long and unique. A password manager can help you generate and store strong passwords without reusing them. Then update the password on your email account too. Your email inbox controls most password resets, so make sure it also uses a strong, unique password.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password reset surges often follow data leaks. When your email address and personal details appear on data broker sites, attackers can target you more easily. A data removal service helps limit where your information shows up online. By shrinking your digital footprint, you reduce the chances of being singled out during large-scale reset email attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Login approval prompts you did not trigger",
      "Slow down and verify everything inside the app.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A spike in Instagram password reset emails feels scary because it looks like someone is already inside your account. Often, they are not. Still, the surge is a reminder to tighten your basics. Use the app to check security. Turn on two-factor authentication. Change the passwords you reused. Most importantly, do not let an unexpected email rush you into the one click that hands over access.",

      "If you are tired of scam calls slipping through the cracks, federal regulators just took a meaningful step. The Federal Communications Commission finalized new penalties aimed at telecom companies that submit false, inaccurate or late information to a key anti-robocall system. The changes go into effect Feb. 5. They strengthen oversight of the Robocall Mitigation Database, which plays a central role in tracking spoofed calls and holding providers accountable.",

      "What changed and why it matters",
      "Under the new rules, voice service providers must recertify every year that their filings in the Robocall Mitigation Database are accurate and current. The FCC will now back that requirement with real financial consequences.",
      "The FCC is cracking down on robocalls by tightening rules that govern how telecom providers verify and report call traffic. (iStock)",
      "FCC SCRUBS OWN REFERENCE TO 'INDEPENDENT' AGENCY FROM WEBSITE AFTER DEM'S TESTY EXCHANGE WITH CHAIRMAN",
      "Here is what the commission approved:",
      "$10,000 fines for submitting false or inaccurate information$1,000 fines for each database entry not updated within 10 business daysAnnual recertification of all provider filingsThe FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.Two-factor authentication to protect database accessA $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",

      "The FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.",
      "Two-factor authentication to protect database access",
      "A $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "The FCC also made clear that these violations are considered ongoing until corrected, meaning fines can accrue on a daily basis rather than being treated as one-time penalties.",
      "According to the FCC, many past submissions failed basic standards. Some lacked accurate contact details. Others included robocall mitigation plans that did not describe any real mitigation practices at all.",
      "How the Robocall Mitigation Database works",
      "The Robocall Mitigation Database requires providers to verify and certify the identities of callers that use their networks. Regulators and law enforcement rely on it to trace spoofed calls and illegal robocall campaigns. That task is harder than it sounds. America's telecom system is vast and fragmented. Calls often pass through multiple networks owned by major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, as well as smaller regional providers and VoIP services. When calls hop between networks, verification can be missed or ignored. For years, the FCC did not closely verify or enforce the accuracy of these filings. That gap raised serious concerns.",
      "Under the updated rules, providers that fail to recertify or correct deficient filings can be referred to enforcement and removed from the database, which can prevent other carriers from carrying their calls at all.",
      "Why inaccurate robocall data hurts consumers",
      "When robocall filings are wrong or outdated, scam calls are more likely to reach your phone. Providers may treat a call as trusted even when it should raise red flags. That gives robocallers more time to operate and makes it harder for regulators to shut them down quickly. The FCC says stronger penalties and tighter oversight are meant to close that gap before consumers pay the price.",
      "New FCC penalties target inaccurate robocall filings that have allowed scam calls to slip through carrier networks.\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Pushback and pressure on the FCC",
      "When the FCC proposed penalties, it asked whether violations should be treated as minor paperwork mistakes or as serious misrepresentations. Telecom trade groups pushed back. They argued that fines should not apply unless providers first get a chance to fix errors or unless the FCC proves the filings were willfully inaccurate.",
      "State attorneys general and the robocall monitoring platform ZipDX urged a tougher stance. They warned that false filings undermine every effort to stop illegal robocalls. The FCC ultimately chose a middle path. It rejected treating violations as harmless paperwork errors. At the same time, it stopped short of imposing the maximum penalties allowed by law.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday consumers, this move matters more than it may seem. Accurate robocall reporting makes it easier to trace scam calls, shut down bad actors and prevent spoofed numbers from reaching your phone. Stronger penalties give telecoms a reason to take these filings seriously instead of treating them as routine compliance chores.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "The FCC also set a firm annual deadline. Providers must recertify their robocall mitigation filings each year by March 1, creating a predictable enforcement checkpoint. While this will not end robocalls overnight, it tightens a weak link that scammers have exploited for years.",
      "Simple steps you can take right now to reduce robocalls",
      "Even with tougher FCC enforcement, scam calls will not disappear overnight. Here are a few smart steps you can take today to reduce your risk.",
      "Do not answer unknown calls. If it is important, a legitimate caller will leave a voicemail.Never press buttons or say yes to robocall prompts. That confirms your number is active and can trigger more scam calls.Report scam calls to your carrier. Most major carriers let you report robocalls directly through their call log or app.Register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov/. It will not stop scammers, but it can reduce legitimate telemarketing calls.Block repeat offenders.

      "Pro tip: remove your personal data at the source",
      "Robocalls do not come out of nowhere. Many start with your personal information being sold or shared by data brokers. These companies collect phone numbers, addresses, emails and even family details from public records, apps, purchases and online activity. Scammers and shady marketers buy that data to build call lists. Removing your data from data broker sites can reduce the number of robocalls you receive over time. You can try to do this manually by finding individual data broker websites and submitting removal requests one by one. The process is time-consuming and often needs to be repeated.",
      "Some people choose to use a data removal service to automate this process and continuously monitor for re-posting. That can help limit how often your phone number circulates among marketers and scammers. Less exposed data means fewer opportunities for robocallers to target you.

      "Robocalls thrive when accountability breaks down. By adding meaningful fines, stronger security, annual recertification and filing fees, the FCC is signaling that accuracy is no longer optional. Because penalties can continue to build until problems are fixed, telecoms now face real consequences for ignoring or delaying corrections. This rule forces providers to own their role in stopping illegal calls instead of passing the blame along the network chain. Real progress will depend on enforcement, but this is one of the clearest signs yet that regulators are closing gaps scammers rely on.",

      "That sense of security is exactly what attackers like to exploit. Security researchers have now uncovered a fresh wave of malicious Mac extensions that don't just spy on you, but can also steal cryptocurrency wallet data, passwords and even Keychain credentials.

      "How malicious Mac extensions slipped into trusted stores",
      "Security researchers at Koi Security uncovered a new wave of the GlassWorm malware hiding inside extensions for code editors like Visual Studio Code (via Bleeping Computer). If you're not familiar with code editors, they're tools developers use to write and edit code, similar to how you might use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit text. These malicious extensions appeared on both the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace and OpenVSX, platforms widely used by developers and power users.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "At first glance, the extensions looked harmless. They promised popular features like code formatting, themes or productivity tools. Once installed, though, they quietly ran malicious code in the background. Earlier versions of GlassWorm relied on hidden text tricks to stay invisible. The latest wave goes further by encrypting its malicious code and delaying execution, making it harder for automated security checks to catch.",
      "Even though this campaign is described as targeting developers, you don't need to write code to be at risk. If you use a Mac, install extensions or store passwords or cryptocurrency on your system, this threat still applies to you.",
      "What GlassWorm does once it's on your Mac",
      "Once active, GlassWorm goes after some of the most sensitive data on your device. It attempts to steal login credentials tied to platforms like GitHub and npm, but it doesn't stop there. The malware also targets browser-based cryptocurrency wallets and now tries to access your macOS Keychain, where many saved passwords are stored.",
      "Researchers also found that GlassWorm checks whether hardware wallet apps like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite are installed. If they are, the malware attempts to replace them with a compromised version designed to steal crypto. That part of the attack isn't fully working yet, but the functionality is already in place.",
      "To maintain access, the malware sets itself up to run automatically after a reboot. It can also allow remote access to your system and route internet traffic through your Mac without you realizing it, turning your device into a quiet relay for someone else.",
      "Some of the malicious extensions showed tens of thousands of downloads. Those numbers can be manipulated, but they still create a false sense of trust that makes people more likely to install them.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from malicious Mac extensions",
      "Malicious extensions don't look dangerous. That's what makes them effective. These steps can help you reduce the risk, even when threats slip into trusted marketplaces.",
      "Every extension you install increases risk. If you're not actively using one, remove it. Be especially cautious of extensions that promise big productivity gains, premium features for free or imitate popular tools with slightly altered names.",
      "Check who made the extension. Established developers usually have a clear website, documentation and update history. New publishers, vague descriptions or cloned names should raise red flags.",
      "These malicious extensions looked like helpful tools but quietly ran hidden code once installed. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "A password manager keeps your logins encrypted and stored safely outside your browser or editor. It also ensures every account has a unique password, so if one set of credentials is stolen, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HOW HACKERS ARE BREAKING INTO APPLE DEVICES THROUGH AIRPLAY",
      "Modern macOS malware doesn't always drop obvious files. Antivirus tools today focus on behavior, looking for suspicious background activity, encrypted payloads and persistence mechanisms used by malicious extensions. This adds a critical safety net when something slips through official marketplaces.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "When your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites and breaches databases. Personal data removal services help reduce how much of your information is publicly available, making it harder for attackers to target you with follow-up scams or account takeovers.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable 2FA wherever possible, especially for email, cloud services, developer platforms and crypto-related accounts. Even if a password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from logging in.",
      "Security updates close gaps that malware relies on. Turn on automatic updates so you're protected even if you miss the headlines or forget to check manually.",
      "Mac users often trust official app stores, but that trust is exactly what attackers are counting on. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "GlassWorm shows that malware doesn't always come from shady downloads or obvious scams. Sometimes it hides inside tools you already trust. Even official extension stores can host malicious software long enough to cause real harm. If you use a Mac and rely on extensions, a quick review of what's installed could save you from losing passwords, crypto or access to important accounts.",

      "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: Fox News' Nate Foy and Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla.,\u00a0 discuss a surge in teenage suicides related to online 'sextortion', identify the terror groups culpable and share advice for parents to keep their children safe.",
      "At first glance, the job posts look completely harmless. They promise fast money, flexible hours and paid training. No experience required. Payment comes in crypto. But these are not tutoring gigs or customer service roles. They are recruiting ads for ransomware operations.",
      "And many of the people responding are middle and high school students. Some posts openly say they prefer inexperienced workers. Others quietly prioritize young women. All of them promise big payouts for \"successful calls.\"",
      "What they leave out is the risk. Federal charges. Prison time. Permanent records. This underground ecosystem goes by a familiar name. Insiders often refer to it as \"The Com,\" short for \"The Community.\"",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Fake job ads promising fast cash and flexible hours are quietly recruiting teens into ransomware and extortion schemes, often paying in cryptocurrency to hide criminal activity. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How The Com operates behind the scenes",
      "The Com is not a single organized gang. It functions as a loose network of groups that regularly change names and members. Well-known offshoots tied to this ecosystem include Scattered Spider, Lapsus$,\u00a0ShinyHunters and related splinter crews. Some groups focus on data theft. Others specialize in\u00a0phishing or\u00a0extortion. Collaboration happens when it benefits the operation.",
      "Since 2022, these networks have targeted more than 100 major companies in the U.S. and UK. Victims include well-known brands across retail, telecom, finance, fashion and media, including companies such as T-Mobile, Nike and Instacart. The combined market value of affected companies exceeds one trillion dollars.",
      "Teenagers often take on the riskiest roles within these schemes. Phone calls, access testing and social engineering scripts typically fall to younger participants. More experienced criminals remain in the background, limiting their exposure.",
      "That structure mirrors what identity and fraud experts are seeing across the industry. Ricardo Amper, founder and CEO of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, says fake job ads are effective because they borrow trust from a familiar social contract.",
      "\"A job post feels structured, normal and safe, even when the actual behavior being requested is anything but,\" Amper said.\u00a0\"A job posting implies a real process - a role, a manager, training and a paycheck. That's exactly why it works. It lowers skepticism and makes risky requests feel like normal onboarding.\"",
      "Amper notes that what's changed is not just the scale of recruitment, but how criminals package it.\u00a0\"Serious crime is now being sold as 'work.'\"",
      "Why teens excel at social engineering attacks",
      "Teenagers bring a unique mix of skills that make them highly convincing. Fluent English and comfort with modern workplace technology help them sound legitimate. Familiarity with tools like Slack, ticketing systems and cloud platforms makes impersonation easier.",
      "According to Amper, teens don't need technical expertise to get pulled in.\u00a0\"The on-ramp is usually social, a Discord server, a DM, a 'quick gig,'\" he said.\u00a0\"It can feel like trolling culture, but the targets are real companies and the consequences are real people.\"",
      "Risk awareness is often lower. Conversations frequently take place in public chats, where tactics and mistakes are shared quickly. That visibility accelerates learning and increases the likelihood of detection and arrest.",
      "Gaming culture feeds the pipeline",
      "For many teens, it starts small. Pranks in online games turn into account takeovers. Username theft becomes crypto theft. Skills escalate. So do the stakes.",
      "Recruitment often begins in gaming spaces where fast learning and confidence are rewarded. Grooming is common. Sextortion sometimes appears. By the time real money enters the picture, legal consequences feel distant.",
      "Amper compares the progression to gaming itself.\u00a0\"These crews package crime as a ladder,\" he said.\u00a0\"Join the group, do small tasks, level up, get paid, get status.\"",
      "Why young women are being targeted",
      "Cybercrime remains male-dominated, but recruiters adapt. Young women are increasingly recruited for phone-based attacks. Some use AI tools to alter accents or tone. Others rely on stereotypes. Distress lowers suspicion faster than authority. Researchers say women often succeed because they are underestimated. That same dynamic puts them at risk inside these groups. Leadership remains overwhelmingly male. Girls often perform low-level work. Training stays minimal. Exploitation is frequent.",
      "Red flags that signal fake job scams and ransomware recruitment",
      "These warning signs show up repeatedly in cases involving teen hackers, social engineering crews and ransomware groups.",
      "Legitimate employers do not pay workers exclusively in cryptocurrency. Crypto-only pay makes transactions hard to trace and protects criminals, not workers.",
      "Promises of hundreds of dollars for a single call or quick task often point to illegal activity. Real jobs pay hourly or a salary with documentation.",
      "Criminal groups rely on private messaging apps to avoid oversight. Established companies do not recruit employees through gaming chats or encrypted DMs.",
      "Being \"trained from scratch\" by unnamed individuals is common in ransomware pipelines. These mentors disappear when arrests happen.",
      "Any job that asks teens to hide work from parents or employees to hide tasks from employers is crossing a line. Secrecy protects the recruiter, not the recruit.",
      "Amper offers a simple rule of thumb:\u00a0\"If a 'job' asks you to pretend to be someone else, obtain access, move money, or share sensitive identifiers before you've verified the employer, you're not in a hiring process. You're in a crime pipeline.\"",

In Sept. 2025, U.S. prosecutors unsealed a Department of Justice complaint\u00a0against 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, accusing him of orchestrating at least 120 ransomware and extortion attacks that brought in over $115 million in ransom payments from 47 U.S. companies and organizations, including federal court networks. Prosecutors charged Jubair with computer fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.",
      "Across the Atlantic, British authorities charged Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers for their alleged roles in a Transport for London cyberattack in 2024 that compromised travel card data and disrupted live commuter information.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "Touch something hot, and your hand snaps back before you even think. That split second matters.",
      "Sensory nerves in your skin send a rapid signal to your spinal cord, which triggers your muscles right away. Your brain catches up later. Most robots cannot do this. When a humanoid robot touches something harmful, sensor data usually travels to a central processor, waits for analysis and then sends instructions back to the motors. Even tiny delays can lead to broken parts or dangerous interactions.",
      "As robots move into homes, hospitals and workplaces, that lag becomes a real problem.",
      "A robotic skin designed to mimic the human nervous system",
      "Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and collaborating universities are tackling this challenge with a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, also known as NRE-skin. Instead of acting like a simple pressure pad, this skin works more like a human nervous system. Traditional robot skins can tell when they are touched. They cannot tell whether that touch is harmful. The new e-skin can do both. That difference changes everything.",

      "A humanoid robot equipped with neuromorphic e-skin reacts instantly to harmful touch, mimicking the human nervous system to prevent damage and improve safety. (Eduardo Parra/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "How the neuromorphic e-skin works",
      "The e-skin is built in four layers that mirror how human skin and nerves function. The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.",
      "How robots detect pain and trigger instant reflexes",
      "If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. The robot can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.",

      "Scientists developed a robotic skin that can detect pain and trigger reflexes without waiting for a central processor to respond. (Han Suyuan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Self-repairing robotic skin makes fixes fast",
      "The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.",
      "Why pain-sensing skin matters for real-world robots",
      "Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.",
      "What this technology means for the future of robots",
      "The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.",

And to be fair, they look irresistible on paper, offering thousands of channels for a one-time payment. But security researchers are warning that some of these boxes may come with a hidden cost.",

      "Android TV streaming boxes promising unlimited channels for a one-time fee may quietly turn home internet connections into proxy networks, according to security researchers. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",
      "The devices performed DNS hijacking and ARP poisoning on local networks, techniques used to redirect traffic and impersonate other devices on the same network. Some models even contained directories labeled \"secondstage,\" suggesting additional payloads or functionality beyond streaming.",
      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",
      "Around the same time, the Feds warned that compromised streaming and IoT devices were\u00a0being used to gain unauthorized access to home networks\u00a0and funnel traffic into criminal proxy services.",
      "We reached out to SuperBox for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "8 steps you can take to protect yourself",
      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your router supports it, isolate smart TVs and streaming boxes from your main network. This prevents a compromised device from seeing your laptops, phones or work systems. It's one of the simplest ways to limit damage if something goes wrong.",
      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on suspicious or fake websites, which can alert you before you make a mistake.",

A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",

      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",

      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",

      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",
      "If possible, request an IRS Identity Protection PIN to prevent tax-related identity theft.",
      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.

      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. Fewer exposed details means fewer scam calls, fewer phishing emails and fewer impersonation attempts. This step does not stop every scam, but it significantly lowers how often seniors are targeted in the first place.",

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Less tracking means fewer scam attempts. Aliases reduce how often personal email addresses are exposed, without changing daily habits.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",
      "Once granted, these permissions can allow apps to collect data in the background, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.",

      "3) Two-factor authentication (2FA)",
      "Your second line of defense",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.",
      "Even if hackers steal your password through a\u00a0data breach or\u00a0phishing attack, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.",
      "It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.",
      "Extra security tip:Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "4) VPN (Virtual Private Network)",
      "Hiding your online activity",
      "A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.",
      "VPNs are especially important when using public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops, where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.",
      "While a VPN doesn't make you completely anonymous online, it adds a valuable layer of privacy and security, especially when browsing, shopping or accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Cross-app tracking",
      "How companies follow you across apps",
      "Cross-app tracking lets advertisers and data brokers link your activity across multiple apps and websites. That data is used to build detailed profiles based on what you do, buy and watch.",
      "On\u00a0iPhone, this tracking is controlled by Apple's App Tracking Transparency system.On\u00a0Android, it relies on advertising IDs and ad personalization controls.",
      "Turning these off limits how easily companies can connect your behavior across apps. You'll still see ads, but they won't be tailored to your personal activity.",

      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",
      "According to the organization, the exposed data may have included names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, Social Security numbers, health insurance details and treatment information such as diagnoses, dates of treatment and types of care received.",

      "Qilin ransomware lists Covenant Health on its data leak site. (Bleeping Computer)",
      "What Covenant Health is telling patients",
      "In a notice sent to regulators and patients, Covenant Health says it engaged third-party forensic specialists to investigate the incident and determine what data was involved. The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",
      "Beginning Dec. 31, 2025, the organization started mailing notification letters to patients whose information may have been compromised. For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",
      "We reached out to Covenant Health, and the company confirmed the expanded scope of the incident and outlined steps being taken to notify patients and enhance security safeguards.",

      "The breach exposed highly sensitive information, including names, Social Security numbers, medical records and treatment details tied to nearly half a million patients. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself after the Covenant Health breach",
      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from all major bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or address changes. Catching fraud early makes it far easier to contain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",
      "That admission alone is alarming. What followed revealed a far broader pattern.",

      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

      "As Iran\u2019s national internet blackout stretches to its second week, the satellite internet service Starlink has become a crucial lifeline for many citizens to connect with the outside world \u2014 and one that the government appears to be trying to shut down.",
      "That\u2019s pushing some Iranians to get creative with how they use the service.",
      "In a video posted to Instagram and verified by NBC News, a man riding in the passenger seat of a car on an Iranian highway Tuesday said he had a Starlink device in the vehicle. He scrolls through his Instagram feed and visits speedtest.net, a popular site for testing internet connection speeds.",
      "\u201cYou are seeing it yourself,\u201d he says of Starlink\u2019s capabilities in the video, which NBC News translated from Farsi to English.",
      "As Iran\u2019s crackdown on communication continues, a game of cat and mouse has ensued, with Iran\u2019s government deploying new ways to halt or slow down Starlink connections, and activists and Starlink\u2019s parent company, Elon Musk\u2019s Space X, working to circumvent them.",
      "People opposed to the regime have been protesting in the streets across Iran for the last three weeks. The country\u2019s leadership cut off internet and phone access last week as protests and unrest gripped many parts of the country. It\u2019s a tactic that the Human Rights Watch says has helped the regime \u201cconceal widespread atrocities.\u201d",
      "According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 2,500 people have been killed in the mass protests across the country. (The agency relies on supporters inside Iran for information it then compiles and releases to the public. Iranian authorities have not provided an official death toll.)",
      "Iran has also lobbied the United Nations' arm devoted to regulating communications technology, the International Telecommunication Union, to force SpaceX to stop operating in Iran. So far, the U.N. has not done so.",
      "The near-total ban on outside communication has left Starlink, widely regarded as the most cost-effective and high-speed commercially available option for satellite internet access, as the only choice for many Iranians.",
      "In a video that was circulated on social media, body bags are seen lined up at the Tehran Province Forensic Medicine Diagnostic and Laboratory Center in the city of Kahrizak. At one point, the man recording the video tells the person he is talking to on the phone, \u201cIf you get ahold of a Starlink anywhere in Iran, let me know.\u201d",
      "But its use does not come without its own risks.",

      "\u201cWe know, according to the law, using Starlink is a big crime,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, a refugee from Iran and the director of the Miaan Group, a nonprofit digital rights group focused on the Middle East. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t know if this might be another level of censorship.\u201d",
      "In addition to the ongoing total ban on international internet traffic, the government also initially blocked international phone calls and access to local networks that had stayed operational during previous blackouts, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that tracks internet connectivity.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most severe internet shutdowns we\u2019ve ever seen. Total internet shutdown, international calling blockage, sporadic domestic connectivity disconnections, for a country of 92 million people,\u201d Madory said.",
      "Since then, Starlink has become a hot commodity. While there is no official count of terminals in Iran, reliable estimates are in the tens of thousands, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that works to get Iranians online.",
      "Satellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out",
      "-Ahmad Ahmadian, executive director of Holistic Resilience.",
      "Ahmadian said the Iranian government has been deploying \u201cjamming\u201d devices \u2014 a misnomer, as they do not fully disrupt Starlink terminals, but instead interfere with their traffic and can slow it down. That has somewhat been mitigated when Starlink forced an update to their terminals earlier this week, he said.",
      "\u201cSatellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out,\u201d he said.",
      "But that may change soon, Rashidi said, as Iran\u2019s government is actively working to improve its ability to invasively capture internet traffic as it travels to and from the satellites and identify the people using the devices.",
      "Starlink is fairly simple to use: A person just needs a small device called a terminal, which can connect to fleets of low-orbit satellites constantly circling the earth and provide a Wi-Fi signal to people nearby.",
      "But until this week, many terminals hadn\u2019t worked for many Iranians, Ahmadian said, as they usually require a paid subscription that often doesn\u2019t accept money from Iranian banks and credit cards. That changed when SpaceX suddenly waived the subscription fee for people in Iran, he said.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk, who regularly posts on X about Starlink, has not posted about it in relation to Iran, but earlier in the month boosted the company\u2019s post about providing free service to people in Venezuela through Feb. 3.",
      "Ahmadian said his group and others have worked for several years to smuggle Starlink terminals into the country, with a thriving black market for them.",
      "Iran\u2019s internet shutdown could last for months, Rashidi said, and getting terminals into the country is not easy. One activist group that has worked to get Starlink terminals into the country, NetFreedom Pioneers, showed how laborious the process can be.",
      "The group has raised nearly $50,000 on GoFundMe since June 2025, with recent donations surging alongside the protests. Though terminals generally range in cost from between $300 and $600, the group said in November that it had delivered 17 Starlink kits to people in Iran between June and September, at a cost of more than $18,000 to cover devices, subscriptions and the logistics to get them into the country.",
      "Most Iranians are unlikely to be able to afford the price tag \u2014  the rial currency plunged to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and euro. The country has also been crippled in recent years in part by sanctions from the U.S. and other international entities over the regime\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Online activists have also recently encouraged those in the U.S. to lobby their representatives to ask companies, including SpaceX, to enable direct-to-cell satellite internet to bypass the regime\u2019s blackout efforts."

      "The lawsuit comes after weeks of mounting backlash against Grok\u2019s ability to generate nonconsensual deepfakes, allowing users to remove clothes from people depicted in photos uploaded to the service and often replacing clothes with bikinis or underwear. Her lawsuit was filed in state court in New York but quickly transferred to the federal Southern District of New York after a request from xAI.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "St. Clair had notified xAI that users were creating illicit deepfake photos of her \u201cas a child stripped down to a string bikini\u201d and \u201cas an adult in sexually explicit poses\u201d and requested that the Grok service be prevented from creating the nonconsensual images, the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that even though Grok confirmed her \u201cimages will not be used or altered without explicit consent in any future generations or responses,\u201d xAI continued to allow users to create more explicit AI-generated images of her and instead retaliated by demonetizing her X account.",
      "X and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, xAI sued St. Clair in federal court in Texas, saying she violated xAI\u2019s terms of service and claiming damages of over $75,000. xAI said in its suit that any claims against the company must be filed in either federal court in the Northern District of Texas or in state courts in Tarrant County, Texas.",
      "Last week, X limited the capabilities of the @Grok reply bot, seemingly preventing it from generating the images that nonconsensually put identifiable people in revealing swimsuits or underwear. As of the time of the reporting, those capabilities remained intact on the standalone Grok app and the Grok website and in the dedicated Grok tab on X.",
      "Grok has been creating a flood of sexualized AI-generated images for weeks, with the pace reaching thousands such images per hour last week, according to researchers. Many of the images have been posted publicly on X.",
      "The creation and spread of nonconsensual sexualized images have sparked a worldwide response, including several government investigations and calls for smartphone app marketplaces to ban or restrict X. Regulators and other tech companies, though, have stopped short of restricting the app.",
      "California\u2019s attorney general launched an investigation into Grok on Wednesday as Gov. Gavin Newsom posted on X that \u201cxAI\u2019s decision to create and host a breeding ground for predators to spread nonconsensual sexually explicit AI deepfakes, including images that digitally undress children, is vile.\u201d",
      "St. Clair\u2019s suit alleges that Grok\u2019s feature allowing users to create nonconsensual deepfakes is a design defect and that the company could have foreseen the use of the feature to harass people with unlawful images.",
      "It says those depicted in the deepfakes, including St. Clair, suffered extreme distress.",
      "\u201cDefendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct, exceeding all bounds of decency and utterly intolerable in a civilized society,\u201d the suit says."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate negotiations aimed at striking a bipartisan deal to revive expired funds under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 or Obamacare \u2014 have fizzled, according to senators involved and sources with knowledge of the discussions.",
      "The odds of a deal have been slim for months. Now, on the day that ACA open enrollment ends, even the optimists have grown pessimistic as the working group falls behind its self-imposed timeline. The Senate left town Thursday for a one-week recess.",
      "Democrats are unified behind a three-year ACA funding extension, which passed the House recently with 230 votes, including 17 Republicans. President Donald Trump has threatened to veto that bill, instead releasing a health care blueprint that trashes the ACA funds as a \u201cflagrant scam\u201d and conveys his opposition to reviving the expired tax credits.",

A small group of GOP senators has engaged in talks with moderate Democrats about a compromise, but conservative demands to tie any deal to abortion restrictions have become \u201cintractable,\u201d said one source plugged in to the talks.",

Senator Moreno is trying to distract from the reality: the credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can\u2019t get their act together.\u201d",
      "Schumer\u2019s office said the minority leader met with Trump on Thursday at the White House. Among other topics of discussion, Schumer \u201craised the need for President Trump to push Senate Republicans to support the three-year extension of the ACA tax credit bill that has already passed the House,\u201d his office said.",

      "The popularity of \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d which tells the story of multiple NHL players who are closeted, has led one real-life hockey player to come out as gay.",
      "The main romance in \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d streaming on HBO Max, follows rival players Ilya (Connor Storrie) and Shane (Hudson Williams) and their secret relationship that spans multiple years. But one episode centers around the storyline between another closeted player named Scott Hunter (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud), who falls for an employee he meets at a smoothie shop named Kip (Robbie G.K.).",
      "At the end of Episode 5, Scott decides to publicly come out and invites Kip onto the ice to celebrate with him after his team wins the Stanley Cup. Scott and Kip share a passionate kiss and the hockey star later expresses his love for Kip while accepting an award.",
      "After seeing the show and being inspired by the storylines, hockey player Jesse Kortuem decided to publicly come out.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook Jan. 13, Kortuem wrote that the sounds heard in a hockey arena used to represent \u201cthe sound of a place where I felt I had to hide.\u201d",
      "The athlete, who recently participated in the Cutting Edges Hockey Club\u2019s Winter Classic event, added, \u201cI am a private person. Those who know me best know that I don\u2019t share much if anything publicly on social media, but lately, something has sparked in me (ok \u2014 yes credit to #HeatedRivalry). I realized it is finally time to share a journey I have kept close to the vest for a long time.\u201d",
      "Kortuem said he grew up in Minnesota as the youngest of four boys.",
      "\u201cAs a young teenager, I carried a weight that did not seem to fit into that world, and I lived in a constant state of dichotomy. I loved the game, but I lived with a persistent fear,\u201d he shared. \u201cI wondered how I could be gay and still play such a tough and masculine sport.\u201d",
      "He said his younger self never thought that coming out was possible as a professional hockey player. \u201cComing out in the 2000s did not feel like an option, especially with so little positive representation in the media at the time and it would have been a social disaster at such a large high school. At 17, I walked away from the high school team and the brotherhood of hockey friendships I had developed from a young age for a myriad of reasons,\u201d he explained.",
      "After stepping away, he returned to hockey and played \u201cat a high level\u201d in New York and Atlanta. He said people in his life knew he was gay, but he didn\u2019t speak about his sexuality with his teammates.",
      "\u201cOn the outside, I was still a top-tier player. On the inside, I was still that kid in Minnesota hiding,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLike many closeted athletes, revealing who I truly was to my team would change everything in an instant, their opinion of me, could bring negative attention to the team with the \u2018gay player\u2019, so I never took the chance.\u201d",
      "He remembered changing the subject if the other players mentioned their wives, and he always told them he was single. But he \u201creached a breaking point in 2017\u201d after he signed up to play in a gay sporting event.",
      "\u201cThis tournament would prove to be a paradigm shift. I met a group of guys from across the US and Canada (Las Vegas Boyz) who were hockey players like me and were also gay,\u201d Kortuem said. \u201cFrom that moment forward, my life has never been the same. It has been a long, vulnerable road to move past the closeted athlete persona (something I\u2019m still working on today) and find actual peace through the friendships I have developed through hockey in Vancouver (Cutting Edges), Toronto (Misfits), and across the US.\u201d",
      "He said during his most recent event with the Cutting Edges Hockey Club, he finally felt \u201cpeace\u201d on the rink.",
      "Kortuem ended his post with an uplifting message to other closeted athletes.",
      "\u201cThis is my story. It is not everyone\u2019s story, but for what it is worth, I thought I would share because I want to speak to the athletes out there who are still in the closet or struggling to find their way. I want you to know that there is hope and you\u2019re not alone. There is a life and a deep happiness waiting for you on your path. You will get through this, and it is going to be okay,\u201d he said.",
      "According to Out, Kortuem never played in the NHL, however, he did play defenseman and center in multiple other leagues.",
      "\u201cI know many closeted and gay men in the hockey world are being hit hard by \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019\u2019s success,\u201d Kortuem said when speaking to Out about how he personally connected to the show. \u201cNever in my life did I think something so positive and loving could come from such a masculine sport. I\u2019ve struggled the last few weeks to put these emotions into words, fearing the impact on team dynamics, etc.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cToday, I took the step to finally tell my hockey journey and my story. I\u2019m beyond grateful for all the positive comments I\u2019ve received from past teammates and high school teammates.\u201d"

      "\u201cWait, what?\u201d Kelce asked, clearly in a state of shock.",
      "Lovato explained that when she came to L.A. the first time, she went to the movies at the Grove and discovered how local her go-to cinema snack is.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Can I have a pickle?\u2019 And they were like, \u2018What?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll have a pickle with my popcorn.\u2019 And they were like, \u2018Where are you from? Like, we don\u2019t do that here,\u2019\u201d Lovato recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized \u2026 it must be a Southern thing or like a Texas thing. They give you a whole deli pickle and, like, this big jug.\u201d",
      "Kelce asked if it\u2019s a \u201cbarrel pickle from the deli,\u201d which Lovato confirmed.",

      "What\u2019s the Deal With Movie Theater Pickles?",
      "Regional delicacies, while humdrum to locals, can often seem outlandish to outsiders.",
      "In 2024, pickle enthusiast and popular TikToker Erica Kuiper, who had just moved to Austin, Texas, visited a theater to see if people were pulling her leg about the offering, ultimately finding that her theater had the briny baton, which she thoroughly enjoyed during her film.",
      "According to a 2020 article in The Dallas Morning News, pickles in Texan movie theaters date back to at least 1954, when the paper wrote about \u201cMelba Theater\u2019s refusal to take on the \u2018new trend\u2019\u201d because of the odor interfering with the scents they would pump through the air vents. For this reason, the theater didn\u2019t sell popcorn, either.",
      "And in case you\u2019re wondering, no, that theater no longer exists \u2014 it went out of business in the 1970s and was demolished in 2014.",
      "Texas isn\u2019t the only state where you can snag the salty snack before your showtime: Commenters on Kelce\u2019s clip say other Southern states like Louisiana and Arkansas stock pickles alongside Junior Mints, Twizzler and other concessions.",
      "And, according to folks in New Hampshire, South Dakota and Alaska, some non-Southern theaters have them, too.",
      "\u201cToday years old when I realized others didn\u2019t have pickles at the movies,\u201d commented one person.",
      "Why Do Some Movie Theaters Sell Pickles?",
      "We can add movie theater pickles to Germany\u2019s innovation list alongside BMW, gummy bears and aspirin.",
      "Per Garden and Gun, a 1957 article in The Dallas Morning News traced pickles in theaters back to Germany, noting that Germans eat \u201cnot only during intermissions,\u201d but chowed down on \u201clarge hunks of bread, knackwurst, pickles, mustard, and other tidbits\u201d during the show, too.",
      "The writer, Sam Acheson, said the food is \u201cgreat help in enduring, say, the last act of a Wagnerian opera\u201d the 19th century composer who still holds the Guinness record for the longest opera in history, at five hours.",
      "One wonders how folks from the 1800s would react to the pairing of a pickle with a large popcorn and a Cherry Icee while watching the four-hour \u201cJustice League.\u201d"

      "\u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d based on a 2019 book by the author Rachel Reid that tells a love story between two pro hockey players, was a project intended for a small Canadian streamer called Crave. When HBO Max picked up the show in the U.S. shortly before its November premiere, Storrie and his co-star, Hudson Williams, found themselves in the big leagues. As viewership rose, so did their stars. These two got big-time famous, in a way that now draws crowds of admirers wherever they go, including here at 30 Rock.",
      "For the show, Storrie, a 25-year-old Texas native, transforms into Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hockey prodigy with a thick accent, a complicated family and an irresistible attraction to a rival player. Both Storrie and Williams, who plays Shane Hollander, say they had chemistry from the jump, a key piece of the show that speaks to just how much audiences adore this story. \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d was picked up for Season 2 midway through the first season. Storrie told Craig Melvin on TODAY they may start shooting this summer.",
      "Storrie had shared that and much more on TODAY when he visited Studio 1A for a pair of live interviews. (And a tuna melt demo.) (And plaza fun with Al Roker.) And TODAY.com was able to catch up with Storrie in his green room in between it all.",

The windows behind him, though curtained, looked out at all the fans who braved sub-40\u00b0 weather for a glimpse of him.

I think he also was just such a fan that he saw whatever the fans of the book saw \u2014 that thing that makes everyone love this story.",
      "What that is, I think, can be a few different things. I think the love, the spice, the world, the connection. I think he was just a really, really big fan, and I think that love poured over into his interpretation of it.",
      "Everything that Jacob wrote in that monologue totally tracks, and I think that it really honors the book. Everything that (Ilya) has going on in his personal life, I kind of just have to click into that and believe that. And those words are so powerful that I think you can\u2019t really help but be moved. Professing your love for someone, especially in such a stressful moment, having this cathartic outbreak, you can\u2019t help but be emotional if you believe in it."

      "\u201cIlya feels so safe here, and even David is looking out for Ilya. He\u2019s giving him more food. He even tells him he gets Russian vodka. The care for Shane and by proxy, for Shane\u2019s partner, is so evident that Ilya immediately gets put at ease,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he is just happily chowing down because he has been through actual hell.\u201d"

There are no Leos or Capricorns, but plenty of mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces) to stir the pot. With Episodes 1 to 3 already aired, we are seeing major drama unfold.",
      "Read below to find out what zodiac sign is more likely to be a Traitor or Faithful.",
      "Aries",
      "Aries are driven to excel. Being that they are the first sign of the zodiac, they are full of bravado and gusto \u2014 so much so that the warrior sign won\u2019t stop until they peak to great heights. Aries will never allow themselves to be the sacrificial ram, making them a force to be reckoned with. They are born to conquer!",
      "Taurus",
      "Tauruses are great at gathering background information on the contestants, much like Carolyn Stanbury stated in Episode 1 of Season 4. However, that does not mean they\u2019re gossipy. The Bull likes to be in the know because it can manage the environment and be in tune with the energy that surrounds it without breaking a sweat, thereby defeating others.",
      "Gemini",
      "Geminis have a dualistic and duplicitous side to them, making them the perfect person to cause a ruckus on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201c The twin star might spill the tea, twist facts, and slip in some side eye to get their way \u2014 basically, the air sign will do anything to get their hands on the cash prize and the acclaim they crave.",
      "Cancer",
      "Cancers can be secretive at times, as their planetary ruler is the moon. Since their emotions change every few days from the lunar phases, they\u2019re tricky to read. You never know what you\u2019re going to get, which is why anyone who messes with a crab better watch out. Their pincers are no joke!",
      "Virgo",
      "Virgos are going to be methodical and authentic. Their approach to situations is based on what unfolds before their eyes. Then, they can assess and decide how they want to proceed, mindfully and cautiously. The earth sign may appear sweet and innocent, but its shadow side can be competitive and cutthroat \u2014 especially when it comes to money, acclaim and success.",
      "Libra",
      "Libras are fair-minded, meaning they will not veer from the rules unless they have to. While they put on a nice front, Libras can flirt with danger. If they are a Traitor or a Faithful, odds are that they\u2019ll be diplomatic in how they move forward on the show. Throughout the process, they\u2019ll have a smile on their faces.",

    "story": [
      "As Iran\u2019s national internet blackout stretches to its second week, the satellite internet service Starlink has become a crucial lifeline for many citizens to connect with the outside world \u2014 and one that the government appears to be trying to shut down.",
      "That\u2019s pushing some Iranians to get creative with how they use the service.",
      "In a video posted to Instagram and verified by NBC News, a man riding in the passenger seat of a car on an Iranian highway Tuesday said he had a Starlink device in the vehicle. He scrolls through his Instagram feed and visits speedtest.net, a popular site for testing internet connection speeds.",
      "\u201cYou are seeing it yourself,\u201d he says of Starlink\u2019s capabilities in the video, which NBC News translated from Farsi to English.",
      "As Iran\u2019s crackdown on communication continues, a game of cat and mouse has ensued, with Iran\u2019s government deploying new ways to halt or slow down Starlink connections, and activists and Starlink\u2019s parent company, Elon Musk\u2019s Space X, working to circumvent them.",
      "People opposed to the regime have been protesting in the streets across Iran for the last three weeks. The country\u2019s leadership cut off internet and phone access last week as protests and unrest gripped many parts of the country. It\u2019s a tactic that the Human Rights Watch says has helped the regime \u201cconceal widespread atrocities.\u201d",
      "According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 2,500 people have been killed in the mass protests across the country. (The agency relies on supporters inside Iran for information it then compiles and releases to the public. Iranian authorities have not provided an official death toll.)",
      "Iran has also lobbied the United Nations' arm devoted to regulating communications technology, the International Telecommunication Union, to force SpaceX to stop operating in Iran. So far, the U.N. has not done so.",
      "The near-total ban on outside communication has left Starlink, widely regarded as the most cost-effective and high-speed commercially available option for satellite internet access, as the only choice for many Iranians.",
      "In a video that was circulated on social media, body bags are seen lined up at the Tehran Province Forensic Medicine Diagnostic and Laboratory Center in the city of Kahrizak. At one point, the man recording the video tells the person he is talking to on the phone, \u201cIf you get ahold of a Starlink anywhere in Iran, let me know.\u201d",
      "But its use does not come without its own risks.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cWe know, according to the law, using Starlink is a big crime,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, a refugee from Iran and the director of the Miaan Group, a nonprofit digital rights group focused on the Middle East. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t know if this might be another level of censorship.\u201d",
      "In addition to the ongoing total ban on international internet traffic, the government also initially blocked international phone calls and access to local networks that had stayed operational during previous blackouts, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that tracks internet connectivity.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most severe internet shutdowns we\u2019ve ever seen. Total internet shutdown, international calling blockage, sporadic domestic connectivity disconnections, for a country of 92 million people,\u201d Madory said.",
      "Since then, Starlink has become a hot commodity. While there is no official count of terminals in Iran, reliable estimates are in the tens of thousands, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that works to get Iranians online.",
      "Satellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out",
      "-Ahmad Ahmadian, executive director of Holistic Resilience.",
      "Ahmadian said the Iranian government has been deploying \u201cjamming\u201d devices \u2014 a misnomer, as they do not fully disrupt Starlink terminals, but instead interfere with their traffic and can slow it down. That has somewhat been mitigated when Starlink forced an update to their terminals earlier this week, he said.",
      "\u201cSatellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out,\u201d he said.",
      "But that may change soon, Rashidi said, as Iran\u2019s government is actively working to improve its ability to invasively capture internet traffic as it travels to and from the satellites and identify the people using the devices.",
      "Starlink is fairly simple to use: A person just needs a small device called a terminal, which can connect to fleets of low-orbit satellites constantly circling the earth and provide a Wi-Fi signal to people nearby.",
      "But until this week, many terminals hadn\u2019t worked for many Iranians, Ahmadian said, as they usually require a paid subscription that often doesn\u2019t accept money from Iranian banks and credit cards. That changed when SpaceX suddenly waived the subscription fee for people in Iran, he said.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk, who regularly posts on X about Starlink, has not posted about it in relation to Iran, but earlier in the month boosted the company\u2019s post about providing free service to people in Venezuela through Feb. 3.",
      "Ahmadian said his group and others have worked for several years to smuggle Starlink terminals into the country, with a thriving black market for them.",
      "Iran\u2019s internet shutdown could last for months, Rashidi said, and getting terminals into the country is not easy. One activist group that has worked to get Starlink terminals into the country, NetFreedom Pioneers, showed how laborious the process can be.",
      "The group has raised nearly $50,000 on GoFundMe since June 2025, with recent donations surging alongside the protests. Though terminals generally range in cost from between $300 and $600, the group said in November that it had delivered 17 Starlink kits to people in Iran between June and September, at a cost of more than $18,000 to cover devices, subscriptions and the logistics to get them into the country.",
      "Most Iranians are unlikely to be able to afford the price tag \u2014  the rial currency plunged to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and euro. The country has also been crippled in recent years in part by sanctions from the U.S. and other international entities over the regime\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Online activists have also recently encouraged those in the U.S. to lobby their representatives to ask companies, including SpaceX, to enable direct-to-cell satellite internet to bypass the regime\u2019s blackout efforts."

He is at the spiral-shaped El Helicoide prison, infamous as a center of torture. Cipriani said prison authorities have allowed calls every two or three days in recent months, and she described her husband as \u201cserene,\u201d \u201ccalm and strong\u201d during their last conversation.",

      "She said the process of releasing hundreds of detainees \u201chas not yet concluded.\u201d",
      "Venezuela\u2019s government said Monday that 166 prisoners had been released but did not provide a list of names or evidence. On Tuesday, the head of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, said more than 400 people had been freed, but that figure includes two rounds of releases carried out before the U.S. captured Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3.",
      "Human rights groups dispute those numbers. Foro Penal, a leading rights organization that tracks and advocates for Venezuelan prisoners, says 79 had been released as of Wednesday night. An estimated 800 to 900 political prisoners were believed to have been incarcerated in Venezuela at the time of Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "The State Department announced Tuesday that multiple Americans who were detained in Venezuela have been released. Several detainees with Spanish citizenship were also let go last week.",
      "Diego Casanova, spokesperson for the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, told NBC News that members of the group have gone to prisons around the country to wait for releases. He said anxiety has increased because unofficial lists of political prisoners and names have been circulating, but so far nothing has been confirmed.",
      "\u201cIf only partial releases occur, this means that the repressive policy continues. All these people will remain unjustly detained, which is why we have insisted on the full and immediate release of all political prisoners,\u201d he said.",
      "Even after they are released, former political prisoners aren\u2019t fully free, Casanova said. They aren\u2019t viewed as political prisoners by the government and instead are seen as \u201cpoliticians who have broken the law and called for invasion,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said in a recent address.",
      "For example, they must periodically appear before a court to show that they are in the country and have complied with orders.",
      "\u201cThe judicial process remains open, which is very unjust because the crimes they are charged with are lies,\u201d Casanova said.",
      "The interim government is intensifying its crackdown on citizens, looking for signs of support for Maduro\u2019s capture. Fifteen minors and two 18-year-olds were arrested last week in Barcelona, in Anzo\u00e1tegui state, for allegedly celebrating the U.S. operation. Within 48 hours, they were taken before a court, where the judge ordered all to remain in custody.",
      "The 15 were released Tuesday following sustained pressure from their parents and neighbors. But the two 18-year-olds remain detained.",
      "Meanwhile, contacts between President Donald Trump and the Venezuelan leadership are ongoing.",

A short while later, a person or body is dragged into the police station, though it is not clear who this person is. Several members of the security forces in riot gear on motorcycles then drive into the police station.",
      "About 5 miles south of the capital's southern suburbs, the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center has offered perhaps the clearest sign of the crackdown's intensity.",

It attaches a price tag of more than half the Defense Department\u2019s annual budget to Trump\u2019s national security priority, which has stoked anxiety across Europe and on Capitol Hill amid his rhetoric about seizing Greenland since he ordered a U.S. military raid to capture Venezuela\u2019s president and his wife.",
      "Greenland, the semi-autonomous territory of the kingdom of Denmark, is not for sale. Officials from Denmark and Greenland have rejected Trump\u2019s claims that the U.S. will acquire Greenland \u201cone way or the other.\u201d A senior White House official, however, said Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been directed to come up with a proposal in the coming weeks to purchase Greenland, describing such a plan as a \u201chigh priority\u201d for Trump.",
      "On Wednesday, Rubio and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to meet with officials from Denmark and Greenland, who traveled to Washington seeking a better understanding of Trump\u2019s intentions and proposals. The meeting follows lower-level discussions last week between officials from Denmark and Greenland and the White House National Security Council.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to make a deal with them,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday when he was asked whether there is a deal Greenland could offer. \u201cIt\u2019s easier. But one way or the other, we\u2019re going to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "In the hours before Wednesday\u2019s meetings, the message from Greenland\u2019s government was consistent.",
      "\u201cGreenland does not want to be owned by, governed by or part of the United States,\u201d Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said as she arrived in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cWe choose the Greenland we know today \u2014 as part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\u201d"

      "Though Venezuela is China\u2019s only \u201call-weather\u201d strategic partner in Latin America, the relationship had deteriorated during Maduro\u2019s 12-year rule, with bilateral trade and Chinese investment dropping off as Venezuela fell behind on billions in Chinese loan repayments and faltered on oil production.",

      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, a push to take control of Greenland is a \u201cnational security\u201d necessity, critical to reinforcing control of the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China.",
      "For America\u2019s allies and Greenlanders themselves, however, Trump\u2019s threats to seize the semi-autonomous Danish territory cut much deeper, and threaten to shatter the decades-old principle of Western defense cooperation.",
      "But there may be little they can do to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis is a threat that is completely appalling, to be honest,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy another country, a people, the soul of Greenland,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cEverybody in Greenland is discussing it, and many people are worried and concerned.\u201d",
      "That alarm is shared across European capitals.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron accused the United States on Thursday of \u201cbreaking free from the international rules that it used to promote,\u201d while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the world risked descending into a \u201cden of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.\u201d",
      "Though it looms artificially large on a Mercator projection map, where it is stretched to the scale of Africa despite being 14 times smaller in size, Greenland has rarely figured so prominently in mainstream Western consciousness.",
      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is inhabited by only 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would most likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

    "summary": "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X over concerns that Grok had been \u201cused to create and share undressed images of people,\u201d including children.",
      "The agency, Ofcom, said it was carrying out an \u201cexpedited assessment\u201d and that X had responded to its requests for information on Friday. If Ofcom finds that X violated U.K. law, it can institute penalties ranging from sanctions of 10% of its global revenue, prohibiting British companies from advertising with X, or directing the country\u2019s internet providers to block the platform.",
      "The U.K. investigation is just one of the actions taken by governments around the world in response to Grok\u2019s deepfake abilities.",
      "Over the weekend, regulators in Indonesia and Malaysia announced they had temporarily blocked X in their countries, citing their laws against deepfakes and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).",
      "Mary Anne Franks, a George Washington University law professor who studies laws on nonconsensual pornography and has helped both state and federal legislators craft laws on the topic, said she does not expect the U.S. federal government to step in. But threats from other countries with stricter CSAM laws may force X and Musk to rein Grok in, she said.",
      "\u201cIf there is some slowdown, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of the backlash, and then separately, because these other countries have different definitions of what constitutes illegal CSAM,\u201d Franks said.",
      "Last week, after being prompted by users, Grok began creating thousands of sexualized AI-generated images every hour using the faces of real people and posting them on X, according to an analysis conducted by deepfake researcher Genevieve Oh. Many of the deepfakes depicted identifiable women who were placed in bathing suits or revealing poses by artificial intelligence; but Grok also depicted some people, including some children, according to some watchdogs, as fully nude.",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, told NBC News that the agency has recently observed Grok generating sexualized images of children.",
      "On Friday, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, a government agency dedicated to online safety, said it had received several reports of Grok creating exploitative images and had asked X to clarify its safeguards, noting that it could issue removal notices to X. Both Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, condemned the images on Saturday.",
      "Musk and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk and X recently posted that they prohibit users from making \u201cillegal content,\u201d but have refrained from publicly indicating that they would substantially change Grok\u2019s ability to manipulate and sexualize images of people. The creation and possession of CSAM are widely illegal around the world, but many countries also have laws restricting or prohibiting the creation of sexualized images of adult people without their consent, known as nonconsensual pornography.",
      "Early Friday, X made the Grok reply bot, which was driving the deepfake trend, a premium feature for paying subscribers, though users could still produce the deepfakes using the Grok stand-alone app in addition to other interfaces where Grok was available. While the number of such images posted to X appears to have slowed, critics like Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have said the move is tantamount to making \u201csome of its users pay for the privilege of producing horrific images on the X app.\u201d",
      "Ofcom said its investigation would focus on whether X has been following U.K. law by quickly taking down illegal content as it became aware of it, and whether it was carrying out successful risk assessments before making \u201csignificant changes to their service.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a radio interview that Ofcom \u201chas our full support to take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is disgraceful. It\u2019s disgusting. And it\u2019s not to be tolerated,\u201d he said of the image creation. \u201cX has got to get a grip of this.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, MeitY, also reportedly warned X last week that it was potentially violating its laws. MeitY didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "It remains unclear if any U.S. regulators will take on Musk and his companies over the manipulated images. The Federal Trade Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department told NBC News last week that it was committed to holding \u201cindividuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable\u201d accountable but didn\u2019t mention specific companies.",
      "A number of state attorneys general have declined to comment to NBC News on whether they are considering charges over the images.",
      "Musk has broadly pushed for X and his AI company that powers Grok, xAI, to be laxer on content moderation than most of their competitors. On Friday, he posted on X that reports of the U.K.\u2019s Labour Party wanting to potentially block X over the Grok images were evidence that \u201cThey want any excuse for censorship.\u201d",
      "Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said at a news conference Monday that it has given Musk and X an ultimatum to stop the production of CSAM, but stopped short of mentioning any specific penalties.",
      "\u201cDrawing a parallel between freedom of speech and an AI tool that generates child sexual abuse material is dangerous nonsense, especially when it comes from the owner of a tech company. Frankly speaking I cannot even believe we are speaking about this and engaging with this from the commission\u2019s podium in 2026,\u201d Regnier said.",
      "In December, the European Commission fined X $140 million, saying that the platform broke Europe\u2019s laws against hate speech and misinformation. That prompted criticism from the Trump administration, with both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it an attack on American free speech."

A fourth woman sits slumped against a wall, muttering while listlessly banging her head.",

Kordasti, who is a hemato-oncologist, meaning he treats people with disorders and cancers related to the blood, also criticized a \u201clack of supply and support at the hospital\u201d and a \u201clack of communication.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of my colleagues on his way to the hospital was shot and himself injured,\u201d he said, adding that doctors he had been in contact with were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from what they had seen \u201cand they can\u2019t even talk properly.\u201d",

At the beginning of the protests, they came to him for advice on how to treat tear gas inhalation, blunt force trauma and pellet wounds, he said in a telephone interview, but that changed on Thursday when the internet went down.",
      "\u201cRather than people reaching out for advice about treating wounds you\u2019re hearing people just telling you that they\u2019re seeing protesters being killed,\u201d Mirhadi said. \u201cIt shifted after that internet blackout. The level of the violence went up.\u201d",
      "He added that he thought that over 1,000 people have been killed in Tehran since Thursday based on the information he has received. He had also heard disturbing messages from colleagues in Tehran and Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second largest city, he said.",
