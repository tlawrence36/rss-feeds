      "Attorneys for hip-hop producer Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs say a federal judge in New York should delay his sex-trafficking trial by two months so they can better prepare a defense",
      "NEW YORK -- Attorneys for hip-hop producer Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs asked a federal judge in New York on Wednesday to delay his May 5 sex-trafficking trial by two months so they can better prepare a defense.",
      "The lawyers said in a letter to Judge Arun Subramanian that prosecutors have been slow to turn over some potential evidence for review, making it difficult to be ready in three weeks.",
      "Prosecutors oppose the request, the lawyers said. A spokesperson for prosecutors declined comment.",
      "Subramanian wrote in an order responding to the delayed-trial request that he will address the issue during a hearing scheduled for Friday.",
      "Pending the conference, the judge wrote, both sides should proceed as if the early May trial remains in place.",
      "Combs, 55, has been held without bail since his September arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to multiple crimes that prosecutors say occurred over a two-decade period.",
      "In their letter, defense lawyers cited a failure by prosecutors to turn over potential trial evidence in a timely matter, including materials relating to a superseding indictment returned by a grand jury earlier this month.",
      "For instance, the lawyers wrote, prosecutors have said they will not meet a Wednesday deadline to turn over exhibits and a witness list.",
      "Some evidence yet to be turned over includes materials related to a count in the indictment that carries a 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence if a conviction is secured, the lawyers said.",
      "As a result, they wrote: \u201cWe cannot, in good conscience, go to trial on the scheduled date.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThis is a problem that the government has created, yet it opposes our reasonable request.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say Combs coerced and abused women for years as he used his \u201cpower and prestige\u201d as a music star to enlist a network of associates and employees to help him while he silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",

The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "Taymor McIntyre faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the killing of 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar in 2017. McIntyre had already been been serving a 55-year sentence over a separate fatal shooting.",
      "Prosecutors said that McIntyre shot Saldivar after the rapper tried to rob him. Authorities said McIntyre had picked up Saldivar, who was a photographer, in a car after asking him to take photos of the rapper for a new song.",
      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",
      "The jury found McIntyre not guilty of capital murder, which would have meant a life sentence without the chance of parole. The jury will now hear evidence in the trial\u2019s punishment phase before deciding on a sentence.",
      "McIntyre was also convicted in 2019 for the shooting death of 21-year-old Ethan Walker during a home invasion in 2016 in Mansfield, southeast of Fort Worth, Texas.",

      "NAPLES, Italy -- Hundreds of once-missing artifacts, hunted down over decades by a special police unit, have been unveiled for the first time in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, in southern Italy.",
      "In its vaults, the museum preserves 15,000 artifacts seized or confiscated from the black market over the years by a police unit focused on the protection of cultural heritage. It is the loot of raiders who for decades have targeted sites from classical antiquity in southern Italy, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "From its repository, the museum selected 600 pieces to display for visitors. Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",

      "NEW YORK -- Ten emerging writers, from an author of speculative fiction to a poet rooted in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, have received $50,000 grants from the Whiting Foundation.",
      "Since 1985, the foundation has had a mission to nurture \u201cnew creations\u201d by supporting poets, playwrights and authors of fiction and nonfiction. Past winners have included Tony Kushner, Andr\u00e9 Aciman and Tracy K. Smith.",
      "This week, the foundation announced its class of 2025. Elwin Cofman writes speculative fiction that Whiting judges say offers \u201cilluminating sites of bawdy humor and horror,\u201d while Karisma Price crafts post-Katrina poems that are \u201csongs, howls, portraits, critiques.\u201d Judges praised the essays of Aisha Sabatini Sloan for their \u201cstartling connections between the personal and the collective.\u201d",
      "The other winners were dramatist Liza Birkenmeier, fiction writers Samuel K\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1w\u1ecdl\u00e9, Shubha Sunder and Claire Luchette, graphic fiction writer Emil Ferris, poet Annie Wenstrup and nonfiction writer Sofi Thanhauser.",
      "\u201cThese writers demonstrate astounding range; each has invented the tools they needed to carve out their narratives and worlds,\u201d Courtney Hodell, Whiting\u2019s director of literary programs, said in a statement. \u201cTaken as a whole, their work shows a sharply honed sensitivity to our history, both individual and collective, and a passionate curiosity as to where a deeper understanding of that history can take us.\u201d",

      "Before she kicks off her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry is reaching for the stars",
      "ONTARIO, Calif. -- After a long day of rehearsing for her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry decided to peruse a few books to help her unwind before bed.",
      "\u201cI was listening to \u2018Cosmos\u2019 by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars. We are all made of stardust and we all come from the stars.\u201d",
      "But the pop superstar was motivated by more than just curiosity. On Monday, she will join Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King and three other women on an all-female Blue Origin spaceflight. Perry spoke with The Associated Press at her Southern California rehearsal space on Wednesday, days before she was set to leave for training in Texas.",
      "\u201cI am talking to myself every day and going, \u2018You\u2019re brave, you\u2019re bold, you are doing this for the next generation to inspire so many different people but especially young girls to go, \u201cI\u2019ll go to space in the future.\u201d No limitations,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Perry said she has been \u201cpsychologically\u201d preparing for the spaceflight by reading work from the late Sagan and other scientists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the engineering of it all. I\u2019m excited to learn more about STEM and just the math about what it takes to accomplish this type of thing,\u201d she said.",
      "An all-female spaceflight seems an apt endeavor for the 40-year-old Perry, whose collection of hits include songs about extraterrestrials (\u201cE.T.\u201d) and fireworks shooting across the sky (\u201cFirework\u201d), as well as feminist anthems like her 2013 hit, \u201cRoar,\u201d and \u201cWOMAN\u2019S WORLD,\u201d off her most recent album.",
      "Perry said that whenever she is doing something new or daunting, she looks inward for strength and confidence.",
      "\u201cUsing that feminine divine that I was born with and definitely unlocked when I had my daughter even more. It leveled up for sure. Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Daisy, 4, joined Perry before her rehearsal.",
      "Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin announced the crew in February. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the women who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from West Texas aboard a New Shepard rocket. Perry, Sanchez and King will be joined by Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist who now heads an engineering firm, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\u201cI am feeling so grateful and grounded and honored to be invited and included with this incredible group of women,\u201d Perry said. Whenever she gets nervous about the trip, she reminds herself how important it is.",
      "Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021, after Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural trip; the upcoming trip will be the company's 11th human spaceflight. Some passengers have received free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. The company declined to comment on who is footing the bill for Monday's flight.",
      "The news of the upcoming trip has not been without critiques, most recently from actor Olivia Munn, who bemoaned the mission's cost and publicity. But Perry believes an all-women crew \u2014 the first since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo spaceflight in 1963 \u2014 has historic ramifications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\u201d she said, citing the fact that only about 11% of the people who have gone to space have been women. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that number to be even more equal after this flight. And I just feel like, \u2018Put us in coach.\u2019\u201d",

      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -- A merengue icon, a baseball star and others killed when a cement roof collapsed at a popular nightclub in the Dominican Republic were buried Thursday, as authorities called off the search for bodies with the death toll at 221.",
      "Mourners clad in black and white streamed into Santo Domingo\u2019s National Theater, where the body of singer Rubby P\u00e9rez lay inside a closed coffin. P\u00e9rez had been performing on stage at the packed Jet Set club early Tuesday when dust began falling from the ceiling and, seconds later, the roof caved.",
      "President Luis Abinader and first lady Raquel Arbaje arrived at the theater and stood beside P\u00e9rez's coffin for several minutes. Some mourners doubled over in tears as a recording of P\u00e9rez singing the national anthem played. Renowned Dominican musician Juan Luis Guerra was among those gathered to pay their respects.",
      "P\u00e9rez, 69, had turned to music after a car accident left him unable to pursue his dream of becoming a professional baseball player. He was known for hits including \u201cVolver\u00e9,\" which he sang with Wilfrido Vargas's orchestra, and \u201cBuscando tus besos\" as a solo artist.",
      "After a five-hour memorial, mourners released dozens of white balloons outside the theater and spontaneously sang \u201cVolver\u00e9\u201d in unison. One woman put her hand over her heart and patted it as she cried.",
      "At the cemetery, Zulinka P\u00e9rez, one of his daughters, said: \u201cI knew he was loved but I never imagined this.\u201d",
      "Just blocks from the memorial for P\u00e9rez, heavy equipment began withdrawing from the site where Jet Set once stood and rescue crews packed up their equipment.",
      "Meanwhile, a group of prosecutors arrived.",
      "It is still unclear what caused the roof to collapse or when the building was last inspected. The government has said it will launch a thorough investigation, and the club\u2019s owners have said they are cooperating with authorities.",
      "Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, broke down as he addressed reporters.",
      "\u201cThank you, God, because today we accomplished the most difficult task I\u2019ve had in 20 years,\u201d he said, moving the microphone away from his face as he cried. Other officials patted him on the back as he continued, \u201cPlease forgive me,\u201d before passing the microphone to an army official.",
      "Officials said 189 people were rescued alive from the rubble. More than 200 were injured, with 23 of them still hospitalized, including eight in critical condition.",
      "\u201cIf the trauma is too great, there\u2019s not a lot of time\u201d left to save patients in that condition, said Health Minister V\u00edctor Atallah. He and other doctors said some of the injured suffered fractures to the skull, femur and pelvis.",
      "Many people have been anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones, growing frustrated with the drip-drip of information provided by hospitals and the country\u2019s forensic institute.",
      "At least 146 bodies have been identified, authorities said Thursday.",
      "Mar\u00eda Luisa Taveras told TV station Noticias SIN that she was looking for her sister.",
      "\u201cWe have gone everywhere they have told us,\u201d she said, her voice breaking.",
      "Taveras said the family has spread out, with a relative stationed at each hospital and at the National Institute of Forensic Pathology. Dozens of people waited at the institute Thursday, wearing face masks and complaining about the smell as they demanded the release of their loved ones' bodies.",
      "\u201cThe odor is unbearable,\u201d said Wendy Sosa, who has been waiting since Wednesday morning for the body of her cousin, 61-year-old Nilka Curiel Gonz\u00e1lez. Sosa told The Associated Press by phone that the situation there was \u201cchaotic,\u201d and that officials had set up a refrigerated container to handle the volume of bodies being delivered.",
      "She wept as she described her cousin as gracious, authentic, and \u201cvery empathetic.\"",
      "Victims identified so far include former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera; and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz.",
      "Dotel was buried Thursday in Santo Domingo. Hundreds of people attended his wake on Wednesday, including Hall of Famer David Ortiz, formerly of the Boston Red Sox. Ortiz said the number of people who attended Dotel\u2019s wake spoke volumes.",
      "\u201cHe was a person whom everyone loved,\u201d Ortiz told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, very hard, truly.\u201d",

      "Also killed was a retired United Nations official; saxophonist Luis Sol\u00eds, who was playing onstage when the roof fell; New York-based fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco; the son and daughter-in-law of the minister of public works; the brother of the vice minister of the Ministry of Youth; and three employees of Grupo Popular, a financial services company, including the president of AFP Popular Bank and his wife.",

      "The governor held a communal wake, setting up 10 stands for coffins beneath a banner that read: \u201cHaina bids farewell to her beloved children with immense sorrow.\u201d",

      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain abortions in 2024 than a year earlier, a new survey has found.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",

      "The year-to-year impact varies by state.",
      "For instance, about 1 in 8 abortions in Florida in the first half of 2023 were provided to people coming from out of state. By the second half of 2024 \u2014 when a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect \u2014 only about 1 in 50 were for people from another state.",
      "More people traveled to states including Virginia and New York after the Florida law took hold.",
      "A drop in people traveling to Minnesota could be linked to abortions being offered again in clinics in Wisconsin.",
      "Most abortions in Kansas are provided to people from elsewhere and the number grew as clinic capacity expanded.",
      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",

      "An Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis shows one in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours",
      "AURORA, Ill. -- At her mother\u2019s home in Illinois, Tracy Balhan flips through photos of her dad, Bill Speer. In one picture, he\u2019s smiling in front of a bucket of sweating beers and wearing a blue T-shirt that reads, \u201cPops. The man. The myth. The legend.\u201d",
      "Balhan\u2019s father died last year after struggling with dementia. During one episode late in his life, he became so agitated that he tried to exit a moving car. Balhan recalls her dad \u2014 larger than life, steady and loving \u2014 yelling at the top of his lungs.",
      "His geriatric psychiatrist recommended she take him to the emergency room at Endeavor Health\u2019s Edward Hospital in the Chicago suburb of Naperville because of its connection to an inpatient behavioral care unit. She hoped it would help get him a quick referral.",
      "But Speer spent 12 hours in the emergency room \u2014 at one point restrained by staff \u2014 waiting for a psych evaluation. Balhan didn\u2019t know it then, but her dad\u2019s experience at the hospital is so common it has a name: ER boarding.",
      "One in six visits to the emergency department in 2022 that resulted in hospital admission had a wait of four or more hours, according to an Associated Press and Side Effects Public Media data analysis. Fifty percent of the patients who were boarded for any length of time were 65 and older, the analysis showed.",
      "Some people who aren\u2019t in the middle of a life-threatening emergency might even wait weeks, health care experts said.",
      "ER boarding is a symptom of the U.S. health care system\u2019s struggles, including shrinking points of entry for patients seeking care outside of ERs and hospitals prioritizing beds for procedures insurance companies often pay more for.",
      "Experts also warn the boarding issue will worsen as the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. with dementia grows in the coming decades. Hospital bed capacity in the U.S. may not keep up. Between 2003 and 2023, the number of staffed hospital beds was static, even as emergency department visits shot up 30% to 40% over that same period.",
      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

      "A man has been arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters after threatening violence",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A man was arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters in Minnesota after threatening violence, months after the company's CEO was killed, authorities said Monday.",
      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",
      "\u201cWhile the investigation is still in its early stages, there is currently no indication that the individual had specific grievances against UnitedHealthcare,\u201d Wittenborg said in a statement.",
      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione also faces federal charges, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this month she has directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty.",

    "story": [
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance",
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance.",
      "The easily preventable disease, declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, ripped through communities sprawling across more than 20 Texas counties in part because health departments were starved of the funding needed to run vaccine programs, officials say.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a strong immunization program that can really do a lot of boots-on-the-ground work for years,\u201d said Katherine Wells, the health director in Lubbock, a 90-minute drive from the outbreak's epicenter.",
      "Immunization programs nationwide have been left brittle by years of stagnant funding by federal, state and local governments. In Texas and elsewhere, this helped set the stage for the measles outbreak and fueled its spread. Now cuts to federal funding threaten efforts to prevent more cases and outbreaks.",
      "Health departments got an influx of cash to deal with COVID-19, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for years of neglect. On top of that, trust in vaccines has eroded. Health officials warn the situation is primed to get worse.",
      "Recent cuts by the Trump administration have pulled billions of dollars in COVID-19 related funding \u2014 $2 billion of it slated for immunization programs for various diseases. Overseeing the cuts is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rose to prominence leading an anti-vaccine movement. While Kennedy has said he wants his agency to prevent future outbreaks, he's also declined to deliver a consistent and forceful message that would help do so \u2014 encouraging people to vaccinate their children against measles while reminding them it is safe.",
      "At the same time, lawmakers in Texas and about two-thirds of states have introduced legislation this year that would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or otherwise put up barriers to ensuring more people get shots, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That further undercuts efforts to keep infectious diseases at bay, health officials said.",
      "The more than 700 measles cases reported this year in the U.S. have already surpassed last year\u2019s total. The vast majority \u2014 more than 540 \u2014 are in Texas, but cases have popped up in 23 other states. Two Texas children have died. A 6-year-old girl from Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, died in February, the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. An 8-year-old girl from the same town, Seminole, died earlier this month.",
      "Children in the U.S. are generally required to be vaccinated to go to school, which in the past ensured vaccination rates stayed high enough to prevent infectious diseases like measles from spreading. But a growing number of parents have been skipping the shots for their kids. The share of children exempted from vaccine requirements has reached an all-time high, and just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023. That\u2019s well below the 95% coverage level that keeps diseases at bay.",
      "Keeping vaccination rates high requires vigilance, commitment and money.",
      "Though the outbreak in Texas started in Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, it quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates. There are similar under-vaccinated pockets across the country that could provide the tinder that sparks another outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a hurricane over warm water in the Caribbean,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s warm water, the hurricane will continue to accelerate. In this case, the warm water is the unvaccinated kids.\u201d",
      "Lubbock receives a $254,000 immunization grant from the state annually that can be used for staff, outreach, advertising, education and other elements of a vaccine program. That hasn\u2019t increased in at least 15 years as the population grew.",
      "It used to be enough for three nurses, an administrative assistant, advertising and even goodies to give out at health fairs, Wells said. \u201cNow it covers a nurse, a quarter of a nurse, a little bit of an admin assistant, and basically nothing else.\u201d",
      "Texas has among the lowest per capita state funding for public health in the nation, just $17 per person in 2023, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.",
      "Vaccines are among the most successful tools in public health\u2019s arsenal, preventing debilitating illnesses and lowering the need for expensive medical care. Childhood vaccines prevent 4 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says the measles vaccine will save some 19 million lives by 2030.",
      "U.S. immunization programs are funded by a variable mix of federal, state and local money. Federal money is sent to every state, which then decides how much to send to local health departments.",
      "The stagnant immunization grant funding in Texas has made it harder for local health departments to keep their programs going. Lubbock\u2019s health department, for example, doesn't have the money to pay for targeted Facebook ads to encourage vaccinations or do robust community outreach to build trust.",
      "In Andrews County, which borders Gaines County, the biggest cost of its immunization program is personnel. But while everything has gotten more expensive, the grant hasn't changed, Health Director Gordon Mattimoe said. That shifts the burden to county governments. Some kick in more money, some don\u2019t. His did.",
      "The problem: keeping people safe from outbreaks requires high vaccination rates across a broad region, and germs don\u2019t stop at county borders.",
      "Andrews County, population 18,000, offers a walk-in vaccine clinic Monday through Friday, but other West Texas communities don\u2019t. More than half the people who come to the clinic travel from other counties, Mattimoe said, including much larger places and Gaines County.",
      "Some had to drive an hour or more. They did so because they had trouble getting shots in their home county due to long waits, lack of providers and other issues, Mattimoe said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unable to obtain it in the place that they live. ... People are overflowing, over to here,\u201d Mattimoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s an access issue.\u201d",
      "That makes it more likely people won\u2019t get their shots.",
      "In Gaines County just 82% of kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Even in Andrews County, where, at 97%, the vaccination rate is above the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks, it has slipped two percentage points since 2020.",
      "The health departments millions of Americans depend on for their shots largely rely on two federal programs: Vaccines for Children and Section 317 of the Public Health Services Act. Vaccines for Children mostly provides the actual vaccines. Section 317 provides grants for vaccines but also to run programs and get shots into arms.",
      "About half of kids qualify for Vaccines for Children, a safety-net program created in response to a 1989-1991 measles epidemic that sickened 55,000 people and killed 123. Section 317 money sent to state and local health departments pays for vaccines as well as nurses, outreach and advertising.",
      "Health departments generally use the programs in tandem, and since the pandemic they\u2019ve often been allowed to supplement it with COVID-19 funds.",
      "The 317 funds have been flat for years, even as costs of everything from salaries to vaccines went up. A 2023 CDC report to Congress estimated $1.6 billion was needed to fully fund a comprehensive 317 vaccine program. Last year, Congress approved less than half that: $682 million.",
      "This, along with insufficient state and local funding, forces hard choices. Dr. Kelly Moore, a preventive medicine specialist, said she faced this dilemma when directing Tennessee's immunization program from 2004 to 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat diseases can we afford to prevent and how many people can we afford to protect? Those decisions have to be made every year by every state,\u201d said Moore, who now runs the advocacy group Immunize.org.",
      "A rural clinic may have to be closed, or evening and weekend hours eliminated, she said. \u201cIt becomes difficult for them to staff the clinics they have and difficult for the people in those communities to access them, especially if they\u2019re the working poor.\u201d",
      "At the same time, health officials say more funding is needed to fight misinformation and mistrust about vaccines. In a 2023 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, 80% of local health departments reported vaccine hesitancy among patients or their parents in the previous year, up from 56% in 2017.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in education, it becomes even more difficult to get these diseases under control,\" Moore said.",
      "Facing these headwinds, things got much worse in March when Kennedy\u2019s health department canceled billions of dollars in state and local funding. After 23 states sued, a judge put a hold on the cuts for now in those states but not in Texas or other states that didn\u2019t join the lawsuit.",
      "But local health departments are not taking chances and are moving to cut services.",
      "HHS said the money, allocated through COVID-19 initiatives, was cut because the pandemic was over. But CDC had allowed the money to be used to shore up public health infrastructure generally, including immunization programs.",
      "Before he was confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy vowed not to take vaccines away. But in Texas, his department\u2019s cuts mean state and local health departments are losing $125 million in immunization-related federal funding as they deal with the measles outbreak. A spokesperson for the federal health department did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "Dallas County, 350 miles from where the outbreak began, had to cancel more than 50 immunization clinics, including at schools with low measles vaccination rates, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county\u2019s health director.",
      "Near the center of the outbreak, Lubbock\u2019s health department said seven jobs are on the line because they were paid by those grants. Included in the affected work are immunizations.",
      "Across the border in New Mexico, where the outbreak has spread, the state lost grants that funded vaccine education.",
      "It's still unclear how the recently announced $2 billion in cuts will affect immunization programs across the country, but details are starting to trickle out from some states.",
      "Washington state, for example, would lose about $20 million in vaccination-related funding. Officials were forced to pause mobile vaccine efforts on their \u201cCare-A-Van,\u201d which has administered more than 6,800 COVID-19 vaccines, 3,900 flu vaccines and 5,700 childhood vaccines since July. The state also had to cancel more than 100 vaccine clinics scheduled through June, including more than 35 at schools.",
      "Connecticut health officials estimate if the cuts stand, they will lose $26 million for immunization. Among other reductions, this means canceling 43 contracts with local health departments to increase vaccination rates and raise confidence in vaccines, losing vaccination clinics and mobile outreach in underserved neighborhoods, and stopping the distribution of vaccine-related educational materials.",
      "Several of the 23 states suing the federal government, including Minnesota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, cite losses to vaccine programs.",
      "As the cuts further cripple already struggling health departments, alongside increasingly prominent and powerful anti-vaccine voices, doctors worry that vaccine hesitancy will keep spreading. And measles and other viruses will too.",
      "\u201cMy whole life\u2019s purpose is to keep people from suffering. And vaccines are a tremendous way to do that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t invest in them to get them in arms, then we don\u2019t see their benefits.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t actually administer the dollars, how are you going to actually get them out to the programs?\u201d she said. \u201cWith this current administration, it\u2019s almost like every day we receive an unexpected notice, and then we will get a follow-up notice that says ... you need to move forward as usual.\u201d",
      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",
      "Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said he told Kennedy privately that consulting with and engaging in respectful partnerships with tribes is key to fulfilling the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities.",
      "Since the Trump administration began making massive cuts to the federal workforce, many tribal leaders have had to clarify with newly appointed federal officials that services to tribes are not based on race but rather on the political status of tribal nations.",
      "\u201cI made it very clear, we are not DEI \u2014 as tribal nations, as a political entity,\" he said.",

      "A woman in Australia unknowingly gave birth to a stranger's baby after an IVF clinic mistakenly transferred the wrong embryo, the clinic said",

      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",

      "The Vatican is opening the most solemn period of Holy Week with a recovering Pope Francis largely on the sidelines",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican on Thursday opened the most solemn period of Holy Week with a recovering Pope Francis largely on the sidelines, as cardinals were designated to take his place presiding over the most important liturgical services leading up to Easter.",
      "The 88-year-old Francis, who survived a life-threatening bout of double pneumonia this winter, is expected to make some appearances, however. He made a surprise cameo at the end of Palm Sunday Mass last weekend and in recent days has made some unannounced visits \u2014 including one in which he wasn\u2019t dressed in his papal white cassock \u2014 to pray in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and St. Mary Major basilica across town.",
      "By all indications he is continuing to improve after his five-week hospital stay and is slowly resuming some of his normal activities. In recent outings, he has been seen without the nasal tubes that provide supplemental oxygen and Vatican officials say he is increasingly less reliant on the therapy.",
      "On Wednesday, Francis held his first formal group audience since returning to the Vatican on March 23, meeting with the medical staff of the Gemelli hospital who cared for him during his 38-day stay. Gathered in a Vatican audience hall, Francis thanked the 70-plus doctors, nurses and administrators and asked them for their continued prayers.",
      "\u201cThank you for everything you did,\u201d Francis said, his voice still labored but seemingly stronger as he continues respiratory and physical therapy.",
      "He gave special thanks to the rector of Gemelli\u2019s affiliated Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Elena Beccalli, whom he praised for her strong leadership. \u201cWhen women command, things go well,\u201d he said in his longest public remarks since his hospitalization.",
      "Francis has delegated the demanding Holy Week liturgical celebrations to hand-picked cardinals, but the Vatican says the pope himself composed the meditations that will be read aloud by others during the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession on Friday night at Rome\u2019s Colosseum.",
      "The Holy Thursday Mass, for example, during which the oils used in liturgical rituals throughout the year are blessed, was being celebrated by the retired head of the Vatican\u2019s patrimony office, Cardinal Domenico Calcagno. Friday\u2019s solemn commemoration of the crucifixion of Christ was assigned to Cardinal Claudio Gugerotti, who heads the Vatican office in charge of eastern rite Catholics. Easter Sunday was assigned to the retired administrator of St. Peter\u2019s, Cardinal Angelo Comastri.",
      "It remains to be seen how Francis will handle Easter Sunday\u2019s traditional \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d speech and blessing (Latin for \u201cto the city and the world\u201d). Normally the pope delivers a sometimes lengthy discourse on the state of the world from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s, and then imparts a special blessing to the faithful in the piazza below. In theory someone else could read the speech while Francis could impart the blessing.",
      "Francis was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 with bronchitis that quickly developed into a life-threatening case of double pneumonia. Upon his release March 23, doctors proscribed two months of convalescence at the Vatican with daily respiratory and physical therapy to improve his breathing and vocal function. With time, they have predicted he will be able to resume his normal activities.",

      "CAIRO -- Egypt's revenue from the Suez Canal plunged by almost two thirds last year, officials said Wednesday, attributing the sharp drop to regional tensions and wars in the Middle East that have impacted traffic through the key waterway.",
      "The canal is a major source of foreign currency for the Egyptian government, with about 10% of world trade flowing through the waterway in recent years.",
      "The Suez Canal Authority, which runs the waterway, said the canal generated an annual revenue of $3.991 billion in 2024, down from a historic high of $10.25 billion in 2023, according to a statement posted on its Facebook page.",
      "Canal traffic has been significantly disrupted after Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels started to threaten maritime trade and targeting vessels heading to Israel through the Suez Canal to pressure Israel to stop the war in Gaza, which started on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2024, the Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two ships and killing four sailors. The rebels insisted the attacks would continue as long as the wars go on and have devastated shipping through the region.",
      "According to the Egyptian canal authority, only 13,213 ships passed through the canal in 2024, marking a 50% decline compared to the number of ships in 2023, when over 26,000 ships passed through.",

      "An island-wide blackout has hit Puerto Rico as the largely Catholic residents of the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- An island-wide blackout hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the largely Catholic residents of the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate the Easter weekend, a power company spokesman said.",
      "All 1.4 million clients on the island were without power, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe entire island is without generation,\u201d he said.",
      "It was not immediately clear what caused the shutdown, the latest in a string of major blackouts on the island in recent years. Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez, who was traveling, said officials were \u201cworking diligently\u201d to address the outage.",
      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "The last island-wide blackout occurred on New Year\u2019s Eve. Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greece on Wednesday announced plans for managing human activities in maritime areas, such as tourism, offshore energy drilling, fishing and environmental protection, irking neighboring Turkey, which said the plans encroach on its jurisdiction.",
      "The announcement about Greece\u2019s Maritime Spatial Planning came after the country was rebuked by the European Court of Justice earlier this year for failing to submit the plans to the European Commission, as all coastal European Union member states are required to do. Spatial planning for sea areas is considered necessary for the sustainable use of marine resources, setting out where activities such as transport, tourism, fishing and renewable energy projects can take place, and for the protection of marine environments.",

      "Greece\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the Maritime Spatial Planning was separate from the delineation of the exclusive economic zone. In a series of explanatory notes posted on its website, the Foreign Ministry said it still aimed to maintain dialogue with Turkey.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Migrants from Bangladesh, Colombia, Morocco and Tunisia are unlikely to be granted asylum in Europe and should have their applications fast-tracked so they can be sent home more quickly, the European Union\u2019s executive branch said Wednesday.",
      "The European Commission said that seven countries \u2013 also including Egypt, India and Kosovo \u2013 should be designated as \u201csafe third countries.\u201d Applications by their citizens for international protection in Europe would be wrapped up in three months rather than the usual six.",
      "In total, more than 200,000 people from these countries applied for asylum last year.",
      "A year ago, EU nations endorsed sweeping reforms to the bloc\u2019s failed asylum system. The rules were meant to resolve the issues that have divided the 27 countries since well over 1 million migrants swept into Europe in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.",

      "MARIENBERG, Germany -- U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to become a tough nut to crack in an unlikely place \u2014 a small company whose factory nestled deep in the hills of eastern Germany produces painstakingly hand-crafted nutcrackers that are snapped up by American collectors.",
      "Alongside classic fare such as a variety of Santas, Scrooge and the Mad Hatter, specifically American-themed and event-related collectibles are a staple at Steinbach Volkskunst. There's Uncle Sam, the Statue of Liberty, Mickey Mouse and a coronation-themed tribute to Britain's King Charles III among many others.",
      "This week, a limited-edition creation titled \u201cResolute Desk of the President,\u201d featuring a seated Trump-like figure signing a \u201cpresidential proclamation,\u201d is taking shape at Steinbach's factory on the edge of the small town of Marienberg, near the Czech border.",
      "A nutcracker typically takes around a week to produce as its wooden parts are turned, painted, dried, assembled and in many cases dressed in a costume. In this case, the president's blond mane is combed and given a shot of hairspray as a finishing touch. The price tag is over $300, fairly typical for the more elaborate of the company's smaller-scale nutcrackers.",
      "For a firm that exports more than 95% of its products and sells more than 90% of what it makes in the United States, Trump's tariffs are a significant potential headache. The U.S. initially imposed a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union \u2014 in which Germany, better known for industries such as auto manufacturing \u2014 has the biggest economy. But the administration suspended that for 90 days while leaving a baseline 10% tariff in place.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, \u201cwe were able to think through various scenarios and think about what would happen or not, but I think that ultimately everyone was somehow caught cold,\u201d owner and manager Rico Paul says. \u201cBut it's the same for everyone ... so we all have to cope with it.\u201d",
      "Steinbach, with about 35 manufacturing employees and five in office functions, produces 30,000-40,000 items a year and, according to Paul, could sell many more than that. He says the company is lucky to have many longstanding wholesale customers who placed their orders in January for nutcrackers to be delivered throughout the year until Christmas, lessening the immediate concerns.",
      "\u201cThere are no direct effects for us yet,\u201d Paul says. \u201cNo customer has canceled his order, but we will see next year whether the prices have perhaps become too expensive and there is less demand.\u201d",
      "The manager says Steinbach is considering whether to set up a logistics facility in the U.S. and employ people there to ship in goods and offer corporate customers its products from inside the country, so that they don't have to deal with the tariffs.",
      "There are limits to what the company can change. Craft from the Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, around Marienberg is an institution in itself and last month was added to a list vetted by a German sub-committee of the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO, as an \u201cexample of good practice of the conservation of immaterial cultural heritage.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a \u2018made in Germany\u2019 product and that is also important to the collector,\u201d Paul says. \u201cThat means we will never relocate production.\u201d",
      "The focus on the U.S. market also is deeply embedded in the company's history and goes back nearly 80 years. The Steinbach family had to give up its factory in what became communist East Germany after World War II and started over near Hanover, in the west. The nutcrackers became a popular souvenir for American troops stationed in Germany, and family head Christian Steinbach made a concerted effort to build up the U.S. market.",
      "The company moved back to the Erzgebirge after Germany was reunited in 1990. It fell on hard times after Christian Steinbach died in 2008 and the financial crisis hit. Paul took over and revived the firm after it filed for bankruptcy a decade ago, and he's counting on America even now.",
      "\u201cWe're very positive because we have built up these customer relationships over decades, deliver reliably and have more demand than we can produce every year,\u201d he says, adding that the company will \u201ckeep faith with America.\u201d",
      "During last year's election campaign, Steinbach produced limited-edition nutcrackers representing Trump and opponent Kamala Harris. The Republican sold out; the Democrat didn't entirely.",
      "The company has added a tongue-in-cheek plea for tariff clemency to the president's desk in its latest creation.",
      "The proclamation being signed by \u201cMr. President\u201d is headed \u201cRecognition of Steinbach Nutcrackers as Essential Cultural Heritage\u201d",
      "\u201cI hereby declare the nutcrackers of Steinbach Volkskunst to be an essential infrastructure asset of the United States,\u201d it says. \u201cEffective immediately, all Steinbach nutcrackers shall be exempt from all tariffs and taxes \u2014 for life.\u201d",

      "The World Health Organization's member countries agreed on a draft pandemic treaty that sets guidelines for how the international community might face the next global health crisis",
      "LONDON -- Five years after COVID-19 triggered national lockdowns, economic uncertainty and killed millions, the World Health Organization\u2019s member countries agreed on a draft \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d that sets guidelines for how the international community might confront the next global health crisis.",
      "After the world\u2019s largely disastrous response to the coronavirus, countries tasked the WHO with overseeing a pandemic treaty in 2021; negotiations concluded early Wednesday on an agreement expected to be adopted next month at the U.N. health agency's annual meeting in Geneva.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus heralded it as a historic moment, saying countries have proven that \u201cin our divided world, nations can still work together to find common ground and a shared response.\u201d",
      "Following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the country from the WHO in January, American officials were barred from participating in the talks and are not expected to sign the treaty. During COVID-19, it was largely American research and development that produced the most effective vaccines and medicines.",
      "Weeks after Trump\u2019s decision, Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei also exited the WHO, citing \u201cprofound differences\u201d with the U.N. agency.",
      "Rachael Crockett, of the advocacy group Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, described the draft pandemic treaty as \u201ca product of compromise.\u201d She said it contained strong provisions, but only if countries chose to implement them. \u201cThis could change what we saw in COVID, when some populations didn\u2019t get access to what they needed.\u201d",
      "The draft treaty notably includes a provision to guarantee that countries that share critical virus samples receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines, with the WHO to hold up to 20% of such products to ensure poorer countries get supplies. Negotiations on this provision are expected to continue after the treaty is likely accepted by member countries in May.",
      "Crockett acknowledged that as is often the case with international law, there are few consequences for countries that don\u2019t comply: \u201cThere\u2019s not much that can be done if countries choose not to ratify or abide by it.\u201d",
      "Yuanqiong Hu, of aid organization Doctors Without Borders, said that if disputes arise between countries, the treaty includes a mechanism for them to use diplomatic channels, followed by arbitration.",
      "Countries are already legally bound by the International Health Regulations to do things like quickly report dangerous new outbreaks. But those have been flouted repeatedly, including by African countries during Ebola and other outbreaks, China in the early stages of COVID-19 and arguably the U.S. amid its ongoing bird flu epidemic.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran 's president formally approved the resignation of one of his vice presidents who served as Tehran's key negotiator in its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, just as the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog was due to arrive in the Islamic Republic on Wednesday.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian's announcement late Tuesday regarding Mohammad Javad Zarif comes as Iran prepares for a second round of negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "Meanwhile, the visit by Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, scheduled to start Wednesday may include negotiations over just what access his inspectors can get under any proposed deal.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn\u2019t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Zarif served as a key supporter of Pezeshkian in his election last year but drew criticism from hard-liners within Iran's Shiite theocracy, who long have alleged Zarif gave away too much in negotiations.",
      "In March, Zarif tendered his resignation to Pezeshkian. However, the president did not immediately respond to the letter. Zarif has used resignation announcements in the past in his political career as leverage, including in a dispute last year over the composition of Pezeshkian\u2019s Cabinet. The president had rejected that resignation.",
      "But on late Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said Pezeshkian wrote Zarif a letter praising him but accepting his resignation.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian emphasized that due to certain issues, his administration can no longer benefit from Zarif\u2019s valuable knowledge and expertise,\u201d a statement from the presidency said.",
      "The president in a decree appointed Mohsen Ismaili, 59, to be his new vice president for strategic affairs. In Iran's political system, the president has multiple vice presidents. Ismaili is known as a political moderate and a legal expert.",
      "Grossi meanwhile was due to arrive in Tehran and have meetings with Pezeshkian and others.",
      "Since the nuclear deal\u2019s collapse in 2018 with Trump's unilateral withdraw of the U.S. from the accord, Iran has abandoned all limits on its program, and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity \u2014 near weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that they could pursue atomic weapons, something the West and the IAEA have been worried about for years since Tehran abandoned an organized weapons program in 2003.",
      "Any possible deal between Iran and the U.S. likely would need to rely on the IAEA's expertise to ensure Tehran's compliance. And despite tensions between Iran and the agency, its access has not been entirely revoked.",
      "It remains unclear where the next round of talks will be held, though they are scheduled for Saturday. Officials initially identified Rome as hosting the negotiations, only for Iran to insist early Tuesday they would return to Oman. American officials so far haven\u2019t said where the talks will be held, though Trump did call Oman\u2019s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq on Tuesday while the ruler was on a trip to the Netherlands.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Wednesday warned the U.S. about taking contradictory stances in the talks.",
      "That likely refers to comments from U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who this week initially suggested a deal could see Iran go back to 3.67% uranium enrichment \u2014 like in the 2015 deal reached by the Obama administration. Witkoff then followed up with saying \"a deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d",

      "Araghchi warned America about taking any \u201ccontradictory and opposing stances\u201d in the talks.",
      "\u201cEnrichment is a real and accepted issue, and we are ready for trust building about possible concerns,\" Araghchi said. But losing the right to enrich at all \"is not negotiable.\u201d",

      "The doctor was part of a nursing service\u2019s end-of-life care team and was initially suspected in the deaths of just four patients. That number has crept higher since last summer, and investigators now say they've found evidence linking him to the deaths of 15 people between September 22, 2021, and July 24 last year.",
      "The victims' ages ranged from 25 to 94. Most died in their own homes.",
      "He allegedly administered an anesthetic and a muscle relaxer to the patients without their knowledge or consent. The drug cocktail then allegedly paralyzed the respiratory muscles. Respiratory arrest and death followed within minutes, prosecutors said.",
      "The doctor \u2014 a 40-year-old man whose name hasn't been released, in line with German privacy rules \u2014 has been in custody since Aug. 6. Prosecutors said Wednesday that he has not yet responded to the case against him.",
      "The charges were filed to the Berlin state court, which will now have to decide whether to bring the case to trial and if so, when.",
      "Murder charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. Prosecutors said they aim to ask the court to establish that the suspect bears particularly severe guilt, meaning that he wouldn\u2019t be eligible for release after 15 years as is usually the case in Germany. They also want him to be banned from his profession for life.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Israel\u2019s defense minister said Wednesday that troops will remain in so-called security zones in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria indefinitely, remarks that could further complicate talks with Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli strikes across Gaza meanwhile killed another 22 people, according to local health officials, including a girl who was not yet a year old. The girl\u2019s mother, who was wounded, embraced her daughter, still wearing a bloodied blue dress, before she was taken for burial.",
      "Israeli forces have taken over more than half of Gaza in a renewed campaign to pressure Hamas to release hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire last month. Israel has also refused to withdraw from some areas in Lebanon following a ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group last year, and it seized a buffer zone in southern Syria after rebels overthrew President Bashar Assad in December.",
      "\u201cUnlike in the past, the (Israeli military) is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. The military \u201cwill remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and (Israeli) communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza \u2014 as in Lebanon and Syria.\u201d",

      "Two Israeli drones strikes on Wednesday in southern Lebanon killed two people, the health ministry said. The U.N. said Israeli strikes in Lebanon have killed more than 70 civilians since the ceasefire took effect in November.",
      "Hamas has said it will not release dozens of remaining hostages without a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThey promised that the hostages come first. In practice, Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages,\" the main organization representing families of the hostages said in a statement. \u201cThere is one solution that is desirable and feasible, and that is the release of all the hostages at once as part of an agreement, even at the cost of ending the war.\"",
      "Israel says it must maintain control of what it refers to as security zones to prevent a repeat of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which thousands of militants stormed into southern Israel from Gaza, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "Associated Press footage showed the mother, wrapped in bandages, cradling her daughter one last time in the hospital bed.",
      "Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas. The grandfather said there were no militants in the area of the strike. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
      "The family had fled to Khan Younis from the southern city of Rafah after Israel renewed its offensive last month. \u201cWherever you go, death will catch up with you. There is no escape,\u201d the grandfather said.",

      "Israel's bombardment and ground operations have left vast areas of the territory uninhabitable and have displaced around 90% of the population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. Many have been displaced multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps with dwindling food after Israel sealed off the territory from all imports more than a month ago.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to annihilate Hamas and return the 59 hostages still in Gaza \u2014 24 believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of hostage Rom Braslavski, likely filmed under duress, in which he said he was covered in sores and pleaded with Netanyahu to stop the war.",

      "Palestinians and Arab countries have universally rejected Trump\u2019s proposal, which human rights experts say would likely violate international law. Palestinians in Gaza say they don\u2019t want to leave, and fear another mass expulsion like the one that occurred during the war surrounding Israel\u2019s creation in 1948.",
      "The Trump administration, which took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire, has expressed full support for Israel's decision to end it and to cut off all humanitarian aid.

      "The world\u2019s two largest economies have been steadily increasing tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. China faces 145% taxes on exports to the U.S., while dozens of other countries were given a 90-day reprieve for most duties.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, China announced its economy expanded at a 5.4% annual pace in January-March, supported by strong exports. Analysts are forecasting that the world\u2019s second largest economy will slow significantly in coming months, however, as tariffs on U.S. imports from China take effect.",
      "Exports were a strong factor in China\u2019s 5% annual growth rate in 2024, and the official target for this year is also about 5%.",

But as China\u2019s domestic consumption continues to languish, it will be difficult to replace the U.S. consumer.",

      "LONDON -- The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the U.K. equalities law defines a woman as someone born biologically female.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said five judges at the court had ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018sex\u2019 in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "The ruling means that a transgender person with a certificate that recognizes them as female should not be considered a woman for equality purposes.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament stating that there should be a 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. That law included transgender women in its definition of women.",

      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament stating that there should be a 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. That law included transgender women in its definition of women.",
      "The women's rights group successfully challenged that law, arguing that its redefinition of \u201cwoman\u201d went beyond parliament's powers.",
      "Scottish officials then issued guidance stating that the definition of \u201cwoman\u201d included a transgender woman with a gender recognition certificate.",
      "FWS sought to overturn that.",
      "\u201cNot tying the definition of sex to its ordinary meaning means that public boards could conceivably comprise of 50% men, and 50% men with certificates, yet still lawfully meet the targets for female representation,\" the group\u2019s director Trina Budge said.",
      "The challenge was rejected by a court in 2022, but the group was granted permission last year to take its case to the Supreme Court.",
      "Aidan O\u2019Neill, a lawyer for FWS, told the Supreme Court judges \u2014 three men and two women \u2014 that under the Equality Act \u201csex\u201d should refer to biological sex and as understood \u201cin ordinary, everyday language.\u201d",

It is an immutable biological state.\u201d",

The \u201cHarry Potter\u201d writer has been vocal in arguing that the rights for trans women should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "Opponents, including Amnesty International, said excluding transgender people from sex discrimination protections conflicts with human rights.",
      "Amnesty submitted a brief in court saying it was concerned about the deterioration of the rights for trans people in the U.K. and abroad.",
      "\u201cA blanket policy of barring trans women from single-sex services is not a proportionate means to achieve a legitimate aim,\u201d the human rights group said.",

      "Around 80 students who set off on bicycles 13 days ago on a journey to Strasbourg, France, were aiming to draw EU attention to their monthslong protests against corruption in the Balkan nation. Serbia is formally seeking membership in the 27-nation bloc but has been backsliding in democratic freedoms and the rule of law.",

      "They braved heavy rain and chilling temperatures along their journey across Europe that included a hero's welcome by supporters in Budapest, Vienna and in German towns.",
      "The student-led protests in Serbia were triggered by the deaths of 16 people in a deadly train station canopy collapse in November, widely blamed on rampant corruption. They have since come to reflect wider discontent with the state of democratic freedoms in Serbia.",
      "The protesting students have been demanding justice for the victims of the Nov. 1 canopy collapse and an end to government pressure and violence against protesters.",

      "The EU\u2019s reaction to the mostly peaceful student-led protests has been lukewarm and officials have refrained from criticizing Vucic. They apparently consider him a key factor in maintaining peace in a region that went through a series of devastating wars in the 1990s.",
      "In Strasbourg, the students plan to visit the Council of Europe and the European Parliament.",
      "Since coming to power over a decade ago, Vucic has been accused of stifling democratic freedoms while maintaining close links with Russia and China.",
      "In Serbia on Tuesday, student-led protesters temporarily blocked the entrances to Vucic's main propaganda TV broadcaster RTS in Belgrade and the northern town of novi sad to protest its coverage of the events.",

      "Cocoa has long provided a lifeline in Ivory Coast but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years",
      "N'GATTAKRO, Ivory Coast -- Jean Mari Konan Yao says he's struggling as a cocoa farmer in the west African nation of Ivory Coast, which produces almost half the world\u2019s cocoa supply of the raw ingredient used in chocolate.",
      "Like many in Ivory Coast \u2014 the world's biggest cocoa producer \u2014 Konan Yao says cocoa has long provided a lifeline for him, but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years.",
      "Now, cocoa farmers worry even more over President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose a 21% tariff on products from Ivory Coast \u2014 the highest among West African nations.",
      "Although Trump has suspended the tariff plans for 90 days pending further review, authorities in Ivory Coast have warned that such tariffs could send the price of cocoa even higher and destabilize the local market by slowing their sales.",
      "Ivory Coast produces between 2 million and 2.5 million metric tons of cocoa annually, with around 200,000 to 300,000 metric tons exported to the United States, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Council.",
      "In 2023, Ivory Coast exported $3.68 billion worth of cocoa beans, its second biggest export after gold. The U.S. was its fourth-largest importer of cocoa beans, after the Netherlands, Malaysia and Belgium, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "For most local cocoa growers, any U.S. tariff could further shake a market already struggling with decreasing yields and shrinking funding that has limited farmers\u2019 ability to meet global demands for chocolate.",
      "\u201cIf we hear the American president is going to put a tax on the price of cocoa, it\u2019s really not good for us, it doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d said another cocoa farmer, Salif Traor\u00e9.",
      "Already, cocoa prices were rising in the country, in part because of insufficient and irregular rainfall in Ivory Coast.",
      "The U.K.-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research firm has noted a 32% rise in the price of cocoa imported into the United Kingdom over the last three years, partially due to extreme weather conditions in parts of Africa where it\u2019s mainly grown. Together, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon produce about three-quarters of the world\u2019s cocoa.",
      "Cocoa is traded on a regulated, global market. In Ivory Coast, the government usually sets cocoa prices at the onset of each season, with prices reflecting market trends and global prices. The local prices are, however, lower than the global market rates, thereby limiting the farmers' profit from high global prices.",
      "Authorities say they are already considering cocoa price increases if the U.S. tariff comes into effect.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s customs tax is causing us problems. We are already feeling the effects,\u201d said Boss Diarra, coordinator of the local cocoa farmers\u2019 union in Bouafl\u00e9 in central Ivory Coast. He pointed to bags of cocoa that he said farmers have been unable to sell.",
      "Meanwhile, a U.S. tariff could mean more cocoa for European markets, said Bruno Marcel Iriti\u00e9, researcher at the Ivorian F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Polytechnic Institute. Some of the top importers of Ivory Coast cocoa are in Europe, market data show.",
      "European customers \"will inevitably buy cheaper because when there is too much, the customer is king,\u201d Iriti\u00e9 said.",

      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as an EU facilitator when she meets with Donald Trump in the White House",
      "MILAN -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as a bridge between the EU and the United States when she meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, the first European leader to have a face-to-face with Trump since he announced, and then suspended, 20% tariffs on European exports.",
      "Meloni secured the meeting at a critical juncture in the trade war as Italy\u2019s leader, but she also has, in a sense, been \u201cknighted\u201d to represent the European Union. She has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the trip, and \"the outreach is \u2026 closely coordinated,\" a commission spokeswoman said this week.",
      "\u201cWe know we are in a difficult moment,\" Meloni said this week in Rome. \"Most certainly, I am well aware of what I represent, and what I am defending.\"",
      "The European Union is defending what it calls \u201cthe most important commercial relationship in the world,\u2019\u2019 with annual trade reaching 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion).",
      "Trade negotiations fall under the European Commission\u2019s authority, which is pushing for a zero-for-zero tariff deal with the U.S. However, Trump administration officials in talks with the EU have yet to publicly show signs of relenting on Trump\u2019s insistence that a baseline 10% tariff be charged on all foreign imports. He paused for 90 days a retaliatory increase to 20%.",
      "The pause has raised some hopes for negotiations, and Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in gaining clarity on Trump's goals rather than outright concessions, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is a very delicate mission,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Center think tank in Brussels. \u201cThere is the whole trade agenda, and while she\u2019s not officially negotiating, we know that Trump likes to have this kind of informal exchange, which in a sense is a negotiation. So it\u2019s a lot on her plate.\"",
      "As the leader of a far-right party, Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues including curbing migration, promoting traditional values and skepticism toward multilateral institutions. But stark differences have emerged in Meloni\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine.",
      "After being the only European leader to attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni has responded with studied restraint as abrupt shifts in U.S. policy under Trump have frayed the trans-Atlantic alliance. She has denounced the tariffs as \"wrong\" and warned that \u201cdividing the West would be disastrous for everyone,\u201d after Trump\u2019s heated White House exchange with Ukraine\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cShe has been very cautious,\u2019\u2019 said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at the London-based Teneo consultancy. \u201cIt is what we need when we have a counterpart that is changing every day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Italy maintains a 40 billion euro trade surplus with the United States, its largest with any country, fueled by Americans\u2019 appetite for Italian sparkling wine, foodstuffs like Parmigiano Reggiano hard cheese and Parma ham, and Italian luxury fashion. These are all sectors critical to the Italian economy, and mostly supported by small- and medium-sized producers who are core center-right voters.",
      "\u201cAll in all, I think she will focus on the very strong economic and trade relations that Italy has with the United States, not just in terms of exports, but also services and energy,\" said Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the ISPI think tank in Milan. \u201cFor example, Italy could even consider importing more gas from the U.S.\u201d",
      "The meeting comes against the backdrop of growing concerns over global uncertainty generated by the escalating tariff wars. Italy\u2019s growth forecast for this year has already been slashed from 1% to 0.5% as a result.",
      "Meloni is also expected to address Trump's demand for NATO partners to increase military spending to 2% of gross domestic product. Italy\u2019s spending, at 1.49% of GDP, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "Experts cautioned, however, against raising expectations over any concrete progress.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy has been to be very circumspect: Get there, get the meeting, get the photo opportunity,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cIf she is able to come back, and give a sense of how Washington wants to frame future relations on trade, defense and Ukraine policy, that would be a huge win.\"",

      "Alico, Inc. said it has filed a development application for the first of two villages near the intersection of Collier, Lee and Hendry counties. Each village will have about 4,500 homes and will be integrated with 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) of protected conservation land, the company said.",
      "The Fort Myers-based company owns 53,371 acres (21,600 hectares) across eight counties in Florida and 48,700 acres (19,700 hectares) of oil, gas and mineral rights in the state.

      "President Donald Trump joined his economic advisers for White House negotiations Wednesday over tariffs and trade with a Japanese official",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.",
      "The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.",
      "\u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.",
      "Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course the talks are not easy, but President Trump stated his intention to make this negotiation a top priority,\u201d Ishiba said. \u201cI believe we had talks that lead to a next step.\u201d",
      "Ishiba said he will closely watch how ministerial talks go and plans to visit Washington to meet with Trump at an appropriate time.",
      "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.",
      "The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",
      "The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.",
      "With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.",
      "U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.",
      "Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.",
      "On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.",
      "Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.",
      "\u201cThe level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.",
      "Although Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.",
      "Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.",
      "\u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday.",
      "Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.",
      "Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks.",
      "Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs' uncertainty but that he's also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China.",
      "\u201cIn the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical ... confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,\u201d Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",
      "\u201cTogether, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family,\u201d he added.",

      "Under its national security strategy, Japan aims to double annual defense spending to nearly $10 trillion, or 2% of GDP, in 2027, while there is a concern that Trump may ask for that to be increased to 3% of GDP. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday that the military budget for this year is about 1.8% of Japan\u2019s GDP.",

      "This is the time of year when many parents are thinking about buying a used vehicle for their teen drivers. The vehicle may be a graduation gift or a needed set of wheels for a summer job or trip to college. These days, SUVs are a common choice because of their sales popularity. But which one to get?",
      "Edmunds\u2019 auto experts have rounded up five used SUV recommendations for your teen driver. We considered Edmunds\u2019 evaluations of helpful qualities for teen drivers such as outward visibility, technology features and driving satisfaction. We also considered reliability data and crash test results. Here are Edmunds\u2019 top picks for $20,000 or less. The prices listed are estimates of what you might expect to pay at a nationwide dealership such as CarMax or Carvana.",
      "The last-generation Equinox is a top compact SUV value. It\u2019s affordably priced and has roomy seating, a smooth ride and useful tech features. The standard Teen Driver feature, for example, can remind young drivers to buckle up, and it limits stereo volume and lets parents monitor driving habits. Downmarket interior quality and small cargo space narrow the Equinox\u2019s appeal, but overall the Equinox is a no-nonsense choice.",
      "Look for: Picking an Equinox is pretty easy because it didn\u2019t change much from 2018 to 2024. There\u2019s a lot of Equinox inventory to pick from too. Consider a 2019-and-later model to get a newer infotainment system.",
      "2018-2022 Equinox pricing: approximately $14,000 to $20,000",
      "Lively handling and a high-quality interior make the Mazda CX-5 a fun compact SUV. And while sporty performance isn\u2019t a priority for most parents, going with a CX-5 will neatly circumvent any complaints about an SUV being boring to drive. Other high points include excellent crash test safety ratings and a high predicted RepairPal reliability score. Rear seat and cargo space come up short compared to rivals, but the CX-5 remains an excellent choice.",
      "Look for: Mazda made some improvements during this time. Young drivers will likely appreciate the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration that became standard in 2019.",
      "2017-2020 CX-5 pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Is your teen an outdoorsy type? Someone who enjoys camping, surfing, snowboarding or biking? The half-wagon, half-SUV Outback shines here. It has standard all-wheel drive for sure-footed traction in rough or wet terrain. Tall ground clearance lets it go places sportier SUVs can\u2019t, while its lower roof height makes for easy cargo loading. The Outback also gets excellent safety scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",
      "Look for: Subaru redesigned the Outback for 2020, but we think an older Outback is just as good. Subaru made more advanced safety aids, including automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, standard starting in 2019.",
      "2015-2018 Outback pricing: approximately $15,000 to $20,000",
      "Your teen driver needs a larger three-row SUV? Consider an older Highlander. The third row isn\u2019t palatial, but it\u2019s handy enough for a teen who might need to shuttle siblings around. The third row also folds down to create ample cargo space. Crash test scores and predicted RepairPal reliability are favorable too. The biggest complaint your teen might have is that a Highlander is just too sensible and boring.",
      "Look for: the four-cylinder gets the job done, Highlanders with the more powerful V6 are better at accelerating quickly with multiple passengers aboard.",
      "2015-2016 Highlander pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Like the Outback, the Wrangler isn\u2019t quite an SUV, truck or wagon. It\u2019s its own category. Yes, a four-door Wrangler lacks much of what other SUVs offer. It\u2019s bouncy, loud, gulps fuel and hardly impresses in crash test safety or RepairPal reliability. But its emotional appeal is undeniable. From its legendary off-road capability, and removable doors and roof, the Wrangler scratches a teenage itch for freedom like no other.",
      "Look for: There are two-door and four-door versions of the Wrangler; young drivers will likely enjoy the more personal vibe of the two-door. Regardless of type, the Sport or Sport S trims offer the best combination of features, fun and frugality.",
      "2015-2016 Wrangler pricing: approximately $17,000 to $20,000",
      "Whether your teen driver likes the outdoors, motorsports or simply having enough space for friends and family, there are several good choices for a used SUV to suit your teen\u2019s needs and style.",

      "Inflation in the U.K. fell for the second month running in March largely as a result of lower prices at the pump, a move that is likely to pile pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates next month",
      "LONDON -- Inflation in the United Kingdom fell for the second month running in March largely as a result of lower prices at the pump, official figures showed Wednesday, a move that is likely to pile pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates next month.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose by 2.6% in the year to March, down from 2.8% the previous month. The decline was bigger than anticipated, with most economists predicting a more modest decline to 2.7%.",
      "However, inflation remains above the Bank of England's target of 2% and is set to rise to over 3% in April due to a confluence of factors, including higher domestic energy bills as well as the potential impact of higher taxes and labor costs for businesses, which are likely to pass some costs on to customers.",
      "Still, most economists think the bank can lower its main interest rate from 4.50%, as the peak in inflation is likely to be lower than previously thought, not least because U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are likely to depress global growth and hence prices. One impact of Trump's tariff plans has been lower oil prices, which will have a downward effect on inflation.",
      "\u201cAn interest rate cut in May looks increasingly nailed on, and the path to more easing in the second half of the year is getting clearer,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks have dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.",
      "As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.",
      "The Bank of England has lowered its main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February,",

      "Making maple syrup in New England\u2019s fickle spring weather can be an unpredictable business",
      "MORGAN, Vt. -- Making maple syrup in New England's fickle spring weather can be an unpredictable business. Now President Donald Trump's ever-changing tariff policies are adding anxiety about an industry that depends on multinational trade.",
      "\u201cAny kind of disruption with our cross border enterprise, we feel it,\u201d said Jim Judd, a fourth-generation sugarer who owns Judd\u2019s Wayeeses Farms in Morgan, Vermont. \u201cIt\u2019s uncertain enough making maple syrup.\u201d",
      "Judd, who has been making Vermont\u2019s signature product since the 1970s, says multiple countries contribute to each container of the sticky sweetener. Stainless steel fixtures used connect sap lines and boil the liquid into syrup can originate in China. Packaging often comes from Italy. And the vast majority of equipment is sold by Canada, which produces about four-fifths of the planet's maple syrup \u2014 and sells nearly two-thirds of it to U.S. consumers.",
      "That's why this spring's whiplash is so concerning to Judd and many other U.S. producers in Vermont as well as New York, Maine and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump backed off the stiffest tariffs on most nations for 90 days earlier this month while increasing the taxes on Chinese imports to 145% and engaging in a lengthy back and forth with Canada and Mexico about tariffs on their countries' goods.",
      "Allison Hope, executive director of the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association, said they're assuming that Trump's latest position means there is no tariff on finished maple products for now \u2014 but the situation gets murkier when considering that necessary packaging, equipment and materials may originate in China.",
      "\u201cIt's like the weather in New England. You wait five minutes and it might change,\u201d Hope said. \u201cNow it matters how Canada makes its equipment and gets its materials. ... It's hard for businesses to run on a growth mentality when there's no sense of what the industry is going to look like in a way, in a year.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty is arriving in a time of relative growth for syrup producers in the U.S. as well as Canada. Vermont has seen an increase in production of nearly 500% over the last 20 years as producers scaled up, new businesses formed and U.S. consumers sought local and natural alternatives to refined sugars, Hope said.",
      "But disrupting trade with Canada, the maple syrup powerhouse, could be devastating. Judd, for one, said he has spent \u201ccountless amounts of hours and lots and lots of money\u201d buying equipment in Canada over the decades. Import taxes could sharply increase his costs, and since syrup is, at essence, a luxury good, he thinks he can't raise prices.",
      "\u201cWe can't do this without Canadian help. We can't buy what we need at another outlet because it's all in Canada,\u201d Judd said. \u201cWe've been crossing this border all my life. The recent changes we see being imposed on the people here \u2014 we're not sure that they're all necessary.\"",

      "A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law has sparked intense backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous organizations",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- A recent amendment to Peru\u2019s Forestry and Wildlife Law is drawing fierce backlash from environmental groups and Indigenous groups that warn it could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest under the guise of economic development.",
      "The amendment eliminates the requirement that landowners or companies get state authorization before converting forested land to other uses. Critics say the change could legitimize years of illegal deforestation.",
      "\u201cTo us, this is gravely concerning,\u201d said Alvaro Masquez Salvador, a lawyer with the Indigenous Peoples program at Peru\u2019s Legal Defense Institute.",
      "Masquez added that the reform sets a troubling precedent by \u201ceffectively privatizing\u201d land that Peru's constitution defines as national patrimony. \u201cForests are not private property\u2014they belong to the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Supporters of the amendment, enacted in March, say it will stabilize Peru\u2019s agricultural sector and provide farmers with greater legal certainty.",
      "The Associated Press sought comment from multiple representatives of Peru\u2019s agribusiness sector, as well as Congresswoman Maria Zeta Chunga, a vocal supporter of the law. Only one person in the agribusiness sector responded, saying they did not want to comment.",
      "Peru holds the second-largest share of Amazon rainforest after Brazil, with over 70 million hectares\u2014about 60% of Peru's territory, according to nonprofit Rainforest Trust. It\u2019s one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and home to more than 50 Indigenous peoples, some living in voluntary isolation. These communities are vital guardians of ecosystems and the rainforests they protect help stabilize the global climate by absorbing large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change.",
      "Passed in 2011, the original Forestry and Wildlife Law required state approval and environmental studies before any change in forest land use. But recent reforms have steadily weakened those protections. The latest amendment allows landowners and companies to bypass that approval, even retroactively legalizing past deforestation.",
      "Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld the amendment after a group of lawyers filed a constitutional challenge. Although the court struck down some parts of the amendment, it left intact the law\u2019s final provision, which validates past illegal land-use changes. Legal experts say this is the most dangerous part.",
      "In its ruling, the court acknowledged that Indigenous communities should have been consulted on reforms to the law and affirmed the Environment Ministry\u2019s role in forest zoning.",
      "Environmental lawyer C\u00e9sar Ipenza summed it up like this: \u201cThe court admits the law violated Indigenous rights and (tribes) should have been consulted but it still endorses the most harmful part.\u201d",
      "The push behind the reform mirrors dynamics seen under former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, where political and economic forces aligned to weaken environmental protections to favor agribusiness. While Brazil\u2019s effort was led by a highly organized, industrial agribusiness lobby, Peru\u2019s version involves a looser but powerful coalition.",
      "In Peru, support comes from agribusiness interests, land grabbers and figures linked to illegal mining and drug trafficking. Small and medium farmers with concerns about securing their land have also been swept into the effort.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a convergence of both legal and illegal interests,\u201d said Vladimir Pinto, the Peru field coordinator for Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "Julia Urrunaga, Peru director at nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency, warned that the Peruvian government is now \u201cfalsely arguing\u201d that the amendments are necessary to comply with the European Union\u2019s regulations, which will soon require companies importing products like soy, beef, and palm oil to prove their goods were not sourced from illegally deforested land.",
      "If products tied to illegal deforestation are later legalized and allowed into the market, that will weaken the effectiveness of demand-side regulations like those in the EU, she said.",
      "\u201cThis sends the wrong message to global markets and undercuts efforts to curb deforestation through trade restrictions,\u201d Urrunaga said.",
      "Olivier Coupleux, head of the Economic and Trade Section of the EU in Peru, has denied that recent changes to the law are linked to the EU\u2019s deforestation-free regulation.",
      "In interviews with Peruvian media, Coupleux has said the regulation aims to prevent the purchase of products linked to deforestation and does not require legal reforms, but rather traceability and sustainability in goods like coffee, cocoa, and timber.",
      "With no further recourse in domestic courts, civil society groups are preparing to take the case to international tribunals, warning that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent for other countries seeking to circumvent environmental law under the banner of reform.",
      "For many Indigenous leaders, the law represents a direct threat to their territories, communities, and ways of life.",
      "Julio Cusurichi, board member of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest, said the measure will embolden land-grabbing and worsen environmental oversight in already vulnerable areas.",
      "\u201cOur communities have historically protected not just our lands but the planet,\u201d Cusurichi said.",

      "Those changes were the result of government decisions that eased price controls on basic goods and allowed consumers and businesses to use greenbacks without restrictions. They also occurred because the government used the Venezuelan Central Bank to inject millions of dollars into the foreign currency exchange market every week and prop up the bolivar.",
      "Those government measures helped end a yearslong cycle of hyperinflation, which had reached 130,000% in 2018. Gross domestic product grew 8% in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund, after the economy shrank about 80% between 2014 and 2020.",
      "Maduro and his government began touting an economic renaissance of sorts. In the capital, Caracas, imported goods stores, restaurants, department stores and other businesses began to pop-up seemingly overnight. The use of ride-hailing and food-delivery apps proliferated. Some families in poor neighborhoods ventured into business ownership operating hot dog carts and other food stands.",
      "But the growth mostly concentrated in Caracas, and communities across the country, including Maracaibo, which prides itself in being the heart of the oil industry, did not see major gains.",
      "\u201cIf you pay more attention to those main avenues\u2026 you\u2019ll see that most of the businesses are closed,\u201d Luis Medina, 21, said pointing to an avenue in downtown Maracaibo. \u201cThere\u2019s a Subway that\u2019s closed, for example, and next to it is a Movistar (cellphone store), which is also closed. Next to it is an international restaurant, El Gaucho, originally from Argentina, which is closed, too.\"",
      "Like people in other Latin American countries \u2013 and long before their nation came undone in 2013 \u2013 Venezuelans have used the U.S. dollar as a safe haven asset and see the exchange rate as a measure of the economy\u2019s health.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government began using cash reserves in 2021 to artificially lower the exchange rate, making people at one point pay 3.50 bolivars for $1. That led to roughly 67% of retail transactions being made in foreign currency.",
      "The rate grew slowly, and by 2023, Maduro\u2019s efforts to inject dollars into the economy were aided by energy giant Chevron, which started regularly selling millions to banks to get bolivars to pay bills after the U.S. government let it to restart operations in Venezuela. The infusion of dollars allowed the government to maintain the rate around 35 bolivars to $1 through mid-2024, when the warnings of economists materialized.",
      "\u201cSo many of us said that \u2026 sooner or later, it was going to be unsustainable,\u201d economics professor Leonardo Vera said. \u201cIt was already evident in July that there were shortages of foreign currency in the official market in the face of growing demand, and those who couldn\u2019t get foreign currency began to move to the black market, a very small market where when a surge in demand arrives\u2026 the price goes up.\u201d",
      "This month, the official rate reached 70 bolivars to $1, but the black market hit 100 bolivars to $1 last month.",
      "Vera explained that factors influencing the price include Maduro\u2019s reelection claim, the results of the U.S. election and the decision of the Trump administration to revoke Chevron\u2019s permit to pump and export Venezuelan oil.",
      "The Biden administration granted Chevron\u2019s permit in late 2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela\u2019s political opposition toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in in January for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes.",
      "Before the official and black market rates grew apart considerably, formal and informal businesses applied the government\u2019s rate for transactions. These days, however, informal businesses, such as the food markets where the majority of Venezuelans buy groceries, favor the black market\u2019s rate, making some goods unaffordable.",
      "Prices have also increased at formal businesses, including grocery and hardware stores, because companies are setting them based on the expected higher cost to replenish their inventories.",
      "Economist Pedro Palma said Venezuela's inflation rate could be between 180% and 200%. He warned that people will cut spending because salaries will not keep up with inflation and some could even lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cWe have a truly dramatic outlook: on the one hand, skyrocketing inflation; on the other, the prospect of a very significant recession,\" Palma said.",
      "Maduro last week sent a decree to the ruling-party controlled National Assembly seeking powers to enact emergency measures to \u201cdefend the national economy,\u201d including suspending tax collections and establishing \u201cmechanisms and percentages for mandatory purchases of national production to promote import substitution.\u201d",
      "He attributed the decision mostly to the impact of the U.S. tariffs on the global economy, but Venezuela\u2019s latest economic troubles predated Trump\u2019s announcement. Weeks earlier, he also announced the shortening of state employees' workweek, effectively giving them ample time to pick up second jobs to complement their approximately $1.65 monthly minimum wage and $100 monthly stipends.",
      "But companies generally are not hiring, and some businesses are now paying employees in bolivars instead of dollars, which has increased the demand for greenbacks in the black market as exchange houses limit the sums available to the public.",
      "The latest economic developments were the greatest fears of many Venezuelans ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election. So much so that a nationwide poll conducted before the election showed that roughly a fourth of people were thinking about migrating, primarily for economic reasons.",
      "Nowadays, though, people largely appear to have abandoned that idea partly because of Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Taxi driver Jonatan Urdaneta has transported migrants from the bus station in Maracaibo to the nearest border crossing with Colombia for two years. For about 18 months, he made two roundtrips a day and so did dozens of other drivers. He can now go a day without a single trip.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s looking very bleak,\u201d Urdaneta, 27, said of his income prospects, standing next to his 1984 Ford sedan. \u201cLet\u2019s hope this improves when God allows.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has taken its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips and products that contain them, chip making equipment and pharmaceuticals",
      "BANGKOK -- The Trump administration has taken its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips, chip making equipment and pharmaceuticals.",
      "The Department of Commerce posted notices about the probes late Monday on the Federal Register, seeking public comment within three weeks. It had not formally announced them earlier.",
      "Although President Donald Trump paused most of his biggest tariff hikes last week for 90 days, apart from those for imports from China, he has said he still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "The Commerce Department said it is investigating how imports of computer chips, equipment to make them and products that contain them \u2014 which include many daily necessities such as cars, refrigerators, smart phones and other items \u2014 affect national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 permits the president to order tariffs for the sake of national security.",
      "The probe includes assessing the potential for U.S. domestic production of computer chips to meet U.S. demand and the role of foreign manufacturing and assembly, testing and packaging in meeting those needs.",
      "Among other aspects of the entire computer chip supply chain, the government intends to also study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on U.S. competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, \u201cforeign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity.\u201d",
      "After Trump said electronics would not be included in what his administration calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs of up to 50% on some nations, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained in an interview on ABC News that pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and autos will be handled with \u201csector specific\u201d tariffs.",
      "\u201cAnd those are not available for negotiation,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThey are just going to be part of making sure we reshore the core national security items that need to be made in this country. We need to make medicine in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make semiconductors.\u201d",
      "The investigation into pharmaceutical imports includes ingredients used to make such drugs and touches on many of the same aspects of relying on imports to make them.",
      "Asked about his plans for more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Trump said Monday, \u201cYeah, we're going to be doing that.\u201d",
      "He said it would be in the \u201cnot too distant future.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we want to make our own drugs,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 70% of the materials, or active pharmaceutical ingredients, used to make medicines made in the United States are produced in other countries, with India, the European Union and China leading suppliers. The U.S. produces about a fifth of all pharmaceuticals made worldwide, but consumes about 45%, far more than any other country.",
      "The U.S. also is a major producer of semiconductors, but only in some areas. It relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for certain kinds of advanced chips. In particular, Taiwan dominates advanced logic chip production at 92% of all fabrication capacity according to the International Trade Administration, with South Korea making 8%.",
      "Products like laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year. The administration's plans suggest that such electronics will still be taxed by previous (non-\u201creciprocal\u201d) tariffs \u2014 and potentially under additional, sector-specific levies.",
      "Although major computer chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. are investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing facilities, partly due to incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden's time in office, the costly process of changing entire supply chains would take years.",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department said Monday that it was withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico, effective in 90 days. It said the current arrangement failed to protect U.S. growers from \u201cunfairly priced\u201d imports of tomatoes. Most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff, it said.",

      "If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension",
      "NEW YORK -- If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes that you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension beyond the normal filing deadline, which is Tuesday.",
      "You're also permitted to write off a certain amount of loss due to disaster, reducing your tax burden. That could be damaged property, lost income, or small business losses.",
      "\u201cIt can feel really daunting and overwhelming, after you\u2019ve already lost your home or your vehicle, to tackle that project (of loss write-off). It can take time and a lot of energy,\u201d said Alison Flores, manager at the Tax Institute for H&R Block. \u201cWe see people be hesitant to tackle that, and so they leave that loss on the table.\u201d",
      "In the wake of a disaster, people are also more vulnerable to scams, so be extra vigilant as you prepare your taxes, even with the extra time of an IRS extension.",
      "\u201cScammers often pose as representatives of the IRS or FEMA to exploit victims of disasters,\u201d said Misty Erickson, tax content program manager at the National Association of Tax Professionals. \u201cCommon scams include false promises of tax refunds, fake charities soliciting donations, and phishing attempts requesting personal or financial information.\u201d",
      "Here's what you should know:",
      "The IRS keeps an official list online of all disaster locations that qualify you for an extension to file.",
      "For the past year, individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton qualify for tax relief, as well as disaster victims in parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Alaska.",
      "Taxpayers in these areas have until May 1 to file returns and make payments, and there's no need to do any additional paperwork to receive that extra two week grace period. Filers also have the option to request additional extensions to October 15, but interest will accrue if any money due isn't paid by May 1.",
      "Individuals and businesses in southern California affected by wildfires and straight-line winds also qualify for automatic extensions due to disaster. Taxpayers in the relevant counties have until Oct. 15 to file returns and make payments.",
      "Any interest or fees that normally accrue on late payments won't accrue during disaster extensions. Most direct disaster relief is also not counted as income, and so is not taxed.",
      "While nothing is easy in the first days and weeks following a disaster, a few choices can help when seeking insurance reimbursement and at tax time.",
      "\u201cWe recommend saving media coverage,\u201d said Flores. \u201cIf your neighborhood was on the news showing the disaster, write down what date that was or record that copy. Anything that substantiates your losses and what condition your property was in is helpful.\u201d",
      "According to the IRS, other steps include:",
      "\u2014 Taking photographs of damaged property or belongings to document and calculate the amount of your loss.",
      "\u2014 Keeping receipts for associated expenses, including contracted work on property damaged by disaster.",
      "\u2014 Keeping records of the original value of any property, including a home, car, jewelry, or big credit card purchases.",
      "Filing your insurance claims as soon as possible is also important, as you deduct any insurance reimbursement from disaster losses claimed on your tax return.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at a loss, it\u2019s often damage to your home, furnishings inside your home, vehicles, that kind of thing,\u201d Flores said. \u201cMost of the time, people will have home insurance and auto insurance, and file claims. That\u2019s the first step. The tax deduction is for loss that\u2019s not paid for or reimbursed by your insurance.\u201d",
      "The IRS calls this kind of disaster relief \u201ccasualty loss.\" Claiming casualty loss doesn't result in dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, but it does lower your tax burden, which can mean more cash to help pay for recovery.",
      "Form 4684, which you include when you file your return, walks you through the relevant steps for calculating your casualty write-off.",
      "Victims of disasters may deduct their losses in either the year they suffered the loss or in the previous year \u2014 in that case, by filing an amended return.",
      "In the wake of a disaster, it's normal to feel vulnerable and to listen to voices that promise relief. But scammers often target disaster victims for exactly this reason.",
      "\u201cTaxpayers should be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from the IRS or relief agencies,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cThe IRS never initiates contact via email, text, or social media to request sensitive information. When in doubt, taxpayers should verify correspondence by calling official numbers directly.\u201d",
      "According to the IRS, you should watch out for:",
      "\u2014 Big paydays: The promise of more money than you think sounds reasonable. Bad advisers may make outlandish statements about available credits.",
      "\u2014 Threats and demands: Any pressure to pay for tax help \u201cnow or else,\u201d mentions of arrest or deportation, or refusals to let you question or appeal the taxes they say you owe.",
      "\u2014 Suspicious or misspelled website links that aren't IRS.gov.",
      "Scammers may say that they want to \u201chelp\u201d you file casualty loss claims or to get big refunds. Always rely on official IRS government websites and beware fishy offers of help with high price-tags or sensational promises.",

      "China's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat President Donald Trump's hefty increases in U.S. tariffs",
      "BANGKOK -- China's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last-minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat increases in U.S. tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, and analysts forecast sharp setbacks ahead.",
      "Imports fell 4.3% to $211.3 billion in March, the customs administration reported, far exceeded by exports worth $313.9 billion, leaving a trade surplus of $102.6 billion.",
      "\u201cBut shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.\u201d",
      "China's trade surplus surged to a record $992.2 billion in 2024 and its exports climbed 5.4%, helping to make up for sluggish growth at home as the country slowly recovers from a crisis in its property market and lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "After taking office, Trump first ordered a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China. He later raised that to 20%. Now, China is facing 145% tariffs on most of its exports to the United States, based on the most recent revisions in Trump\u2019s trade policies. China has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. products and other measures meant to pinch the U.S. where it hurts most, such as controls on exports of critical minerals needed in high-tech manufacturing, such as electric vehicle production.",
      "China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States was $27.6 billion in March as its exports rose 4.5%. It logged a surplus of $76.6 billion with the U.S. in January-March even though exports were up only 2.3% the first two months of the year.",
      "\u201cSavvy U.S. importers likely saw tariff hikes coming in April onward and frontloaded imports,\u201d ING Economics said in a report, but that trend is likely to fall off as importers use up their inventories while they watch for the latest twists and turns in unpredictable U.S. trade policy.",
      "\u201cAs a result, it\u2019s likely that direct trade between the U.S. and China will crater starting in April,\u201d it said.",
      "Trade data already show some impact from the higher tariffs, with exports of lower value-added items like shoes and clothing falling, while shipments of computer chips, household appliances and vehicles surged. China\u2019s biggest exports in the first three months of the year were electronic machinery, a broad category that includes smart phones and laptops, and high-tech products, the report shows.",
      "China\u2019s exports of rare earths fell nearly 11% in the first quarter of the year as Beijing tightened controls on the strategically vital materials used in electric vehicles and other high-tech products.",
      "The customs data showed total exports from the world\u2019s second largest economy rose 5.8% in the first three months of the year from a year earlier while imports sank 7%, leaving a trade surplus of $273 billion.",
      "Late Friday, Trump exempted most computer-related goods from the higher China-specific tariffs, including laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them, though his administration says he plans to announce those within days. Such products accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year.",
      "Still, the harsh U.S. tariffs on Chinese products have raised questions about whether exporters might end up diverting their goods to other overseas markets as they give up on selling to American consumers due to the more than doubling of import duties.",
      "The biggest increases in exports in March were to China's Southeast Asian neighbors, which saw the dollar value of shipments from China jump 8% in March from a year earlier. Exports to Africa rose more than 11% and those to India by nearly 14%.",
      "A customs administration spokesperson, Lyu Daliang, said China was facing a \u201ccomplex and severe external situation\u201d but that the sky would not fall. He pointed to China\u2019s diversified export options and huge domestic market.",
      "When asked about falling Chinese imports, he told reporters in Beijing that China has been the world\u2019s second largest importer for 16 straight years, increasing its share of global imports from about 8% to 10.5%.",
      "\u201cAt present and in the future, China\u2019s import growth space is huge, and the large Chinese market is always a great opportunity for the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping was visiting Vietnam on Monday as part of a regional tour that also will take him to Malaysia and Cambodia, giving him an opportunity to firm up trade ties with other Asian countries that also are facing potentially steep tariffs, though last week Trump delayed enforcing them by 90 days.",
      "China's exports to Vietnam jumped nearly 17% last month from a year earlier, while its imports fell 2.7%.",

      "China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping says no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia with a trip to Vietnam",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China's leader Xi Jinping said no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia on Monday, reiterating China's commitment to global trade in contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariffs moves.",
      "Although Trump has paused some tariffs, he has kept in place 145% duties on China, the world's second-largest economy.",
      "\u201cThere are no winners in a trade war, or a tariff war,\u201d Xi wrote in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media. \u201cOur two countries should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.\u201d",
      "Xi's visit lets China show Southeast Asia it is a \u201cresponsible superpower in the way that contrasts with the way the U.S. under President Donald Trump presents to the whole world,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.",
      "Xi was greeted on the tarmac by Vietnam's President Luong Cuong at the start of his two-day visit, a mark of honor not often given to visitors, said Nguyen Thanh Trung, a professor of Vietnamese studies at Fulbright University Vietnam. Students of a drum art group performed as women waved the red and yellow Chinese and Communist Party flags.",
      "While Xi\u2019s trip likely was planned earlier, it has become significant because of the tariff fight between China and the U.S. The visit offers a path for Beijing to shore up its alliances and find solutions for the high trade barrier that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese exports.",
      "In Vietnam, Xi will meet with Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, his counterpart, as well as the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.",
      "\u201cThe trip to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia is all about how China can really insulate itself against the from Trump,\u201d said Nguyen Khac Giang, pointing out that since Xi became the president in 2013, he has only visited Vietnam twice.",
      "The timing of the visit sends a \u201cstrong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,\u201d said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. She said that given the severity of Trump's tariffs and despite the 90-day pause, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that the tariffs, if implemented, could complicate their development.",
      "Vietnam is experienced at balancing its relations with the U.S and China. It is run under a communist, one-party system like China but has had a strong relationship with the U.S.",
      "In 2023, it was the only country that received both U.S. President Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the U.S. to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of countries trying to decouple their supply chains from China, as businesses moved here. China is its biggest trading partner, and China-Vietnam trade surged 14.6% year-on-year in 2024, according to Chinese state media.",
      "But the intensification of the trade war has put Vietnam in a \u201cvery precarious situation\u201d given the impression in the U.S. that Vietnam is serving as a backdoor for Chinese goods, said Giang, the analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute. Vietnam had been hit with 46% tariffs under Trump's order before the 90-day pause.",
      "China and Vietnam have real long-term differences, including territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has faced off with China\u2019s coast guard but does not often publicize the confrontations.",

      "LONDON -- Chinese companies will have to clear a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d when investing in key sectors in the U.K., the country's business secretary said Sunday, a day after he took effective control of Britain\u2019s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese owners.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds said Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020, had not been negotiating \u201cin good faith\u201d with the government in recent months over the future of the heavily loss-making steel works in Scunthorpe in the north of England.",
      "Reynolds said it had become clear on Thursday that Jingye would not accept any financial offer from the government and that it was the company's intention to close the blast furnaces \u201ccome what may,\u201d while keeping the more profitable steel mill operations and supplying them from China.",
      "In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, he declined to accuse the company of deliberately sabotaging the business at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party, but did accept that there is now a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d to bringing Chinese investment into the U.K.",
      "\u201cI personally wouldn't bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think steel is a very sensitive area.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers back to Parliament on Saturday to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking Jingye from closing the two blast furnaces. The bill, which is now law, gives Reynolds the power to direct British Steel's board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running.",
      "The British government had been under pressure to act after Jingye\u2019s recent decision to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without them and other raw materials, such as coking coal, the furnaces would likely have to shut for good, potentially within days, as they are extremely difficult and expensive to restart once cooled.",
      "That would mean the U.K., which in the late 19th century was the world\u2019s steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material, which use greener electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces.",
      "The repercussions would be huge for industries like construction, defense and rail and make the country dependent on foreign sources for so-called virgin steel, a vulnerability that lawmakers from all political parties balked at.",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, Reynolds declined to give a full guarantee that British Steel will be able to secure enough raw materials in time to keep the blast furnaces going.",
      "He said he would not \u201cmake my situation or the nation\u2019s situation more difficult\u201d by commenting on specific commercial details.",
      "\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t acted, the blast furnaces were gone, steel production in the U.K., primary steel producing, would have gone,\" he said. \"So we\u2019ve given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that.\u201d",

      "Justin Rose has been down this road before",
      "HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. -- The farther Justin Rose drove from Augusta National only made him realize how close he came to winning the Masters.",
      "His phone kept buzzing on the way to Hilton Head Island, one text after another, all of them with the same message that applauded his remarkable rally and offered commiseration and condolences for his runner-up finish to Rory McIlroy.",
      "Rose started the final round seven shots out of the lead, too far back to think about winning. He made a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a 66. He was in a sudden-death playoff. He lost on a great shot by McIlroy, who hit gap wedge to 3 feet for birdie.",
      "It was a lot to process.",
      "\u201cA lot of outpouring from people with a lot of positive comments coming at me, so trying to absorb that, trying to absorb the week,\u201d Rose said Wednesday at the RBC Heritage. \u201cBut at the same time, looking at my phone and just wishing there was a different message there.\u201d",
      "This is a path he knows well.",
      "Rose had a two-shot lead with six holes to play in the 2017 Masters when Sergio Garcia \u2014 like McIlroy, a good friend \u2014 made a most improbable rally to force a playoff and beat Rose on the first extra hole.",
      "Rose was classy in defeat that day in 2017. He lovingly patted Garcia's cheek, they embraced, and then Rose tapped Garcia on the heart. He knew what it meant for a talented Spaniard who had played 70 majors before winning.",
      "He was equally gracious on Sunday, telling McIlroy when it was over he was happy to witness such a momentous occasion of the career Grand Slam.",
      "It still hurts.",
      "He searched for the right words. Rose was proud of how he played to match the low score of the final round with a 66. In one of those must-make moments in a major, he poured in a birdie on the last hole. There was a lot that went right. But there was no green jacket.",
      "\u201cJust sort of ... don't know what the right word is,\u201d he said. \u201cTormented, probably, by the thought of what might have been.\u201d",
      "He joined Ben Hogan as the only player to lose a playoff twice at the Masters, and it might have stung worse for Rose because both his losses were in sudden-death. He now has had at least a share of the lead after 12 rounds at the Masters, fourth on the list behind Jack Nicklaus (19), Arnold Palmer (18) and Gary Player (12), who have combined to win 13 green jackets.",
      "He has 23 wins worldwide, including a major at the U.S. Open and an Olympic gold medal in Rio de Janeiro. He also has the distinction of congratulating a Masters champion on the 18th green three times in the last 10 years \u2014 Jordan Spieth in 2015, Garcia in 2017, McIlroy on Sunday.",
      "The last time he lost the Masters in a playoff, Rose said it lingered for about a month. Sure, he made a few bogeys he'd like to have back from the final round Sunday. That's true for anyone at any golf tournament. There's still the sting of seeing someone else win.",
      "Rose would rather look back to what followed after that 2017 loss. He went on to win three more times that year, including his second World Golf Championships title. He won the FedEx Cup the following year and rose to No. 1 in the world for the first time.",
      "\u201cIf I look back to my best golf, 2017 August through to the end of '18 is probably the most consistently good golf that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Rose said. \u201cObviously, I was a little bit more in the prime of my career around that time, or you could argue more prime.\u201d",
      "Rose, who turned pro as a teenager in 1998, will be 45 at the end of July.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t see any reason why that can\u2019t be the same this time around,\" he said. \u201cI'm working well. I'm working hard. I'm feeling good about my game. I've been saying all year that my game is good. I've just got to make sure that I\u2019m playing consistently well enough to give myself those opportunities, because majors come around ... only four times a year.\u201d",
      "Rose can't help but think how little it would take for him to be going to the PGA Championship next month at Quail Hollow with a shot at the career Grand Slam himself \u2014 briefly tied for the Sunday lead at Royal Troon, a playoff loss at the Masters.",
      "\u201cThe last two majors I\u2019ve been right there and been beaten by the top players in the world at the peak of their game,\u201d he said.",
      "What keeps him going at this stage? He will have completed his 28th year as a pro in July.",
      "It's moments like Sunday, being in the thick of it, delivering clutch moments. There was the birdie putt on the 18th at Augusta. There was that 8-foot putt on the 18th hole at the Ryder Cup in 2023 that earned a key halve. There was that walk up the 18th at Royal Troon last summer with thousands on their feet showing appreciation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m close to kind of some seriously good stuff,\u201d Rose said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Robinson Can\u00f3 spent 17 seasons playing Major League Baseball in front of all kinds of baseball fans, but he feels there\u2019s something special about his recent stint with the Diablos Rojos of the Mexican Baseball League.",
      "He's not alone.",
      "Mexico\u2019s summer league will open it\u2019s 100th season on Thursday aiming to keep an impressive growth in attendance that began after the Mexican national team\u2019s surprise run at the 2023 World Baseball Classic and now is already surpassing some first-division soccer clubs.",
      "After finishing third in the 2023 tournament, many casual fans, some of them soccer enthusiasts disappointed after Mexico's national team was eliminated in the first round in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, turned their attention to baseball and many of them appear to have stayed for the long haul.",
      "\u201cWe are constantly striving for growth and this season is not going to be different,\u201d league president Horacio de la Vega told The Associated Press. \u201cOur growth has to do with the fact that we are not selling just baseball, but a whole experience.\u201d",
      "In Mexico City, the \u201cbaseball experience\u201d happens in the $160 million Alfredo Harp Helu Stadium, a venue that opened in March 2019 and seats 20,000.",
      "Even though the ballpark is small compared to MLB standards, the carnival-like atmosphere stands out.",
      "\u201cThis a special city, where the fans come to each game weather it is day or night,\u201d Can\u00f3 told the AP. \u201cAs a player, it is a big motivation to see the park full of fans supporting baseball.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old Dominican, who appeared in eight All-Star Games, played in the United States for five franchises, among them the New York Yankees. He was a key player to lead Diablos Rojos to the championship last season and he recently agreed to return for a second one.",
      "Thorough his career, Can\u00f3 has played for the Dominican Republic's Estrellas Orientales and participated in several Caribbean Series, a team tournament played each year in different countries around Mexico and Central America.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere in Mexico is somewhat like the Caribbean Series, but in there you are playing for your country and it is short tournament,\u201d Cano said. \u201cHere, it's a long season and yet the fans are still there every night.\u201d",
      "Las season, the Diablos Rojos topped the average attendance in the league with 11,694, followed by Toros de Tijuana (11,354) and Sultanes de Monterrey (9,092).",
      "Soccer clubs Pachuca (10,713), Santos Torreon (9,421), Mazatlan (9,522) and Ciudad Juarez (8,980) have worse attendance despite playing in bigger stadiums. The team with the best attendance in the Mexican soccer league is Monterrey with 43,544.",
      "\u201cWe have a great group of owners even though they are rivals on the field. Off it they work as allies and share all kinds of things, from how to clean bathrooms, how to have better food courts and even to sell beer,\u201d De la Vega said.",
      "Mexico City has three soccer stadiums: Ciudad de los Deportes, Olimpico Universitario and Azteca, but none of them has great facilities. There are no elevators, escalators or even food courts. Azteca is currently closed for renovations and might have them for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The same thing happens in most of the other Liga MX stadiums. The most fan friendly venues are Estadio BBVA in Monterrey and the Akron in Guadalajara. Both were chosen to host games in the next World Cup.",
      "\u201cWe have been growing steadily and this being a special season we are aiming at a record 5 million fans in total attendance,\u201d De la Vega said.",
      "After the World Baseball Classic in 2023, 4.734 million fans set the league attendance record for a season. Last year, the number dipped, but only by 93,000 fans.",
      "And the fans are getting younger, too. According to Othon Diaz, the Diablos Rojos president, nine years ago 53% of the team\u2019s fans were 55 years or older and now 74% of them are under 45. Also, they averaged 3,000 fans per game and now it\u2019s up to 11,000.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- As he discusses his excitement about finally being healthy for the start of a postseason run, Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo compares himself to a certain action movie star.",
      "\u201cI love playing in, how can I say, pressure, stressful situations,\u201d Antetokounmpo said this week as the Bucks prepare to open the playoffs Saturday at Indiana. \u201cI\u2019m like Tom Cruise. Have you ever seen the movies, the Tom Cruise movies that he does all the stunts? I think he gets an adrenaline rush. I love being there again.\u201d",
      "After missing all of Milwaukee\u2019s postseason run last year and part of it the year before \u2014 with his absence leading to consecutive first-round exits \u2014 Antetokounmpo is back to lead the Bucks as he pursues his second career title.",
      "If it\u2019s not quite a mission impossible, it certainly seems improbable.",
      "The Bucks are expected to open the playoffs without seven-time all-NBA guard Damian Lillard, who has been out for the last month with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf. The Bucks are seeded fifth in the Eastern Conference, their lowest playoff position since 2018. BetMGM Sportsbook gives the Bucks only a 37% chance of even getting past their first-round series with the fourth-seeded Pacers.",
      "Yet the Bucks believe they can compete with anyone as long as Antetokounmpo is available. They remember how much the two-time MVP's absence was felt last year in their 4-2 series loss to Indiana.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cTake the best player off of every team and it hurts them. Take one of the best players of our generation off your team, it\u2019s going to crush you. It\u2019s just nice having him on the floor.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo, 30, missed last year\u2019s Indiana series after straining his left calf in the 79th game of the regular season. A year earlier, he bruised his lower back in the first quarter of Milwaukee\u2019s opening playoff game against Miami and didn\u2019t return to action until Game 4 of a series the top-seeded Bucks eventually lost 4-1.",
      "At the end of last season, Antetokounmpo said he\u2019d have to ponder changing his offseason program or make other adaptations to assure he\u2019d stay healthy for the playoffs. He now enters the playoffs in peak form after leading Milwaukee to an eight-game winning streak to close the regular season.",
      "\u201cI made a lot of adjustments \u2014 that I\u2019ll keep private \u2014 but luck definitely plays a role, too,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou can be unlucky. Going down three games, or six games, I don\u2019t even remember, before the playoffs last year, that\u2019s being unlucky. But yeah, I think we made a lot of adjustments, me and my team, and I\u2019m here today, so I\u2019m happy.\u201d",
      "The last time Antetokounmpo played in an entire playoff series, he had 33.9 points, 14.7 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in the Bucks\u2019 4-3 Eastern Conference semifinal loss to Boston in 2022. He became the first player in NBA history to collect 200 points, 100 rebounds and 50 assists in a single playoff series.",
      "A year before that, Antetokounmpo missed the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee but came back to earn NBA Finals MVP honors and score 50 points in a title-clinching Game 6 victory over the Phoenix Suns.",
      "Now he\u2019s back and leading a new-look Bucks roster.",
      "Antetokounmpo, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis and Pat Connaughton are the only players remaining from Milwaukee\u2019s 2021 championship team. Kyle Kuzma, acquired at the trade deadline, was on the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 2020 championship team but last made the playoffs in 2021. Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins, whose roles expanded due to Lilllard's health issues, have never played in a postseason game.",
      "Lillard's absence has resulted in more ball-handling responsibilities for Antetokounmpo, who has been playing particularly well even by his lofty standards.",
      "The 6-11 forward ended the regular season ranked second in scoring (30.4), sixth in rebounding (11.9) and 13th in assists (6.5). Antetokounmpo is the only player ever to average 30 points while shooting at least 60% from the floor, and he\u2019s done that each of the last two seasons.",
      "In the six games he\u2019s played this month, Antetokounmpo has averaged 31.8 points, 12 rebounds and 11.8 assists while recording four triple-doubles.",
      "\u201cDuring this period where Dame has been out, he\u2019s been seeing consistent double teams, so he\u2019s just continued to evolve as a great player,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cHe\u2019s mixing in the assist, the laser passes, the skip passes cross-court which are very difficult to deal with when you\u2019re double-teaming him, and his shooting has gotten better and better.\u201d",
      "Now he gets a chance to try carrying that over to the postseason, a stage he missed dearly last year.",
      "\u201cWatching the game on the bench is not fun,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun. Maybe in 20 years, I can put on a polo or a suit \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the coaches wear \u2014 and watch it from the bench. But now I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m out there and I\u2019m in the heat of the battle and I\u2019m able to get my hands dirty and help my team win.\u201d",

      "That number was up from 54 in 2023, 44 in 2022, 16 in 2021 and 19 in 2020.",
      "There have been more older prospects drafted in recent years because the COVID-19 pandemic gave players an option to stay in school an extra year. Even though the window is ending, the transfer portal and NIL deals might continue to keep some players in school longer.",
      "Teams used to shy away from older prospects. Scouts and general managers once considered the age of 24 a red flag in some cases.",
      "But the success of guys like Nix and Jayden Daniels, who turned 24 during an outstanding rookie season, shows that experience can help players make an immediate impact in the pros.",
      "\u201cI came from BYU, where kids go on missions for a couple years, and so people go: \u2018Well, they\u2019re too old,'\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cWell, then they come in and they do a pretty good job. So, and really, if you start taking averages of careers, career length, there\u2019s maybe a cutoff somewhere, but the careers aren\u2019t very long as it is. But we do look at (age), though.\"",
      "A majority of the older players selected in the draft last year were Day 3 picks, going in the sixth or seventh round. That indicates teams are more likely to overlook age later in the draft.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just unique to where we\u2019re at right now in kind of the football world,\u201d Raiders general manager John Spytek said. \u201cYou got guys with sixth and seventh years really, and so you\u2019ve got to talk about a value of are we going to have a problem with the 25- or 26-year-old? Some people have more problems with that. I\u2019m just looking for good football players, and I\u2019m trying to impress that upon our scouts, too. Let\u2019s just find good football players. We\u2019ll figure it out. So I will say it\u2019s been really hard on the area scouts.",
      "\u201cYou go into these schools like Georgia and Michigan, Ohio State, and they\u2019ve got a list of 30 guys that can potentially come out. ... I mean it used to just be like here\u2019s these 10 juniors, maybe half of them come out. Now it\u2019s like, you got a fourth-year, fifth-year senior, and he might take another year. So it adds a lot more names to it and uncertainty and a lot more work that has to get done in a finite amount of time. And that\u2019s why the scouts\u2019 jobs are so critical to go through all that in an efficient way and present the players the right way. We\u2019re relying on it. It\u2019s critical to every organization.\u201d",
      "The number of older players drafted will decrease this season. There are 46 players age 23 or older who are draft eligible, including 17 who are 24 or older.",
      "Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough, who turns 26 in September, was the oldest player at the scouting combine. He spent seven years at three colleges, including Oregon, where he backed up Justin Herbert in 2019, and Texas Tech.",
      "Tennessee wide receiver Bru McCoy, San Jose State wideout Nick Nash and Arkansas receiver Andrew Armstrong were among the 24-year-old draft prospects at the combine.",
      "Teams that stick to the old philosophy of avoiding older players limit their talent pool.",
      "\u201cI think sometimes you have to ask yourself, are you trying to get this guy for 12 years? If you\u2019re looking for that, it\u2019s a small percentage,\u201d 49ers general manager John Lynch said. \u201cOr are you looking for one contract and then hopefully more? It\u2019s an interesting topic. It\u2019s one we constantly discuss. There are pluses and minuses to both sides. Having a young guy that you think you can develop and is already a good player, and then a guy who\u2019s a little more battle-tested ... bent through a little more. It\u2019s an interesting conversation.\u201d",
      "College experience is most valuable for quarterbacks. Nix and Daniels proved it last year when they led their teams to the playoffs. Meanwhile, Anthony Richardson threw just 393 passes in college before the Colts drafted him No. 4 overall in 2023. He has struggled to adjust at the NFL level.",
      "The oldest player ever selected in the draft was quarterback Chris Weinke. He was 28 years and 264 days old when the Panthers selected him in the fourth round of the 2000 draft. Weinke started just 20 games in the NFL, going 2-18.",
      "Quarterback Brandon Weeden was the oldest player ever drafted in the first round. He was 28 years and 195 days old when the Browns chose him 22nd overall in 2012. Weeden made 25 starts, going 6-19. Both Weinke and Weeden played minor-league baseball before college football.",
      "Depending on the position of a player and the round, age can be a determining factor when a team is choosing between two guys.",
      "\u201cWhen two players are level, even, same grade, you start weighing what they have,\u201d Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz said about age. \u201cOK, he\u2019s a three-year starter and he\u2019s a four-year starter. Great leader, team captain, those little things give them a bump. It\u2019s not intentional but you talk through it and it shakes out that way.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m sad it\u2019s over, obviously. That\u2019s pretty much the only answer I can give you right now,\u201d forward David Pastrnak said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. Obviously want to keep playing. And I\u2019ll leave it at that, I guess.\u201d",
      "The Bruins had topped 100 points in each of the six previous non-pandemic years, including a record-setting 135-point 2022-23 campaign that was the best regular season in NHL history. But since losing in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final, they haven\u2019t made it past the second round of the playoffs; they have won only one series in the last four years.",
      "That led to the firing of first Bruce Cassidy, and then Jim Montgomery, who was let go 20 games into this season and replaced with Joe Sacco. But the interim coach could only manage a 25-30-7 record the rest of the way \u2014 last in the Atlantic Division, and no better than tied for last in the whole Eastern Conference.",
      "Sacco, who is not expected to return, was hobbled by a trade deadline surrender that purged captain Brad Marchand and a handful of other players from the roster. He said he hadn\u2019t had a chance to look back on a season that changed dramatically just six weeks in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty busy since the change,\u201d said the 56-year-old suburban Boston native, who played at Boston University before a 13-year NHL career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s special to be able to coach obviously in your hometown. That\u2019s obviously an added bonus,\u201d Sacco said. \u201cI\u2019ll think more about it as the days go on. But I\u2019m proud of the guys. I know there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts this year and they haven\u2019t quit \u2014 right to the end.\u201d",
      "Pastrnak led the team with 43 goals and 63 assists, and his 106 points were nearly twice as many as his nearest teammate. With Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm injured, there wasn\u2019t much help on defense.",
      "And Jeremy Swayman struggled after signing an eight-year, $66 million contract and ending his holdout two days before the season opener.",
      "\u201cThe major takeaway is just finding a way to win. And no matter how we do it, we have to compete every single day,\u201d Swayman said. \u201cWe\u2019re a proud program. And we owe it to ourselves \u2014 really to our fans \u2014 to be a lot better. And I\u2019m excited for for the comeback.\u201d",

      "Attorneys working on the legal settlement designed to reshape college sports filed a brief that did not offer changes a judge suggested regarding roster limits, reiterating the benefit the limits provide to some athletes and the havoc a late change to ...",
      "Attorneys working on the $2.8 billion legal settlement designed to reshape college sports filed a brief Monday night that did not include changes a judge suggested regarding team roster limits, saying such a late change to that rule would create havoc.",
      "The plan on the table, the attorneys said, \u201cis a vast improvement over the status quo\u201d and the offered only a few tweaks to the sprawling deal announced last year that will clear the way for schools to begin sharing millions in revenue with their athletes and pay hundreds of millions more to former and current athletes who said they were illegally prevented from earning money.",
      "The filing came in response to U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken's suggestion last week that the terms of the roster limit rules be adjusted \u201cto grandfather in a group of rostered people\u201d set to lose their spots on teams if the caps come into play.",
      "The defendants \u2014 the NCAA and the nation's five largest conferences \u2014 said such a move would \u201ccause significant disruption.\u201d They said countless roster moves have already been made in anticipation of the settlement going into effect on July 1.",
      "\u201cThese decisions, in turn, cascaded into tens of thousands of decisions by individual student-athletes,\u201d the attorneys said. \u201cMany kept their pre-existing roster spots (and may now receive scholarships), because the roster limits were designed to capture the average number of participants across a season and thereby minimize disruptions from the transition. Some transferred to new schools to seek roster spots and enhanced opportunities for athletic competition. ... while implementing a \u2018grandfather\u2019 provision might benefit some athletes, it would, at the same time, upset the settled expectations, enrollment decisions and other preparations of numerous other student-athletes and member institutions.\u201d",
      "Wilken has already granted preliminary approval of the settlement. In addition to asking for Monday's adjustments from attorneys on both sides of the case, Wilken has asked for objectors to respond to the new brief on Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys expect her final decision on the settlement to come in a matter of weeks, with the July 1 deadline bearing down.",
      "In what was supposed to be the final hearing a week ago, more than a dozen athletes and their lawyers outlines their objections to to the terms.",
      "Of all the arguments over the deal, which sets a template for schools to pay athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness and outlines $2.78 billion in back pay to athletes who played before NIL, those about roster limits appeared to make the biggest impact on Wilken.",
      "Under current rules, schools must adhere to a scholarship limit in each sport, but there are no roster limits. There are spots for walk-ons and partial scholarship recipients, all of whom can later qualify for aid.",
      "The new rules propose roster limits and make everyone eligible for scholarships. It could increase the total amount of aid available but is expected to cost athletes thousands of roster spots across the country as schools look to cut expenses to absorb higher costs.",
      "One example: Some women's swim teams currently divide 14 scholarships among 40 or more athletes. Under the new rules, most rosters would be capped at 30, but all those players could receive full rides.",
      "Wilken said figuring out a way to delay implementation wouldn't be that expensive and \u201cwould save a lot of good will and angst and unhappiness from a lot of students and their parents, so why not just do it?\u201d",
      "In their filing, attorneys said it would be too \u201cunworkable,\u201d with athletes perhaps seeking to start over after making a change: \u201cAnd every additional \u2018round\u2019 of re-dos permitted would create a new set of potentially affected student-athletes who might want re-dos themselves; with thousands if not more individual decisions having been made on the understanding the roster limits would likely go in effect in less than three months.\u201d",
      "The brief also argued that one of the most overlooked parts of the roster limits is how much more aid would go to athletes.",
      "\u201cIndeed, while it is unfortunate that a small number of athletes may ultimately have lost roster spots as a result of the settlement, the settlement afforded them an opportunity to compete for scholarships (or larger scholarships) and additional compensation and benefits that were not previously available,\u201d they attorneys wrote.",
      "The brief sought to address other concerns of the judge:",
      "\u2014 By agreeing to clarify that future Division I athletes -- they are covered under the 10-year term of the settlement even if they are not yet in college -- will have a chance to object to the deal and not release any claims until they have a chance to be heard or until their 60-day objection window ends. The defendants are hoping to avoid an endless series of court challenges over the same issues of athlete compensation.",
      "\u201cCollege sports would be entirely unmanageable if individual future college athletes (or groups of future athletes) pursued different types of injunctive relief year over year over year,\u201d the filing said. The settlement \u201cworks only if it is durable and applicable to all current and future class members.\u201d",
      "\u2014 By addressing what some objectors said were glitches in the system athletes use to calculate damages claims and asking the judge to OK a claims extension to May 16. A week ago, LSU gymnast and influencer Olivia Dunne told Wilken that the settlement hardly acknowledges her true value and potential earning power; the Monday filing said she would be among those receiving an updated allocation.",

      "The Trump administration plans to rewrite part of the Endangered Species Act that prohibits harming the habitats of endangered and threatened species",
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species in a move environmentalists say would lead to the extinction of critically endangered species due to logging, mining, development and other activities.",
      "At issue is a longstanding definition of \u201charm\u201d in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live. Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The proposed rule \u201ccuts the heart out of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Greenwald. \u201cIf (you) say harm doesn\u2019t mean significant habitat degradation or modification, then it really leaves endangered species out in the cold.\u201d",
      "For example, he said spotted owls and Florida panthers both are protected because the current rule forbids habitat destruction. But if the new rule is adopted, someone who logs in a forest or builds a development would be unimpeded as long as they could say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, he said.",
      "The proposed rule was expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, kicking off a 30-day public comment period.",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to the Department of Interior, which declined to comment.",
      "Environmental groups will challenge the rule in court if it is adopted, said Drew Caputo, an attorney at Earthjustice.",
      "He said the proposal \u201cthreatens a half-century of progress in protecting and restoring endangered species,\u201d including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales. He said that's because the current rule \u201crecognizes the common-sense concept that destroying a forest, beach, river, or wetland that a species relies on for survival constitutes harm to that species.\u201d",
      "The question is whether the Trump administration is entitled to repeal a rule that was upheld specifically by the Supreme Court and therefore subject to precedent, said Patrick Parenteau, an emeritus professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School who has handled endangered species cases.",
      "Because of the current definition of harm, \u201cmany, many millions of acres of land has been conserved\u201d to help keep species alive, he said.",
      "The issue is of particular concern in Hawaii, which has more endangered species than any other state \u2014 40% of the nation\u2019s federally listed threatened and endangered species \u2014 even though it has less than 1% of the land area, according to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.",
      "Birds are among the most vulnerable. Since humans arrived, 71 birds have gone extinct, according to the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. Thirty-one of the 42 remaining endemic birds are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the department said and ten of these haven\u2019t been seen in decades.",

      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is emphasizing that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he liked the companies \u2014 not to cut competition as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial",
      "WASHINGTON -- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies \u2014 not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.",
      "Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon. He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.",
      "Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.",
      "Zuckerberg said he\u2019s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company\u2019s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.",
      "\u201cThis is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly\u201d to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.",
      "Hansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.",
      "Zuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.",
      "While Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor \u2014 because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook \u2014 Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.",
      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.",
      "Under questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.\u201d",
      "Hansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.",
      "He said his interest in buying it was \u201cthe usage of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought the app was important and valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg said.",
      "The trial, which is slated to last weeks, will feature other Big-Tech figures. After Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, took the stand.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s FTC\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta\u2019s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

    "story": [
      "The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges and universities across the country",
      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",
      "In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",
      "\u201cThese are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren\u2019t hiding. They\u2019re in school.\u201d",
      "Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.",
      "A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university\u2019s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.",

They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal.",
      "In a separate criminal case, Kenyan Dennis Ng\u2019ang\u2019a and Vietnamese Duh Hung Nguyen also were charged with illegal trafficking in the same courtroom, following their arrest while in possession of 400 ants.",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service said the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia, and that the species included messor cephalotes, a distinctive, large and red-colored harvester ant native to East Africa.",
      "The illegal export of the ants \"not only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent \"a shift in trafficking trends \u2014 from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,\u201d KWS said.",
      "The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya\u2019s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months.",
      "The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments.",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses",
      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Justice Department has released two documents that were used to allegedly tie wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang.",
    "story": [
      "A judge on Tuesday ordered administration officials to testify in the case.",
      "The Department of Justice filed notice Wednesday that it will appeal the order from a federal judge requiring the government to facilitate the return of wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, on the same day the it released two documents that were previously used to allegedly tie him to the criminal gang MS-13.",
      "The two forms the government present as evidence -- a gang field interview sheet from the Prince George's County Police Department in Maryland and an additional form from the Department of Homeland Security -- base Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation on his clothing and information from a confidential informant described as a \"past proven and reliable source of information.\"",
      "The reports provide no other information beyond the clothing and confidential informant to justify the claim that Abrego Garcia is a ranking gang member.",
      "Abrego Garcia is entering his second month in an El Salvador mega-prison after he was deported there on March 15 despite being issued a 2019 court order barring his deportation to his home country due to the fear of persecution.",
      "His attorneys and his wife have denied he is a member of MS-13, and his lawyers have called into question the validity of the document by alleging the detective who authored it was later suspended.",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News' Jay O'Brien on Tuesday that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was the result of a \"clerical error\" and that \"he should have been sent to a detention center in Mexico, Nicaragua, Egypt.\"",
      "According to the gang field interview sheet \u2013 a report of the police\u2019s interaction with Abrego Garcia \u2013 he was approached by police in 2019 after they said he was loitering in a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville, Maryland.",
      "The report noted that Abrego Garcia wore a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie emblazoned with images of rolls of money covering the eyes and ears of former U.S. presidents, which police claimed tied Abrego Garcia to the gang.",
      "\"Officers know such clothing to be indicative of the Hispanic gang culture,\" the report said, noting that the meaning of the clothing is \"see no evil, hear no evil and say no evil.\"",
      "\"Wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents that they are a member in good standing with the MS-13,\" the report said.",
      "According to the report, officers contacted a \"past proven and reliable source of information\" who said that Abrego Garcia was a ranking member of MS-13. Abrego Garcia had the rank of \"Chequeo\" and had the moniker \"Chele,\" according to the informant. According to the DOJ, a chequeo is a low level member of MS-13.",
      "The DHS report added that Abrego Garcia was in possession of $1,178 at the time of his arrest.",
      "The report noted that Abrego Garcia was in the company of three other men when he was arrested, one of whom, according to police, had an extensive criminal history and was known as an active gang member. Another was linked to MS-13 based on a confidential source, the report said.",
      "Police said they were unable to link the third man to the gang, writing that \"MS-13 gang members are only allowed to hang around other members or prospects for the gang.\"",
      "The other document -- a DHS I-213 form -- cited the Prince George's County Police Department field interview sheet to claim that Abrego Garcia was \"identified\" and \"validated\" as a member of MS-13. Abrego Garcia denied having any information about the gang or human smuggling, according to the DHS report.",
      "An immigration judge who denied Abrego Garcia bond in 2019 cited both reports as the main evidence to conclude he posed a risk to the community.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have highlighted apparent inconsistencies in the DHS report, saying it offers contradictory assessments regarding whether Abrego Garcia feared being removed to El Salvador.",
      "His attorneys have also highlighted that the confidential information linked Abrego Garcia to the Western clique of MS-13, which principally operates on Long Island, where they say he has never lived.",
      "The report also noted that the two other alleged gang members at the Home Depot parking lot were members of a different MS-13 clique.",
      "Wednesday's developments came a day after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered government officials to testify under oath because, she said, they had \"done nothing to aid in Abrego Garcia's release from custody and return to the United States,\" despite the Supreme Court directing the Trump administration to \"'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.\"",
      "Per Judge Xinis' orders, the Trump administration on Wednesday submitted its daily status update on Abrego Garcia, saying that were \"no further updates.\"",
      "\"Given the government's prior clear and unequivocal notice to the Court regarding how the government will facilitate Abrego Garcia's return within the contours of existing law and regulation, there are no further updates,\" Joseph Mazzarra, the Acting General Counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, said in the update.",

      "Tariffs set off one of the most volatile trading periods in Wall Street history.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs set off one of the most volatile periods of stock trading in U.S. history \u2013 and uncertainty still looms over Wall Street, analysts told ABC News.",
      "Tariffs remain the primary mover of stock prices, putting market strategists and everyday investors in the near-impossible position of anticipating Trump\u2019s next decision and its potential fallout, the analysts said.",
      "Analysts warned of a possible economic downturn that would pummel stocks but urged investors to hold on to shares if they can resist the temptation to sell, since markets typically rise over the long term.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s policy swerves \u201cleave the markets kind of baffled, without investors having a clear idea of whether they should hold or fold when it comes to their own stock portfolio,\u201d Ed Yardeni, the president of market advisory firm Yardeni Research and former chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank's U.S. equities division, told ABC News.",
      "Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, told investors this week: \u201cTrying to predict policy \u2013 or markets\u2019 next move \u2013 is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "After Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in the Rose Garden on April 2, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses since the pandemic. When Trump paused some of the tariffs a week later, the indexes soared, recovering much of their losses. Since then, however, an escalating trade war with tariffs has contributed to topsy-turvy markets.",
      "Each of the major indexes stands lower than it did before Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped about 4%, while the S&P 500 has fallen roughly 5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has also declined roughly 5%.",
      "As markets swung, bond yields climbed and the U.S. dollar depreciated, prompting concerns about assets that typically serve as safe-haven investments during moments of instability for stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps set interest rates for mortgages and credit cards, has eased in recent days but stands well above its level at the outset of this month.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a wild time,\u201d Mike Loukas, CEO of TrueMark Investments, told ABC News.",
      "The volatility poses a challenge for market strategists, since the swings in day-to-day stock prices can be traced in large part to White House policies and announcements, rather than to economic data or corporate profits, analysts said.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he expects the tariffs to hike inflation and slow economic growth. Within minutes, stocks plummeted.",
      "During his remarks, Powell also said that recent stock volatility reflected the significance of the policy changes from the White House, rather than abnormal behavior in the markets.",
      "\"Markets are struggling with a lot of uncertainty and that means volatility,\" Powell told the audience at the Economic Club of Chicago. \"They're functioning just about as you'd expect them to function.\"",
      "Despite the market turmoil, the economy remains in solid shape by several key measures.",
      "The unemployment rate stands at a historically low level and hiring exceeded expectations last month. Additionally, inflation cooled in March, putting price increases well below a peak attained in 2022, fresh data last week showed.",
      "Still, that positive economic data covers a period before the April 2 tariffs announcement. A top measure of consumer sentiment this month dropped to a level lower than at any point during the Great Recession, according to a survey conducted by the University of Michigan. Numerous Wall Street firms and prominent investors also have raised their odds of the U.S. experiencing a recession within the next year.",
      "The latest developments in tariff policy will continue to move markets, analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration last week paused so-called \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on most countries for 90 days, vowing to pursue trade agreements with about 75 countries over that period. A high-stakes standoff between the U.S. and China \u2013 the world\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 holds implications for many large U.S. firms.",
      "San Diego-based financial firm LPL Financial said Tuesday that it had suspended its estimate of a year-end target level for the S&P 500.",
      "\u201cWith little visibility into where tariff rates shake out and the effects on earnings, it\u2019s hard to have much conviction,\u201d LPL Financial said in a memo to investors.",
      "While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, analysts who spoke to ABC News advised investors to remain in stocks if they view the holdings as long-term investments.",
      "Loukas, of TrueMark Investments, said he views Trump's tariffs policy as an effort to negotiate trade agreements, saying recent volatility is likely \"a short-term gyration for the market.\"",
      "However, he added: \"Take it with a grain of salt. If we\u2019re wrong, there could be impact for the underlying economic picture.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re basically taking a bet on the U.S. economy and on American companies,\u201d Yardeni said.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned in 45 years of this business: It\u2019s amazing how the economy and stock market do over time, despite Washington,\" Yardeni added.",

    "summary": "Kennedy has prioritized autism as one of the chronic illnesses he\u2019s determined to tackle in his aim to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy has prioritized autism in his aim to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\"",
      "On the heels of a new report showing that rates of autism diagnoses have again increased, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was determined to find the \"environmental exposures\" behind the rise and directed the National Institute of Health to launch new studies into \"everything\" -- from mold to obesity -- that could potentially be a factor.",
      "Kennedy, who prioritizes autism as one of the chronic illnesses he's determined to tackle in his aim to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" ardently pushed back against the explanation that a broadening definition of autism spectrum disorder is a meaningful contributor to more autism diagnoses.",
      "Kennedy said he wanted to \"move away\" from the idea that \"the autism prevalence increases -- the relentless increases -- are simply artifacts of better diagnoses, better recognition or changing diagnostic criteria.\"",
      "\"This epidemic denial has become a feature in the mainstream media, and it's based on an industry canard. And obviously there are people who don't want us to look at environmental exposures,\" Kennedy said, speaking at a press conference at the department headquarters on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.",
      "The report Kennedy mentioned \u2014 published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 estimated that autism prevalence has increased to 1 in 31 children, which Kennedy called \"shocking.\"",
      "In 2020, the same report found a prevalence of 1 in 36, and over two decades ago in 2000, the rate was 1 in 150.",
      "Experts in the field agree that the rates of diagnoses are increasing and that environmental factors could be at play \u2014 but also say most of the increase can be attributed to the expanding definition of autism, which broadened dramatically in recent decades to include subtler features of the illness, including new descriptors as recently as 2013.",
      "\"It's a fair question\" to ask why autism prevalence has increased, Dr. Catherine Lord, a psychologist and autism researcher at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, told ABC News, but she said that it's also important to acknowledge how much has changed.",
      "\"There's been a huge shift in terms of awareness of autism, particularly awareness of autism without severe intellectual disability, that really changed even since I entered this field,\" said Lord.",
      "Studies also suggest that autism risk is heavily rooted in genetics, by as much as 80%.",
      "Dr. Walter Zahorodny, a clinical psychologist and professor who studies autism at Rutgers University, joined Kennedy at Tuesday's press conference to emphasize that there has been a \"true increase\" in cases, something he said he has seen throughout his career in New Jersey \u2014 though he acknowledged, unlike Kennedy, a wider variety of possibilities, from environmental exposures to other \"risk factors.\"",
      "\"It is a true increase. There is better awareness of autism, but better awareness of autism cannot be driving disability like autism to increase by 300% in 20 years,\" Zahorodny said, referring to studies from New Jersey and the CDC report.",
      "Zahorodny said finding the cause was crucial and lamented a lack of progress to \"address this question seriously\" over his career.",
      "\"I would urge everyone to consider the likelihood that autism, whether we call it an epidemic, tsunami or a surge of autism, is a real thing that we don't understand, and it must be triggered or caused by environmental or risk factors,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy on Tuesday acknowledged that the increase in autism diagnoses could be in part caused by increased awareness, but said that still left a large portion of the jump in diagnoses unaccounted for.",
      "He called it \"indefensible\" to accept awareness as the main reason, describing high stakes of ruined families and \"individual tragedy.\"",
      "\"Autism destroys families, and more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children. These are children who should not be suffering like this,\" Kennedy said. \"These are kids who will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\"",
      "\"We have to recognize we are doing this to our children, and we need to put an end to it,\" he added.",
      "Not every case is as severe as Kennedy described, however; many people diagnosed with autism live highly functional adult lives. The recent CDC report found fewer than 40% of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder were classified as having an intellectual disability, meaning an IQ of less than 70.",
      "Dr. Barry Prizant, an adjunct professor in the department of communicative disorders at the University of Rhode Island and director of the private practice Childhood Communication Services, told ABC News that Kennedy's comments misrepresent what autism is like for families.",
      "\"I am not dismissing the challenges. There are considerable challenges, and a lot of those are barriers to services,\" he said. \"We've been doing a parent retreat weekend for 27 years, where we spend a weekend with 60 parents and family members, and we're not meeting with family members and parents who say, 'Autism is just a tragedy and it's hell in our lives.' They talk about the positives and the negatives, the joys as well as the challenges.\"",
      "Autism Speaks also released a statement on Wednesday, calling Kennedy comments \"extremely disappointing and damaging.\"",
      "\"Autism is not a preventable condition,\" the nonprofit autism organization said. \"The suggestion that it is\u2014especially when linked to environmental toxins without scientific evidence\u2014contributes to decades-old misinformation and distracts from the real needs of autistic people and their families.\"",
      "Kennedy said the NIH, led by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a former professor at Stanford University, will soon announce a series of new studies aimed at identifying precisely which environmental toxins are to blame. Kennedy cited mold, food, pesticides, medicines, ultrasounds, and the age and health of parents as possible culprits.",
      "Kennedy qualified that the study would provide \"some of the answers\" by September, which is a variation \u2014 welcomed by experts \u2014 from his claim to President Donald Trump last week that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "However, he also claimed on Tuesday: \"We know it's an environmental exposure.\"",
      "Asked by ABC News if he would commit to following the science revealed by the studies, regardless of his current expectations on what's causing the rise in diagnosis, the secretary said yes.",
      "\"We're going to follow the science no matter what it says,\" he said.",
      "Medical experts have been studying the potential causes of autism for decades. Research to date suggests that autism is driven by genetics, and the risk may increase when paired with certain outside factors, such as having children at an older age or exposure to pollutants.",
      "\"It's not simple,\" Lord said. \"If you look at high-quality publications, the findings are small and, in terms of causes other than the genetics, have been quite hard to replicate. Not meaning they're wrong, but just that we haven't quite figured out what they should be.\"",
      "HHS or NIH have not provided details about how the new studies will be conducted within the given timeframe, but Kennedy pledged transparency, saying the studies would be conducted in the traditional way of funding to academic institutions through the NIH.",

      "Letter to Justice Department claims James \"appears to have falsified\" records.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency has referred information about New York Attorney General Letitia James to the Justice Department regarding a loan on James' Virginia property, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.",
      "William Pulte, the director of the FHFA, alleges in his letter to the Justice Department, dated April 14, that James listed her Norfolk, Virginia property as her \"principal residence\" in August of 2023, \"despite being a statewide public office holder in the state of New York at that same time and primarily residing in the state of New York.\"",
      "The FHFA alleges in the letter that a July 2024 building permit \"lists her New York property as the 'JAMES RESIDENCE' and states 'Remain Occupied'.\"",
      "\"At the time of the 2023 Norfolk, VA property purchase and mortgage, Ms. James was the siting [sic] Attorney General of New York and is required by law to have her primary residence in the state of New York \u2013 even though her mortgage applications list her intent to have the Norfolk, VA property as her primary home,\" according to the letter. \"It appears Ms. James\u2019 property and mortgage-related misrepresentations may have continued to her recent 2023 Norfolk, VA property purchase in order to secure a lower interest rate and more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte, whom Trump appointed in March to lead the FHFA, further alleges in the letter that James \"appears to have falsified records in order to meet certain lending requirements and receive favorable loan terms,\" which he says \"could be violations of the criminal code,\" including wire, mail and bank fraud \"and/or other relevant state and federal laws.\"",
      "The letter concludes by stating that the FHFA \"look[s] forward to cooperating with the Department of Justice to support any actions that the Department of Justice finds appropriate.\"",
      "\u201cAttorney General James is focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this Administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the Constitution,\" a spokesperson for James' office said in a statement provided in response to an ABC News request for comment. \"She will not be intimidated by bullies \u2013 no matter who they are.\u201d",
      "James' office filed a business fraud suit against Trump and his organization in 2022, which resulted in a February 2024 ruling against Trump and fines in excess of $350 million. Former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to lying under oath in the civil trial and served five months in prison.",

      "The Justice Department has filed suit against Maine in an effort to challenge the state's policy regarding transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Maine's policy violates Title IX and stems from a broader effort by the Trump administration to spotlight an issue that they see as politically damaging for Democrats.",
      "\"The State of Maine, through its Department of Education, is openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" the lawsuit said. \"By prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine's policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and psychological harm.\"",
      "Bondi announced the lawsuit alongside anti-trans activist Riley Gaines and other parents and students from Maine who have objected to the state's policies regarding transgender athletes.",
      "\"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports. This is about sports. This is also about these young women's personal safety,\" Bondi said in remarks at DOJ. \"I met many of these women throughout the past weeks and months, and what they have been through is horrific.\"",
      "The lawsuit is likely just the first in a series of legal challenges brought by the Trump administration, after Bondi previously sent warning letters in February to state officials in Maine, California and Minnesota ordering them to \"comply with federal anti-discrimination laws that require them to keep men out of women's sports.\"",
      "Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has blasted the Trump administration's efforts to strip federal funding from Maine as executive overreach.",
      "\"For decades -- first as a District Attorney, as Attorney General, and now as Governor -- I have fought tirelessly for the rights of women and girls, for the health and well-being of children and families, and defending the Constitution of Maine and the Constitution of the United States,\" Mills responded in a statement Wednesday. \"My Administration and Maine's Attorney General will vigorously defend our state against the action announced today from the Department of Justice,\" she said.",
      "Earlier, she downplayed the issue of transgender athletes participating in girls' and women's sporting events.",
      "\"Because there are two, maybe two, trans athletes competing in Maine schools right now, they decided to shut off funding for the school nutrition program, the school lunch program, entirely,\" Mills said in an interview this week on CBS affiliate WGME. \"The law says if you don't like what a state is doing over here, you can't just take the funds away over here.\"",
      "In February, meeting with the nation's governors at the White House, Trump discussed his executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports and asked Mills directly, \"Are you not going to comply with that?\"",
      "She responded that she would comply with state and federal laws.",
      "\"Well, I'm -- we are the federal law,\" Trump said, adding, \"Well, you better do it. You better do it because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't.\"",

      "\"Good,\" Trump replied. \"I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be an easy one. And enjoy your life after governor, because I don't think you'll be in elected politics.\"",

      "From unilaterally freezing federal funding to the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport noncitizens, the clashes have raised concerns about the separation of powers and the potential for a constitutional crisis.",
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration have alleged the government violated or ignored court orders on at least six different occasions, but no judge so far has held a member of the Trump administration in contempt of court. On at least four occasions, judges have expressed concerns about the Trump administration's compliance with court orders.",
      "Lawyers with the Justice Department have vigorously defended the actions of the Trump administration and argued that federal officials have strictly complied with lawful court orders, while also questioning the legality of some orders. Each of the cases are ongoing or being appealed, so the district court orders may be vacated as higher courts weigh in.",

      "\"Well, I always abide by the courts and then I'll have to appeal it,\" Trump told ABC's Rachel Scott in February, referencing cases involving Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. In those cases, Trump suggested a judge's order \"slowed down the momentum, and it gives crooked people more time to cover up the books.

      "The Trump Administration now faces arguably its most high-profile legal battle, as it attempts to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Salvadoran custody despite the Supreme Court ordering his administration to facilitate his release.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration removed more than 100 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to a Salvadoran prison under the Alien Enemies Act despite a federal judge ordering they be returned to the U.S.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued a directive that two planes carrying the men to El Salvador be returned to the United States on March 15. Despite both planes still being in the air at the time of the order, the planes landed in Honduras before flying to El Salvador.",

      "The Supreme Court vacated his order blocking any future removals under the Alien Enemies Act because the plaintiffs lacked jurisdiction to bring a case in D.C. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, Judge Boasberg was considering beginning contempt proceedings.",
      "Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act \u2013 telling reporters last month that he has the authority to remove noncitizens under the law \u2013 and has repeatedly criticized Judge Boasberg for blocking the removals.",

      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling, the Trump administration has doubled down on its allegation that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13 -- without providing any evidence -- and claimed it lacks the authority to return him to the U.S. During a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele told reporters that he lacks the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.",
      "\"The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?\" Bukele said.",
      "Benjamin Osorio, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, told ABC News that he believes the Trump administration is defying the court's order and that a contempt order might be the only thing to prompt the U.S. government to return his client from El Salvador.",
      "Before his meeting with Bukele, Trump told reporters that he would respect an order from the Supreme Court to return Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court,\" Trump said.",
      "During a hearing last week, a federal judge gave lawyers with the Justice Department two weeks to provide more information about three recent removals of noncitizens to El Salvador that took place two days after he issued a temporary order blocking similar deportations to countries other than their place of origin without a hearing to raise concerns about their safety.",
      "Judge Brian Murphy described the \"potential violations of the temporary restraining order\" as \"concerning\" and set an April 28 hearing to learn more about the deportations.",

      "Two days after Judge Murphy temporarily blocked the deportations, the Trump administration announced that it had removed 17 alleged members of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to the plaintiffs, some of the men on those flights had final orders of removal to Venezuela and were never given the right to challenge their removal to El Salvador.",
      "In February, U.S. District Judge John McConnell said that a group of state attorneys general presented evidence that the Trump administration \"continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds\" to states despite a \"clear and unambiguous\" order barring them from blocking the funding.",
      "He ordered the government to \"immediately restore frozen funding\" though the state attorneys general later provided evidence that the Trump administration continued to pause funding from FEMA. Many of the funding streams were restored in the months following Judge McConnell's order.",
      "Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued the limiting of funds was a lawful way to identify and limit alleged fraud.",
      "Two months after Judge McConnell ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze funding to states, he determined that the government \"covertly\" paused millions of dollars in FEMA funding in direct violation of a court order.",
      "Judge McConnell ordered the Trump Administration to \"immediately cease\" its efforts to impede the disbursement of federal funds, finding the government directly violated his order.",
      "Last month, a coalition of 22 attorneys general asked Judge McConnell to stop the freeze after they presented evidence that FEMA continued to restrict more than 215 federal grants despite a court order blocking Trump's unilateral funding freeze.",
      "Lawyers with the DOJ pushed back on the request, arguing that FEMA was \"merely implementing a manual review process\" of each grant.",
      "Judge McConnell disagreed, finding that the states presented \"undisputed evidence\" that FEMA \"essentially [imposed] an indefinite categorical pause on payments\" in direct violation of his preliminary injunction. He said the manual review process cited by the Trump administration \"violates\" a preliminary injunction issued in the case.",
      "A federal judge in February determined that the Trump administration was improperly withholding nearly $2 billion in foreign aid despite an order to restore the funding.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali blocked the Trump administration from imposing a blanket freeze on funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, yet the freeze continued for weeks, according to lawyers representing the foreign aid nonprofits. Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued the funding freeze was necessary to identify and block potential fraud.",
      "In an order, Judge Ali wrote that the Trump administration justified the freeze by advancing \"an unbridled view of Executive power that the Supreme Court has consistently rejected\u2014a view that flouts multiple statutes.\"",
      "After the Trump administration appealed the order, a divided U.S. Supreme Court denied the request to block the order, though the justices ordered the lower court to clarify its original order.",

Members would be officially dismissed April 30.",
      "AmeriCorps did not respond Wednesday to an AP email seeking comment.",
      "AmeriCorps NCCC, which completed its 30th year last year, employs more than 2,000 people ages 18 to 26 participating for a roughly 10-month service term, according to the program\u2019s website.

      "The agency pays for volunteers' basic expenses, including housing, meals and a \u201climited health benefit,\u201d as well as a \u201cmodest\u201d living allowance, according to the program. The program also provided members who complete their 1,700-hour service term with funding for future education expenses or to apply to certain student loans. That benefit was worth about $7,300 this service year.",
      "Funding for AmeriCorps and NCCC has long been scrutinized when Congress talks of budget trims. The federal agency\u2019s budget showed NCCC funding amounted to nearly $38 million last fiscal year.",

      "\u201cThey were not young people who had been striving to be service members somewhere,\u201d Raftery said. \u201cThey were looking for an opportunity to improve their life. They were looking for an opportunity to build some skills, and to be part of a community.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The General Services Administration has a key role in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to slash costs and bring the federal government to heel",
      "WASHINGTON -- On the rooftop patio of the General Services Administration headquarters, an agency staffer recently discovered something strange: a rectangular device attached to a wire that snaked across the roof, over the ledge and into the administrator\u2019s window one floor below.",
      "It didn\u2019t take long for the employee \u2014 an IT specialist \u2014 to figure out the device was a transceiver that communicates with Elon Musk\u2019s vast and private Starlink satellite network. Concerned that the equipment violated federal laws designed to protect public data, staffers reported the discovery to superiors and the agency\u2019s internal watchdog.",
      "The Starlink equipment raises a host of questions about what Musk and his efficiency czars are doing at GSA, an obscure agency that is playing an outsized role in the Trump administration\u2019s quest to slash costs and bring the federal government to heel.",
      "Among other clues that GSA is a critical cog in Musk's stated efforts to slash billions of dollars in federal spending: people with ties to the entrepreneur or his companies hold key jobs at the agency. Its acting administrator is a Silicon Valley tech executive with expertise in rolling out artificial intelligence tools and a wife who once worked for Musk at his social media company, X.",
      "An engineer at Tesla, the billionaire\u2019s electric car company, runs the GSA\u2019s technology division. And one of Musk\u2019s trusted lieutenants is helping to spearhead the work of downsizing the government\u2019s real estate footprint.",
      "GSA oversees many of Uncle Sam\u2019s real estate transactions, collecting and paying rent on behalf of almost every federal agency. It helps manage billions in federal contracts. And it assists other agencies in building better websites and digital tools for citizens.",
      "It is so important because it is \u201ca choke point for all agencies,\u201d said Steven Schooner, a George Washington University law school professor who specializes in government contracting. \u201cThey can, in effect, stop all civilian agencies from purchasing, period. That\u2019s everything.\u201d",
      "In a statement in early March, GSA said it planned to get rid of \u201cnon-core assets\u201d and welcomed \u201ccreative solutions, including sale-lease backs, ground leases and other forms of public/private partnerships.\u201d",
      "The search for those cuts has engulfed the entire 12,000-person agency. At the helm of that push is the GSA\u2019s acting administrator, Stephen Ehikian, the tech executive whose wife worked for X.",
      "\u201cGSA was built for this moment,\u201d Ehikian told employees last month in a meeting, a video of which was viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis agency is the backbone of federal government operations,\u201d said Ehikian, who is seeking to expand automation \u2014 through the use of artificial intelligence \u2014 of many GSA functions. \u201cWe literally have an impact on the administration\u2019s mandate right now, which is around efficiency.\u201d",
      "Another close Musk adviser \u2014 Nicole Hollander \u2014 is driving the initiative to unload the government\u2019s real estate. Her husband, Steve Davis, is acting as the de facto leader of the Musk-inspired Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Hollander, who studied business and real estate at George Washington University, is a licensed property manager in Washington, according to LinkedIn. Her profile also lists her as an employee of X since 2023.",
      "In early March, the GSA real estate division released a list of hundreds of government-owned or leased properties it sought to sell in a frenzied rush.",
      "The list drew sharp criticism from Democrats and civil society groups because it proposed the sale of the Justice Department headquarters and included at least one undisclosed Central Intelligence Agency facility. GSA quickly withdrew the list.",
      "That did not stall DOGE's fire sale. In the presentation viewed by the AP, Ehikian said the agency has canceled more than 680 leases, listed or sold at least 32 properties worth $185 million and cut more than $50 billion in contracts.",
      "Hollander has mostly operated behind the scenes. She rarely appears in Zoom meetings, according to employees. Documents obtained by the AP show spreadsheets she creates are stripped of her name and replaced with a more generic \u201cGSA leadership.\u201d",
      "The AP also obtained copies of some event invitations on Hollander\u2019s calendar. They showed Hollander had several meetings with commercial real estate and services firms, including a brokerage firm and a real estate consulting company that helps companies economize their space. She also took meetings with a consortium of Washington technology companies.",
      "Hollander did not respond to a request for comment sent over LinkedIn or through a GSA spokesperson.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time that Hollander has led a cost-cutting campaign for Musk. A lawsuit brought by fired Twitter employees in 2023 alleged that Hollander and Davis were part of a \u201ccadre of sycophants\u201d who were particularly zealous in implementing Musk\u2019s mandate overhaul of the social media company.",
      "The suit claimed the pair, following their boss\u2019 orders, circumvented San Francisco building and safety codes, ignored their obligation to pay vendors and landlords and downsized without regard to the turmoil it caused employees or customers.",
      "The couple, the lawsuit alleged, also lived at Twitter headquarters with their month-old child, mirroring Musk, who has a reputation for living at his company offices. That pattern appears to be repeating at GSA: Hollander has installed cots on the agency\u2019s sixth floor, according to employees.",
      "Attorneys for Musk and X have moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the Delaware federal court lacks jurisdiction and the lawsuit is legally groundless.",
      "Another employee installed by the Trump administration at GSA worked for Musk at Tesla.",
      "Shortly after taking over GSA\u2019s technology unit, Thomas Shedd told his workforce the goal was to \u201cmove fast and make changes,\u201d according to a transcript of the February meeting obtained by the AP. That's a variation on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s motto of moving fast and breaking things.",
      "Shedd soon began demanding access to sensitive systems that enable the public to communicate or interact with government services, according to staffers who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisal.",
      "Shedd\u2019s request prompted pushback from existing GSA staff. One employee resigned rather than give Shedd access, according to 404 Media.",
      "He also told staff he wanted to consolidate all the government contracts in a centralized database to more easily figure out which ones to eliminate, according to a transcript of the meeting. It\u2019s not clear if he accomplished that goal. Shedd did not reply to emails seeking comment.",
      "He and other GSA officials have also sought to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence. In March, employees were given a demo of a new internal AI chatbot that is designed to more speedily identify contracts and real estate that can be jettisoned. Government agencies like GSA have been hesitant to deploy AI in such ways due to data-security and privacy concerns, according to current and former officials.",
      "It\u2019s not known what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Starlink is playing in GSA\u2019s technological evolution.",
      "On the GSA roof, employees found at least two transceivers, including the one with a wire running to the administrator\u2019s office. It is not clear why the agency is using Starlink. The network provides internet service but is not generally approved for use in most government computer systems.",
      "IT staffers, who reported the discovery to superiors, were concerned that the devices were not authorized to be used at GSA and DOGE might be utilizing them to siphon off agency data, according to internal emails obtained by the AP and a GSA employee who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.",
      "GSA\u2019s IT staff opened an investigation to see if the terminals were a security threat, and an employee filed a complaint with the GSA\u2019s inspector general, the emails show. The status of those probes could not be determined.",
      "The AP obtained photos \u2014 taken by a GSA employee \u2014 of the transceivers. And an AP staffer, using a telephoto lens, confirmed that a wire runs from the roof to a window to the administrator\u2019s office. NBC reported that several DOGE staffers working out of GSA had begun using Starlink terminals in February. It\u2019s unclear if they\u2019re the same terminals referred for investigation by IT staff in March.",
      "A GSA spokesman confirmed the presence of Starlink transceivers but said they were not connected \u201cto GSA\u2019s internal network, nor was there a security breach.\u201d",
      "To many veterans of the agency, the irony of DOGE\u2019s slash-and-burn approach to GSA is that it is jeopardizing one of the agency\u2019s longstanding missions: improving government efficiency.",
      "The agency, for example, had an in-house consulting shop that during the first Trump administration focused on improving government services, especially those relying on technology. Among its initiatives, the team helped create systems to allow Americans to file taxes online and was working to improve online passport renewal.",
      "In the early weeks of the second Trump administration, DOGE officials gutted the team. Shedd defended that move, telling employees in a meeting that the team was eliminated because its work was not cost-effective, according to a transcript of his remarks.",
      "Any reduction in headcount could also jeopardize the government\u2019s ability to police contracts once they are issued to keep costs down.",
      "Such decisions have baffled those who have tracked GSA\u2019s work.",
      "Amira Boland, a behavioral scientist at GSA during the first Trump administration, said that trimming government was a good idea but described some of DOGE\u2019s cuts as \u201creckless.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is certainly bureaucracy that needs to be eliminated,\u201d Boland said, \u201cbut you have to know the stakes you\u2019re playing with.\u201d",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- North Dakota's governor signed a bill Wednesday to prohibit the unusual voting system used by his state's largest city.",
      "The bill signed by Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong bans ranked-choice and approval voting. Ranked-choice voting, in which voters rank their preferred candidates, is used in Alaska and Maine and various cities, but not in North Dakota. Voters select as many candidates as they want under approval voting; the top vote-getters win.",
      "Fargo adopted approval voting via ballot initiative in 2018 and uses the system for electing the mayor and four city commissioners. The measure came after previous elections in which candidates won commission seats with just slivers of the overall vote in crowded races.",
      "In 2018, before approval voting, the winning commission candidates received 18% and 16.5% of the vote, respectively. In the 2024 commission race, the two winners had support from 46% and 44.5% of voters. Three city elections have used approval voting.",
      "Supporters, including Mayor Tim Mahoney, say approval voting works for Fargo. But the bill sponsor, Republican Rep. Ben Koppelman of West Fargo, said the system prefers \u201cvanilla\u201d candidates who don't take hard stances. Republican Secretary of State Michael Howe supported the bill, saying North Dakota needs uniform elections.",
      "In a statement, the governor said: \u201cNow more than ever, we need a consistent, efficient and easy-to-understand voter experience across our entire state to maintain trust in our election system.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Gov. Doug Burgum vetoed a bill from Koppelman to ban Fargo's system. He called the bill state overreach and a blatant infringement on local control. The House overrode the veto but the Senate sustained it.",
      "Fargo's mayor said city officials saw the end result coming, given the Legislature's strong support for the bill.",
      "\u201cThe people of Fargo liked approval voting. It worked for us, but we accept the legislative body. We accept the decision they made,\" Mahoney said.",

      "The showdown between the Trump administration and Harvard University is spotlighting bare-knuckled politics and big dollar figures",
      "NEW YORK -- The showdown between the Trump administration and Harvard University is spotlighting bare-knuckled politics and big dollar figures. But in the battle of the moment, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of a decades-long alliance between the U.S. government and the nation\u2019s most prominent universities, forged to fight a world war.",
      "For eight decades, that interdependence has been prized by academic leaders and politicians of both parties as a paragon for American discovery and innovation.",
      "\u201cIn some ways I think it\u2019s a core part of the story of contemporary America,\u201d said Jason Owen-Smith, a University of Michigan professor who studies the scope of research on the nation\u2019s campuses. \u201cHarvard\u2019s an exemplar, but it\u2019s not the only one.\u201d",
      "That explains the more than $2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts to Harvard frozen this week by administration officials after the school defied their demands to limit activism on campus.",
      "The grants are testament to a system that has its roots in the early 1940s, when the U.S. government began securing cutting edge research through a singular partnership. Federal officials provided money and oversight; institutions, led by big state and private universities, used those billions of dollars to plumb the unknowns of science and technology, while training new generations of researchers.",
      "The partnership delivered wartime innovations including the development of radar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, decades later, the birth at Stanford University of what became Google.",
      "Now the Trump administration is trying something many other chief executives have avoided: imposing ideology on a partnership that has long balanced accountability with independence.",
      "\u201cA lot of Americans are wondering why their tax dollars are going to these universities when they are not only indoctrinating our nation\u2019s students, but also allowing such egregious illegal behavior to occur,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing with reporters this week.",
      "But longtime observers of the partnership between government and universities see the administration's actions very differently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been politicized the way the Trump administration is doing it because it\u2019s always had bipartisan support,\u201d says Roger Geiger, a historian of higher education who is retired from Penn State. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual that we don\u2019t see that support now.\u201d",
      "Cutting off Harvard follows similar moves at Columbia and other prominent universities to force compliance. At the same time, Johns Hopkins University surrendered more than $800 million in federal grants for health and medical programs it administers after the administration began dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development and cut funding by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "The dollar figures for use in domestic laboratories and programs overseas might seem surprising to a public most familiar with big universities as centers of teaching and student life.",
      "But to make sense of the current battle, it helps to understand how government and universities came to be so interdependent.",
      "A century ago, a much smaller community of research universities relied largely on private funding. But as U.S. officials scrambled to prepare for entry into World War II in 1940, a former MIT dean, Vannevar Bush, pitched President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the critical need to marshal defense research by partnering government with scientists at universities and other institutions.",
      "\u201cUrgency in the 1940s was really the overriding motivation,\u201d said G. Pascal Zachary, author of a biography of Bush. \u201cBut the structure proved durable.\u201d",
      "Bush\u2019s agency oversaw the quest for the first nuclear weapons, developed at a laboratory administered by the University of California. And when fighting ended, he prevailed on Roosevelt to expand the research partnership to ensure national security, foster scientific and medical discovery, and grow the economy.",
      "\u201cIt is only the colleges, universities, and a few research institutes that devote most of their research efforts to expanding the frontiers of knowledge,\u201d Bush wrote in a 1945 report to Roosevelt, laying out his plan.",
      "Federal funding for research remained limited, however, until the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite in 1957. Determined to catch up, U.S. lawmakers approved a stream of funding for university research and training of new scientists.",
      "\u201cWe were locked into the Cold War, this battle with the Soviet Union, that was in many ways a scientific and technological battle,\u201d said Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Research schools, which number between 150 and 200, used the inflow of federal dollars to build labs and other infrastructure. That growth came as enrollment climbed, with the government\u2019s paying for veterans to attend college through the G.I. Bill and measures in the 1960s to help poorer students.",
      "The partnership between government and universities has always come with a built-in tension.",
      "Federal officials were at the helm, awarding money to projects that meet their priorities and tracking the results. But it is explicit that government officials do not control the work itself, allowing researchers to independently pursue answers to questions and problems, even if they don\u2019t always find them.",
      "\u201cThe government gets to basically treat a generally decentralized national system of universities as a pay-as-you-go resource to get problems solved,\u201d Michigan\u2019s Owen-Smith said.",
      "With that understanding, universities have become the recipient of about 90 percent of all federal research funds, taking in $59.6 billion in 2023, according to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.",
      "That accounts for more than half the $109 billion spent on research at universities, with most of the rest coming from the school themselves, state and local government and nonprofits.",
      "Johns Hopkins has been the single largest grantee, accounting for $3.3 billion in federal spending in 2023. Federal dollars for research at the University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, UC San Diego and Michigan also exceeded more than $1 billion each. Harvard received about $640 million.",
      "Moves by the Trump administration to close agencies and impose changes on campuses present universities with an unprecedented threat.",
      "\u201cGenerations of Hopkins researchers have brought the benefits of discovery to the world,\u201d the school\u2019s president, Ronald J. Daniels, wrote recently. \u201cHowever, a fast and far-reaching cascade of cuts to federal research funding across higher education is badly fraying this long-standing compact.\u201d",
      "The partnership is supposed to be protected by guardrails. Rules specify that officials who believe a school is violating the law can\u2019t just cut funding but must instead present details of alleged violations to Congress.",
      "But the Trump administration, bent on making schools change policies designed to encourage diversity on campuses and crack down on protests, is ignoring those rules, Zimmerman said.",
      "Funding cuts will likely put pressure on schools\u2019 remaining resources, leaving them with less money for things like financial aid to students of modest means, he said. But the bigger danger is to academic freedom of schools to teach and do research as they see fit.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s remember that in the past three months we\u2019ve seen people\" at universities \"scrubbing their websites for references to certain words,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens in authoritarian countries.\u201d",

      "Health secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warned that children in the U.S. are being diagnosed with autism at an \u201calarming rate,\u201d promising on Wednesday to conduct exhaustive studies to identify any environmental factors that may cause the developmental disorder.",
      "His call comes the day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that found an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children have autism, a marked increase from 2020.",
      "\u201cAutism destroys families,\" Kennedy said. \"More importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children. These are children who should not be suffering like this.\u201d",
      "Kennedy described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease,\u201d although researchers and scientists have identified genetic factors that are associated with it. Autism is not considered a disease, but a complex disorder that affects the brain. Cases range widely in severity, with symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. Some autistic traits can go unnoticed well into adulthood.",
      "Those who have spent decades researching autism have found no single cause. Besides genetics, scientists have identified various possible factors, including the age of a child\u2019s father, the mother\u2019s weight, and whether she had diabetes or was exposed to certain chemicals.",
      "Kennedy said his wide-ranging plan to determine the cause of autism will look at all of those environmental factors, and others. He had previously set a September deadline for determining what causes autism, but said Wednesday that by then, his department will determine at least \u201csome\u201d of the answers.",
      "The effort will involve issuing grants to universities and researchers, Kennedy said. He said the researchers will be encouraged to \u201cfollow the science, no matter what it says.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has recently canceled billions of dollars in grants for health and science research sent to universities.",
      "The CDC\u2019s latest autism data was from 14 states and Puerto Rico in 2022. The previous estimate \u2014 from 2020 \u2014 was 1 in 36.",
      "Boys continue to be diagnosed more than girls, and the highest rates are among children who are Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and Black.",
      "To estimate how common autism is, the CDC checked health and school records for 8-year-olds, because most cases are diagnosed by that age. Other researchers have their own estimates, but experts say the CDC\u2019s estimate is the most rigorous and the gold standard.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy criticized theories that the rise in autism cases can be attributed to more awareness about the disorder. Autism researchers have cited heightened awareness, as well as medical advancements and increased diagnoses of mild cases.",
      "\u201cThe reasons for increases in autism diagnosis come down to scientific and health care progress,\u201d said Annette Estes, director of the autism center at the University of Washington. \"It's hard for many people to understand this because the causes of autism are complex.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates, Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFor the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\u201d on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "The sharp volatility in financial markets since President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors. Yet the Fed is unlikely to intervene unless there is a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities or other malfunctions, economists say.",
      "In written remarks to be delivered to the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \u201csignificantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\u201cThe same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d he said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \u201ccould also be more persistent,\u201d echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \u201csooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

Homeowners fear the change will bring unaffordable tax increases, threatening one of America's most historically and culturally unique Black communities.",
      "The Georgia Supreme Court heard legal arguments Wednesday on whether residents can attempt to repeal the 2023 zoning amendments by forcing a special election.",
      "Hogg Hummock residents and their supporters last year gathered more than 2,300 petition signatures from registered voters seeking a referendum in the coastal county 60 miles (96 kilometers) south of Savannah.",

      "The issues before the Georgia Supreme Court have nothing to do with whether Hogg Hummock deserves special protections. Instead, the justices are being asked to deal with technicalities over whether local zoning laws can be challenged by referendum and whether McIntosh County commissioners had a right to sue to stop the October vote.",
      "The case follows a 2023 ruling by the Georgia justices that upheld a referendum that blocked coastal Camden County from building a launchpad for commercial rockets. The court ruled that a rarely used provision of Georgia's constitution empowers citizens to veto county government decisions at the ballot box.",
      "That decision emboldened Hogg Hummock residents to pursue their own referendum to overturn McIntosh County's zoning changes.",
      "But attorneys for the county commissioners have argued the constitutional provision allowing citizen referendums doesn't apply to local zoning decisions, because zoning powers are addressed in a separate section of the state constitution. They also say the trial court judge was wrong to put the zoning changes on hold pending a ruling by state Supreme Court, which could take six months.",
      "Lawyers for the Hogg Hummock residents say the referendum shouldn't have been interrupted and that county commissioners had no legal standing to sue to stop it, citing the high court's ruling in the spaceport case.",

      "\u201cBecause of this mistreatment, he has been worn down considerably health wise, and now faces the stress of trial in this condition, which may very well lead to serious health complications, even death,\u201d Ansari said.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber has yet to rule on the transfer request, and the issue wasn't discussed in court before jury selection resumed on Wednesday morning.",
      "The first day ended on Tuesday with no one chosen for the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates. Wednesday kicked off with two dozen prospective jurors being brought to the courtroom for more questioning after making it through an initial round a day earlier.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial. He\u2019s accused of raping an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and a criminal sex act by forcing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006.",
      "He is also charged with one count of criminal sex act based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the original trial. That woman, who has asked not to be named publicly, alleges that Weinstein forced oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",

      "U.S. shoppers increased their shopping last month, fueled by a spending spree on foreign-made new big ticket items from gadgets to cars before President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive new tariffs started kicking in",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. shoppers stepped up their shopping last month, fueled by a spending spree on big ticket items from gadgets to cars before President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive new tariffs started kicking in.",
      "Retail sales rose 1.4% in March, after rising 0.2% in February, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales fell 1.2% in January, hurt in part by cold weather that kept more Americans indoors, denting sales at car dealers and most other stores.",
      "Excluding sales at dealers of autos and parts, sales only rose 0.5% in March, compared with the previous month.",
      "Sales at dealers of autos and parts rose 5.3%, and the report also underscored strength elsewhere. Electronics retailers had a 0.8% increase while sporting goods retailers enjoyed a 2.4% gain. Grocery stores saw a 0.1% increase and clothing and accessories stores had a 0.4% increase. Online retailers posted a 0.1% gain and restaurants had a 1.8% increase. However, furniture and home furnishings stores posted a 0.7% decline.",
      "\u201cThese are simply blow out numbers on March retail sales where the rush is on like this is one gigantic clearance sale,\u201d said Christopher S. Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBonds LLC in a published note. \u201cConsumers are expecting sharply higher prices the next year and are clearing the store shelves and picking up bargains while they can. \u201d",
      "Analysts expect that sales will start falling off as the slew of tariffs increase costs for companies and many retailers are forced to raise prices, hurting shopper demand. Consumers\u2019 confidence has already taken a hit. And a growing number of retailers and suppliers are halting shipments from China as well as pausing orders as they wait to see where the tariffs settle. In some cases, they are canceling orders.",
      "The result of the trade wars so far: a baseline tariff on most countries of 10%, with imports from China getting taxed at a combined 145%. Goods from Canada and Mexico face tariffs of up to 25%, while imported autos, steel and aluminum are taxed at that same rate. China retaliated last week with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "Early this month, Trump announced sweeping and steep tariffs on nearly all trading partners. But after Trump\u2019s U- turn last week that paused the new tariffs on about 60 nations for 90 days, average U.S. duties remain much higher than a couple of months ago.",
      "Last Friday, the Trump administration announced tariff exemptions on electronics like smartphones and laptops but a few days later said they\u2019re only a temporary reprieve.",
      "Amid lots of uncertainty, U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in April, the fourth consecutive month of drops, in a seemingly sharp disapproval of Trump\u2019s trade wars that have fueled anxiety over possible job cuts and rising inflation.",
      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, fell 11% on a monthly basis to 50.8, the lowest since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a global logistics company based in San Francisco, said that he has seen that the companies that he works with have already raised prices by 5% to 10%.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see it likely play out even more because these tariffs haven\u2019t even washed through the system yet, \u201c he said. \u201dSo once the goods are arriving paying the higher duties people have no choice but to raise prices to accommodate for that.\"",
      "He added that it's become hard for companies to make investments and set up a supply network.",
      "\u201cIt could all just change in an instant,\u201d he said. \"This is not how business works. We need more certainty before we can invest.\"",
      "Analysts say that the big retailers will be able to navigate better than the smaller ones, which don\u2019t have the clout to absorb extra costs or pressure their suppliers. But it also depends on the type of goods they sell, particularly if they have goods sources from overseas.",
      "Ashley Hetrick, principal and sourcing and supply chain segment leader at accounting firm BDO, noted that stores are taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach when it comes to ordering goods and are more cautious about ordering seasonal items because they have a shorter shelf life. She said that the cancelling of orders hasn't been widespread.",
      "Walmart executives offered a dose of confidence last week that the retailer will keep delivering low prices as it navigates Trump\u2019s escalating trade wars with China.",
      "But the nation\u2019s largest retailer, whose competitive prices became a strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, told analysts that it\u2019s still vulnerable to the challenges and is monitoring the fluid tariff situation. The company told analysts that sales have been volatile.",
      "\u201cWhile in the short term, we\u2019re not immune to the effects, we are positioned to play offense,\u201d Walmart\u2019s CEO Doug McMillon said at an investor meeting.",
      "Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy said last week that the company has been doing everything it can to keep prices low for customers, including bringing in goods early ahead of the barrage of tariffs and negotiating with suppliers.",
      "But Jassy told CNBC\u2019s Andrew Sorkin Thursday that its network of third-party sellers will have to pass on the higher costs to sellers.",
      "Jassy said that he hadn't seen a notable change in consumer behavior since Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs. And while he sees that some shoppers are stocking up ahead of price increases, the data is limited and he was not sure how broad-based that behavior is.",
      "But according to Bloomreach, which tracks sales from more than 1,000 global brands and retailers overall, North American e-commerce revenue marginally increased 0.4% during the week of March 31 compared with the first week of March. But sales increased 6% between the week of March 24 and the week of March 31.",
      "Online sales in apparel increased 44.8% during the week of March 31 compared with the first week of March, according to Bloomreach.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that his state will file a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.",
      "The suit will argue that Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China or a 10% tariff on all imports is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.",
      "The lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will also argue that enacting such tariffs requires approval from Congress, Newsom's office said in a news release.",
      "Trump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country. California's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration.",
      "Newsom says the tariffs in effect have resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage in California, which has the largest economy among U.S. states and is a massive exporter.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy \u2014 driving up prices and threatening jobs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re standing up for American families who can\u2019t afford to let the chaos continue.\u201d",
      "Newsom will discuss the lawsuit alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta later Wednesday in the farm-rich Central Valley. California is a farming powerhouse, with many of the nuts, fruits and vegetables the state grows destined for other countries.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Thirty years after a truck bomb detonated outside a federal building in America's heartland, killing 168 people in the deadliest homegrown attack on U.S. soil, deep scars remain.",
      "From a mother who lost her first-born baby, a son who never got to know his father, and a young man so badly injured that he still struggles to breathe, three decades have not healed the wounds from the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995.",
      "The bombers were two former U.S. Army buddies, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, who shared a deep-seated hatred of the federal government fueled by the bloody raid on the Branch Davidian religious sect near Waco, Texas, and a standoff in the mountains of Ruby Ridge, Idaho, that killed a 14-year-old boy, his mother and a federal agent.",
      "And while the bombing awakened the nation to the dangers of extremist ideologies, many who suffered directly in the attack still fear anti-government rhetoric in modern-day politics could also lead to violence.",
      "A 30-year anniversary remembrance ceremony is scheduled for April 19 on the grounds of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum.",
      "Little Baylee Almon had just celebrated her first birthday the day before her mother, Aren Almon, dropped her off at the America's Kids Daycare inside the Alfred P. Murrah federal building. It was the last time Aren would see her first child alive.",

      "\u201cI said: \u2018That\u2019s Baylee.' I knew it was her,\u201d Aren Almon said. She called her pediatrician, who confirmed the news.",
      "In the hauntingly iconic image, which won the amateur photographer who took it the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography, firefighter Chris Shields came to symbolize all the first responders who descended on the bomb site, while Baylee represented the innocent victims who were lost that day.",
      "But for Aren, her daughter was more than a symbol.",
      "\u201cI get that (the photo) made its mark on the world,\u201d Almon said. \u201cBut I also realize that Baylee was a real child. She wasn't just a symbol, and I think that gets left out a lot.\u201d",
      "The Oklahoma City firefighter in the photograph was Chris Fields, who had been on the scene for about an hour when a police officer came \u201cout of nowhere\u201d and handed him Baylee's lifeless body.",
      "Fields swept the infant's airway and checked for any signs of life. He found none.",
      "He said the iconic photograph was snapped as he waited for a paramedic to find room for the baby in a crowded ambulance.",
      "\u201cI was just looking down at Baylee thinking, \u2018Wow, somebody\u2019s world is getting ready to be turned upside down today,'\u201d Fields recalled.",

      "One of the youngest survivors of the bombing was PJ Allen, who was just 18 months old when his grandmother dropped him off at the second-floor daycare. He still bears the scars from his injuries.",
      "Allen suffered second- and third-degree burns over more than half his body, a collapsed lung, smoke damage to both lungs, head trauma from falling debris and damage to his vocal chords that still affects the sound of his voice.",
      "Now an avionics technician at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City, Allen said he had to be homeschooled for years and couldn't go out in the sun because of the damage to his skin.",

      "\u201cAround this time of year, April, it makes me very appreciative that I wake up every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI know some people weren\u2019t as fortunate.\u201d",
      "Austin Allen was 4 years old when his father, Ted L. Allen, a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development employee, died in the bombing. He never truly got to know his dad.",
      "Although he remembers snippets of riding in his dad's truck and eating Cheerios with him in the morning, most of his memories come from friends and family.",

      "Health secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- As measles outbreaks popped up across the U.S. this winter, pediatricians waited for the nation's public health agency to send a routine, but important, letter that outlines how they could help stop the spread of the illness.",
      "It wasn't until last week \u2014 after the number of cases grew to more than 700, and a second young child in Texas had died from a measles infection \u2014 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally issued its correspondence.",
      "The delay of that letter may seem minor. But it is one in a string of missteps that more than a dozen doctors, nurses and public health officials interviewed by The Associated Press identified in the Trump administration's response to the outbreak.",
      "Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to contain an epidemic in a tight-knit, religious community in West Texas have run counter to established public health strategies deployed to end past epidemics.",
      "\u201cWhat we are lacking now is one, clear strong voice \u2014 from the federal to the state to the local \u2014 saying that the vaccine is the only thing that will prevent measles,\" said Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse and infectious disease expert who helped stop a 2017 measles outbreak in Minnesota's Somali community.",
      "Behind the scenes, Kennedy has not been regularly briefed in person on the outbreak by his own infectious disease experts at the CDC at least through March 21, according to Kevin Griffis, a career staffer who worked as the agency's communications director until he resigned that day.",
      "Even after the measles claimed its first young Texas victim in late February, Kennedy had still not been briefed by CDC staff, Griffis said. His account was confirmed by a second former federal health official, who resigned at the end of February.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not answer specific written questions about how he had been briefed or his communications with CDC staff.",
      "The spokesperson said the CDC activated an Atlanta-based response in early February to provide overall guidance on measles testing and vaccination strategy. An on-the-ground team was deployed to West Texas throughout most of March and withdrawn on April 1.",
      "It was a \u201cjoint decision\u201d between state and federal officials to send the team home, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said. Another team of seven was dispatched back to the region this week.",
      "In previous administrations, health secretaries held weekly briefings with CDC staff, lasting between 25 and 30 minutes, during infectious disease outbreaks, both former HHS officials said. Kennedy, instead, received updates on paper or through email, Griffis said.",
      "\u201cThat is extremely unusual,\u201d said Griffis, who sat in on such briefings with the previous health secretary and said that none were held for Kennedy during his first month on the job. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d",
      "In another irregularity, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the nation's largest network of pediatricians, has not been tapped to work with the CDC on the outbreak, according to the organization's officials. Historically, the CDC and AAP have convened for monthly or biweekly briefings during outbreaks to share updates, which include details about what doctors are seeing and questions they're fielding from parents in exam rooms. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the health department's response.",
      "The only updates provided widely to pediatricians by the CDC have come from a health alert network update sent on March 7, a week after the first U.S. measles death in a decade, and the letter sent to providers last week, which, according to the pediatric academy officials, was late in the outbreak.",
      "Kennedy praised the CDC on Tuesday during an event in Indianapolis, saying it \u201chad done a very good job controlling the measles outbreak.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's inconsistent and unclear message on the measles vaccines has also made the outbreaks difficult to contain, experts say.",
      "He has occasionally endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine as \u201ceffective,\u201d but also continues to raise safety concerns about the shots in other statements. In a CBS interview last week, he claimed the vaccines were \u201cnot safety tested.\u201d",
      "That approach has been the biggest flaw of the government's response, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, the president of the Infectious Disease Society of America.",

      "Bedtime routines aren\u2019t just for toddlers",
      "Navigating bedtime with a teenager is, in many homes, a nightly battle with a constant refrain: Get off your phone! Go to bed!",
      "Research shows that today\u2019s teenagers are more sleep-deprived than ever before. Adolescents need between eight and 10 hours of sleep, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But nearly 80% of American teenagers aren\u2019t getting that, and experts say it's affecting important areas like mental health and school attendance.",
      "Bedtime routines aren\u2019t just for toddlers. Teenagers need them too, says Denise Pope, an expert on child development and a senior lecturer at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Education.",
      "Experts in adolescent sleep say a few small changes to how parents and teens approach sleep can make a dramatic difference.",
      "The first step to setting up a better bedtime routine is dealing with technology.",
      "\u2014 Separate children from their devices at night. Phones, tablets, streaming services and video games aren\u2019t the only things keeping kids up at night, but experts agree they are a major factor in delaying sleep.",
      "\u201cGet the temptation out of the bedroom,\u201d Pope says. If the phone is within arm\u2019s reach, it\u2019s hard to ignore when notifications buzz. Many teens say they fall asleep while scrolling, or reach for their phone if they have trouble sleeping, and end up scrolling for hours.",
      "\u2014 Be prepared for excuses. \u201cMy phone is my alarm clock\u201d is something a lot of parents hear. The solution: Buy an alarm clock.",
      "\u2014 Put screens away an hour before bedtime. Exposure to light prevents the release of melatonin, the hormone released by the brain that makes us feel drowsy.",
      "Then, replace screens with a new wind-down routine.",
      "\u2014 Try to get to bed around the same time each night and start winding down at least 30 minutes before. During that time, silence notifications, take a warm shower, read a book. To get an idea of what your teen's bedtime should be, try an online \u201c bedtime calculator,\" such as the one from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.",
      "\u2014 Avoid caffeine and energy drinks in the afternoon and evening.",
      "\u2014 The best sleep environment is a cool, dark, quiet room. In noisy households, earplugs and a sleep mask can help. If a bedroom is too warm, it can affect getting to sleep and staying asleep, says adolescent sleep expert Kyla Wahlstrom.",
      "Some of the telltale evidence of sleep deprivation: being irritable, grumpy, short-tempered, emotionally fragile, unmotivated, impulsive and more likely to see the world and oneself through a negative lens. A sleep-deprived teen also may fall asleep during the daytime, in the car or in class.",
      "\u201cWe often blame adolescents for being lazy or unruly or having bad behavior, much of which could be attributed to the fact that they are chronically sleep-deprived,\u201d says Wendy Troxel, a clinical psychologist who has conducted numerous studies on adolescent sleep.",

      "\u2014 One key sign is what sleep expert Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse calls \u201czombie mornings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf your teen hits snooze five times, takes forever to get out of bed, asks you for a big cup of coffee first thing in the morning, most likely they are running on empty,\" says Fong-Isariyawongse, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh.",
      "\u2014 Extreme mood swings are another sign. Sleep is critical for emotional processing, which is why sleep-deprived teens are more likely to be irritable, anxious or depressed.",
      "\u2014 A sleep-deprived teen may fall behind in school, because sleep is essential for learning and memory consolidation.",
      "\u2014 Teens who sleep less are more likely to make bad choices when it comes to drug or alcohol use, drowsy or reckless driving and risky sexual behavior.",
      "\u2014 Does your teen sleep until lunchtime on weekends? \"Most likely they are not getting enough sleep during the week,\u201d says Fong-Isariyawongse. It\u2019s fine to sleep in a bit, but try to limit it to a couple hours. Otherwise, it throws off the body clock and makes it harder to wake up when the new school week begins.",
      "Explain to your teens why sleep matters, and that it\u2019s not just nagging parents who say so. The data on mental health and sleep is vast.",
      "\u2014 Many studies show that depression, anxiety and the risk of suicidal thinking go up as sleep goes down.",
      "\u2014 Beyond mood, sleep deprivation affects physical and athletic ability. That\u2019s why several NFL and NBA teams have hired sleep coaches. Teens who are sleep-deprived sustain more physical injuries, because they take more risks, their judgment is impaired, and reflexes and reaction times are not as fast. Teens who get more sleep perform better in sports, and when they do get injuries, they have a quicker recovery time.",
      "\u2014 More teenage car accidents come from drowsy driving than driving under the influence of alcohol, studies show. Teens who say they get less than eight hours of sleep a night are more likely to text while driving, not wear a seat belt, drink and drive \u2014 or get in a car with a driver who has been drinking.",
      "As any parent knows, telling their teenager to go to sleep does not always work. You need to get their buy-in.",

    "story": [
      "The White House has put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by the news agencies that serve media outlets around the world",
      "Fresh from a courtroom loss over The Associated Press' access to the presidency, the White House on Tuesday put forward a new media policy that sharply curtails access to Donald Trump by news agencies that serve media outlets around the world. It was the latest attempt by the new administration to control coverage of its activities.",
      "The move would block the AP and other wire services that serve billions of readers through thousands of news outlets. It comes after a judge ruled the White House had violated the organization\u2019s free speech by banning it because it disagreed with the outlet\u2019s decision not to rename the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "While outlining a new \u201cpool coverage\u201d policy for small spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, the White House also said it will ultimately give press secretary Karoline Leavitt the final say over who gets to question her boss, according to people who have seen the plan.",
      "The White House did not return messages for comment on Tuesday evening.",
      "A federal judge last week ruled the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico by blocking its reporters and photographers from covering the events. U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden ordered the administration to treat the AP as it does other news organizations.",
      "A day after defying McFadden's ruling and continuing AP's ban when Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele met with reporters in the Oval Office, the White House leaked a new policy to selected journalists.",
      "For many years, the White House Correspondents Association has run the pool for the limited space events, and each time it has included reporters from the wire services AP, Reuters and Bloomberg. One print reporter was also allowed, selected on a rotating basis from more than 30 news outlets.",
      "The White House now says it will lump the three wire services with print reporters for two slots \u2014 meaning roughly three dozen reporters will rotate for two regular slots. Wire services typically report and write stories that are used in multiple locations around the country and the planet.",
      "Even with the rotation, the White House said Trump's press secretary \u201cshall retain day-to-day discretion to determine composition of the pool.\u201d The new policy says reporters will also be allowed in \u201cirrespective of the substantive viewpoint expressed by an outlet.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the AP's Lauren Easton said the outlet was deeply disappointed that rather than restore the AP's access, the White House instead chose restrictions over all of the wire services.",
      "\u201cThe wire services represent thousands of news organizations across the U.S. and the world over,\u201d said Easton, an AP spokeswoman. \"Our coverage is used by local newspapers and television stations in all 50 states to inform their communities.",
      "\u201cThe administration's actions continue to disregard the fundamental American freedom to speak without government control or retaliation,\u201d Easton said Tuesday night.",
      "The independent White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the administration\u2019s insistence on retaining control over who covers the president shows that it is unwilling to guarantee that it would not continue \u201cviewpoint discrimination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government should not be able to control the independent media that covers it,\u201d said Eugene Daniels, the association\u2019s president.",
      "Under Leavitt, the White House has given greater access to news outlets friendly to Trump. That was visible Tuesday, when the first reporter Leavitt addressed during a briefing asked two questions while also praising Trump policy.",
      "At Monday's Oval Office meeting, Trump bristled at questions from CNN's Kaitlan Collins about a man deported to an El Salvador prison, at one point accusing CNN of \u201chating our country.\u201d He made it a point to contrast her questions with a non-pointed one from another reporter.",
      "Despite the occasional fireworks, Trump has made himself accessible to the media more than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Cramped-quarters events, particularly in the Oval Office, are some of his favorite places to talk \u2014 rendering the new access policy all the more impactful.",
      "The new policy advanced on Tuesday did not address access for photographers. At an earlier court hearing about the AP's case, the outlet's chief White House photographer, Evan Vucci, and correspondent Zeke Miller testified about how the ban has hurt the business of a news agency built to quickly get news and images to its customers.",
      "The dispute stems from AP\u2019s decision not to follow the president\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump\u2019s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. McFadden agreed with AP's argument that the government cannot punish the news organization for what it says \u2014 for exercising its right to free speech.",
      "The White House has argued that press access to the president is a privilege, not a right, that it should control \u2014 much like it decides to whom Trump gives one-on-one interviews. In court papers filed last weekend, his lawyers signaled that even with McFadden's decision, the AP's days of unchallenged access to open presidential events were over.",
      "\u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,\u201d the administration argued. \u201cThe AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d",
      "The administration has appealed McFadden's ruling, and is scheduled to be in an appeals court on Thursday to argue that ruling should be put on hold until the merits of the case are fully decided, perhaps by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The administration has not curtailed AP access to Leavitt's briefings over the past two months. It has blocked access to events in the East Room to White House-credentialed AP reporters \u2014 until Tuesday, when one was allowed into an event that involved the Navy football team.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Rancher Brett Kenzy hopes President Donald Trump's tariffs will make imported beef expensive enough that Americans will turn to cattle raised at home for all their hamburgers and steaks.",
      "That might raise prices enough to give Kenzy and others the incentive they need to expand their herds for the first time in decades. But doing that would take at least two years, and it's not clear if Trump's tariffs on most of the world besides China are high enough to make that worth the investment.",
      "\u201cIf we can just fix a few key things, I think that we can reinvigorate rural America,\u201d said the South Dakota rancher. \u201cJust get these imports under control, get them to a level that we can understand and plan on, and then let us fill the void. And I think that the American rancher can do that.\u201d",
      "Trump has enjoyed overwhelming support in rural parts of the country in his three campaigns for president. Still, the uncertainty created by the trade war he instigated has given some ranchers pause as they've watched cattle prices drop after the tariffs were announced.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t like manipulated markets because somebody is going to artificially win and somebody is going to artificially lose,\u201d said Bryant Kagay, who raises and feeds cattle as well as growing crops on his farm in northwest Missouri. \u201cAnd how do I know it\u2019s not going to be me?\u201d",
      "Ranchers hope the tariffs might create an incentive for them to raise more cattle, and the National Cattlemen trade group is salivating at the idea of selling more cuts of meat overseas if the tariffs lead to new trade deals with countries that don't buy much U.S. beef.",
      "That's a big if \u2014 Trump has said dozens of countries have reached out to negotiate new trade deals, but no agreements have been reached.",
      "About the only thing clear so far is that American ranchers will likely lose one of their biggest markets as a result of the 125% tariffs imposed by China in response to Trump. They sold $1.6 billion worth of beef there last year, and since many ranchers also raise crops, they are reeling about the prospect of losing China as a market for those, too.",
      "Most beef exports to China are already on hold because the certificates from that country that meat plants need weren't renewed at most beef plants in the United States after they expired in March. So the U.S. Meat Export Federation said few American beef plants are even eligible to ship to China right now.",
      "Kenzy hopes Trump's tariffs represent a lasting change in U.S. trade policy. So far the tariffs have been changing so much since they were announced that ranchers can\u2019t count on them yet.",
      "\u201cIf this is just a short-term negotiating tactic \u2014 Tarzan beating his chest \u2014 then I would say that that would be an epic failure because that will not result in reshoring industry,\u201d Kenzy said.",
      "The problem, as Kenzy and other members of the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America see it, is that the more than 4 billion pounds of beef that's imported every year \u2014 along with cattle brought in from other countries to be slaughtered here \u2014 keeps cattle prices lower.",
      "Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced here in the United States to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want. Even though Trump placed most of his proposed tariffs on hold, the across-the-board 10% tariffs he imposed for 90 days will make imported beef more expensive, so consumers are likely to see the price of hamburger increase.",
      "Even if ranchers decided to raise more cattle to help replace those imports, it would take at least two years to breed and raise them. That means meat processors will likely pay higher prices for that imported beef for at least that long. And the ongoing drought across most of the West will continue to make it difficult to raise more cattle.",
      "Plus, if American ranchers want to produce more of that lean beef they might have to change the way they raise their animals because the entire system in this country is designed to produce fattier meat to get deliciously marbled and tender steaks that help ranchers make the most money. Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said most of the lean beef America buys comes from Australia and New Zealand where cattle are fed grass \u2014 not grain \u2014 their entire lives, and that's an entirely different system.",
      "The number of cattle being raised across the country has been shrinking for decades to reach the current historic lows of around 28 million, but Texas A&M livestock economist David Anderson said even though that's less than two-thirds of the number of cattle there were in 1975, more beef \u2014 some 26.7 billion pounds \u2014 was actually produced last year. That's because the American beef industry has become so good at feeding cattle and breeding larger animals that now every head of cattle produces more meat. Anderson said that means there's less incentive to expand the herd.",
      "Casey Maher, owner of the Maher Angus Ranch in Morristown, S.D., said he hopes Trump\u2019s tariffs will level the playing field for American beef producers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic and we\u2019re going to stay the course,\u201d said Maher, a third-generation rancher. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through tough times, and if it\u2019s for the greater good, I think ranchers are all in.\u201d",
      "Not all of them, though. Kagay, the Missouri farmer, said uncertainty causes problems of its own.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not real confident about these tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cWill they stick around? Will they not stick around? Can I count on them? What exactly is going to happen? You know, nobody knows. So it makes it hard for me to plan my business. I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d",
      "That uncertainty could extend well beyond farming and ranching if it creates new fears about the economy as a whole. If consumers buy less beef because they are worried about their grocery budgets, it won't matter how much beef is imported.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re less likely to pay up for a ribeye steak if you\u2019re worried about losing your job,\u201d Tonsor said.",

      "Former President Joe Biden is returning to the national stage to help elevate concerns that President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is threatening the health of Social Security",
      "WASHINGTON -- Former President Joe Biden returns to the national stage Tuesday to elevate liberal concerns that President Donald Trump's agenda is threatening the health of Social Security.",
      "The 82-year-old Democrat has largely avoided speaking publicly since leaving the White House in January. That's even as Trump frequently blames Biden for many of the nation's problems, often attacking his predecessor by name.",
      "Biden is expected to fight back in an early evening speech to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled in Chicago. While Biden has made a handful of public appearances in recent weeks, Tuesday's high-profile address focuses on a critical issue for tens of millions of Americans that could define next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cAs bipartisan leaders have long agreed, Americans who retire after paying into Social Security their whole lives deserve the vital support and caring services they receive,\u201d said Rachel Buck, executive director of the ACRD. \u201cWe are thrilled the president will be joining us to discuss how we can work together for a stable and successful future for Social Security.\u201d",
      "Trump almost immediately began slashing the government workforce upon his return to the White House, including thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Along with a planned layoff of 7,000 workers and controversial plans to impose tighter identity-proofing measures for recipients, the SSA has been sued over a decision to allow Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access individuals\u2019 Social Security numbers and other personally identifiable information.",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and one of Trump\u2019s most influential advisers, has called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Social Security recipients have complained about long call wait times as the agency\u2019s \u201cmy Social Security\u201d benefits portal has seen an increase in outages. Individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income, including disabled seniors and low-income adults and children, also reported receiving a notice that said they were \u201cnot receiving benefits.\u201d",
      "The agency said the notice was a mistake. And the White House has vowed that it would not cut Social Security benefits, saying any changes are intended to reduce waste and fraud.",
      "Biden will be joined in Chicago by a bipartisan group of former elected officials, including former Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., former Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and former Social Security Administrator Martin O\u2019Malley.",
      "\u201cSocial Security is a sacred promise between generations,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \"We are deeply grateful to the President for joining us at ACRD to discuss how we can keep that promise for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Biden is not expected to make frequent public appearances as he transitions into his post-presidency. He still maintains an office in Washington, but has returned to Delaware as his regular home base. Trump has revoked his security clearances.",
      "While Biden may be in position to help his party with fundraising and messaging, he left the White House with weak approval ratings. Biden also faces blame from some progressives who argue he shouldn't have sought a second term. Biden ended his reelection bid after his disastrous debate performance against Trump and made way for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in the fall.",
      "Just 39% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden in January, according to a Gallup poll taken shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Views of the Democratic former president were essentially unchanged from a Gallup poll taken shortly after the November election. They broadly track with the steadily low favorability ratings that Biden experienced throughout the second half of his presidential term.",

      "While revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.",
      "The supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to \u00a34.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".",

      "\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"",
      "Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.",
      "On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.",
      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",
      "What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.",
      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",
      "In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.",
      "\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.",
      "According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"",
      "His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"",
      "The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.",
      "However, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.",
      "\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"",
      "Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.",
      "The last of these happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.",
      "He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.",
      "Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.",
      "Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.",
      "Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.",
      "Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.",
      "\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.",
      "In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.",
      "He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.",
      "\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.",
      "\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"",
      "He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.",
      "\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.",
      "\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"",
      "The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.",
      "One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.",

      "\"The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",

      "The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK.",
      "\"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said.",

      "Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged.",
      "However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\".",
      "Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise.",
      "1. April's bills and costs",
      "A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises.",
      "They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence.",
      "For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices.",
      "Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%).",
      "After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next.",
      "2. The Donald Trump tariffs effect",
      "The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks.",
      "The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.",
      "Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate.",
      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",
      "But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.",
      "Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war.",
      "So, any price rises would be limited.",
      "China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK.",
      "A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation.",
      "3. Performance of the UK economy",
      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",
      "No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed.",
      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",
      "So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.",

      "While both Washington and Beijing have said they are open to negotiating, neither have made a move to do so yet.",
      "When that happens, Li, 58, will play a key role. He previously served as a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and has held several key jobs in the commerce ministry.",
      "Speaking to Reuters, one expert said the change in jobs was \"very abrupt and potentially disruptive\" given the current trade tensions - adding that Wang also had experience negotiating with US since the first Trump administration.",
      "\"It might be that in the view of China's top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse... and finally start negotiating,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the Conference Board's China Centre.",
      "However, another analyst who spoke to Reuters suggested the move could just be a \"routine promotion\" that just happened to come at a particularly tense period in time.",
      "The US should 'stop whining'",
      "Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Sheng Laiyun, deputy commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) warned that US levies would put pressure on China's foreign trade and economy, but added that China's economy is resilient and should improve in the long term.",
      "\"We firmly oppose the US practice of tariff barriers and trade bullying,\" said Sheng.",
      "\"It violates the economic laws and the principles of the World Trade Organization, has a serious impact on the world economic order, and drags down the recovery of the world economy.\"",
      "In an editorial by state news outlet China Daily earlier this week, the outlet described the US's behaviour as \"capricious and destructive\", adding that it should \"stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade\".",
      "\"The US is not getting ripped off by anybody...rather... [it] has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train,\" the editorial went on to say.",
      "Promising growth - but will it last?",
      "Beijing's GDP figures for the first quarter have beaten analysts' expectations - which hovered around 5.1%.",
      "Growth in the world's second-largest economy was underscored by strong retail sales and promising factory output.",
      "But US tariffs on China soared only in recent weeks. Trump raised them to 145% early last week, and Beijing retaliated by raising levies on US goods to 125%.",
      "So some of the expansion could be down to factories rushing out shipments to beat Trump's tariffs - a concept called \"front loading\".",
      "Analysts say a surge in China's exports in March will be sharply reversed in the months ahead as tariffs take full effect.",
      "China's property downturn is also still dragging on growth. Property investment fell by almost 10% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "New home prices also were unchanged compared to the previous month - a sign that there are still too many empty homes, and not enough people buying them.",
      "Officials have said there is ample room for stimulus measures, and plenty of tools that they can use to bolster the economy and roll out more support measures.",
      "But it will be especially important for China to boost domestic demand and spending this year as Washington's tariffs hits Beijing's crucial export sector."

      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",

      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",

      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

    "summary": "America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023.",
      "However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%.",

      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",

      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",

      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",

      "Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.",
      "\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"",
      "There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.",
      "\"We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!\" laughs Ms Runeberg.",
      "While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.",
      "It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than \u20ac6m ($6.7m; \u00a35.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.",

      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",

      "Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.",
      "\"You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,\" says Ms Ilmari.",
      "But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.",

      "\"We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.\"",

      "A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.",
      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",
      "Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.",

    "summary": "A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",

      "Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected.",
      "But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession.",
      "That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.",
      "Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs.",

      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",

      "Falling petrol prices drove UK inflation down by more than expected in the year to March.",
      "Inflation was 2.6%, down from a rate of 2.8% in February, according to official data.",
      "But the fall may only be temporary as analysts say it's expected to spike from April as rising bills and higher business costs take hold.",
      "\"The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",
      "The average rise in wages was 5.9%, data released by the ONS on Tuesday showed.",
      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics.",
      "The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK.",
      "\"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said.",
      "\"Perhaps not as high as the Bank of England had feared a few months ago, but the economy will be weaker, with exports and investment and consumer spending all hit and unemployment starting to rise\".",
      "He added that another side-effect of Trump's trade war is hitting global growth, which causes oil prices to fall, which will feed through to lower petrol prices here in the UK.",
      "'It's getting higher and higher'",
      "Sonja Skelton says the biggest cost for her business is staffing - and that's about to get higher with minimum wage increases.",
      "The recent increase in National Insurance has cost her over \u00a360,000.",
      "\"And it's getting higher and higher,\" she says, but she adds she's happy to pay as she says it will help to improve the UK's infrastructure.",
      "Her firm, West Special Fasteners, makes nuts and bolts, and has been doing since 1999.",
      "The firm has over 65 employees and supplies offshore defence and specialist construction firms with non-standard fasteners, made with stainless steel and exotic metals.",
      "\"We're trying to be a little bit more efficient, so we're trying to improve all our processes, because that can help claw some of that money back.\"",
      "But, she adds, if she isn't able to absorb extra costs, the prices of her products will have to go up.",
      "\"So there's a specialist material we call that's called Hastelloy C-276. I'd probably say around five years ago, that might have been, say, \u00a330 per kilo.",

      "Interest rate cut",
      "As inflation comes down, it could put pressure on the Bank of England to cut its key interest rate, currently 4.5%.",
      "Vacancies at their lowest point in four years and economic pressure predicted from Donald Trump's tariffs may also encourage the Bank to cut when it meets next month.",
      "But the Bank faces a dilemma, as wage growth remains strong and this would normally discourage a cut in rates.",
      "Experts and analysts predict inflation to fall to near its 2% target by 2026.",

      "It was a bigger drop than analysts had expected, which the ONS said was driven by a fall in petrol prices.",
      "Why are prices still rising?",
      "Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.",
      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",
      "Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.",
      "Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?",
      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",
      "For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.",
      "Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.",
      "What is happening to UK interest rates?",
      "The Bank of England cut rates to 5% in August 2024, to 4.75% in November and again to 4.5% in February.",
      "It then held rates in March. Announcing that decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned about global economic uncertainty but said that he still believed interest rates were on a \"gradually declining path\".",
      "The Bank expects inflation to spike at 3.7% between July and September 2025 due to higher energy prices, water bills and bus fares.",
      "It then thinks inflation will drop back towards the 2% target towards the end of 2027, having previously predicted this would happen earlier in the year.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",
      "Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends.",
      "This was 3.4% in January, down slightly from 3.5% in February.",
      "When rates were held at 4.5% in March, the Bank was concerned about the possible impacts of increases to the amount of National Insurance paid by employers and the minimum wage, both of which took effect at the start of April.",

      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "The pair had been accused of breaking the university's student code of conduct by disrupting a business meeting and \"behaving in an intimidating and disorderly manner\" towards staff on 22 May.",
      "The University of Birmingham said it had a \"strong and longstanding commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom\" backed by its code of conduct.",

      "At the time, protesters claimed they were peacefully trying to encourage the university to financially divest from companies linked to Israel.",
      "However, staff members inside the meeting reported that it was a \"frightening\" experience for them.",
      "One witness statement heard by the disciplinary panel read: \"The whole incident did not feel peaceful, it felt deliberately disruptive.\"",

      "A petition supporting them attracted more than 2,000 signatures and was endorsed  by several key figures, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.",
      "They had also enlisted the help of the European Legal Support Centre, which put forward legal submissions to the misconduct panel and argued that the university had a legal duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "Less than a month before the hearing, Ms Listrat was elected as the incoming Guild of Students President and she said she was worried she might lose her position.",

      "The Firework singer was one of six women on Monday's 11-minute space flight, organised by billionaire Amazon owner Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin.",
      "Inspired by a listener texting in, Greg floated the idea of a UK equivalent called Air Force Hun with British billionaire Sir Richard, using his company Virgin Galactic.",

      "Speaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person.",
      "\"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\"",
      "Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.",

      "The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.",
      "Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.",
      "But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"",
      "She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.",
      "2. Daniel Day-Lewis",
      "The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.",
      "Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.",
      "Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.",
      "He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.",
      "A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".",
      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men and Batman.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",
      "That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.",
      "The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.",
      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",

      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "8. Bridget Fonda",
      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",

    "story": [
      "The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication.",
      "The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings.",
      "In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue.",
      "Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years.",
      "The 'whole field of womanly action'",
      "The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life.",
      "Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\".",
      "The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden.",
      "The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels.",
      "\"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted.",
      "Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\".",
      "Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.",
      "'How to sack a servant'",
      "Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes.",
      "In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\".",
      "Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\"",
      "And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.",
      "Rebranding The Lady",
      "That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78.",
      "A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines.",
      "Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.",
      "Custard creams in the safe",
      "And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture.",
      "The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat.",
      "He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest.",
      "The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character.",
      "No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea.",
      "Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels.",
      "The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.",
      "The L word",
      "However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away.",
      "Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging.",
      "And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine.",
      "However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on."

    "story": [
      "The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres last year was down by almost a third compared with 10 years earlier, BBC research suggests.",
      "In 2024, the 40 best-funded theatre companies that make their own productions - ranging from the National Theatre to the Colchester Mercury - opened 229 original productions, compared with 332 in 2014, a drop of 31%.",
      "Funding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at \"breaking point\".",
      "But some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.",
      "Last week, actress Lesley Manville warned that new talent had \"less opportunity\" to develop than when she was starting out in the 1970s.",
      "\"It's going to be a diminishing discipline, because there's not always the amount of stage work available for them to go and do,\" she told BBC Radio 4 after winning an Olivier Award.",
      "'Serious problem'",
      "Leeds Playhouse chief executive and artistic director James Brining said the venue had cut its number of homegrown shows from 12 to eight a year.",
      "\"That decision to contract has been forced upon theatres because it's so expensive, and increasingly so, to make work,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We love making work. So it's heartbreaking that the amount of work you can make is reducing, and it is reducing the pipeline opportunities for artists at the beginning of their careers.\"",
      "British theatre has \"a serious problem\" with the reduction in opportunities, added Brining, who is about to move from Leeds to run the Edinburgh Lyceum.",
      "25 of the best theatre shows to see in spring/summer 2025",
      "25 of the best theatre shows to see in spring/summer 2025",
      "Many performers and crew start their careers in theatres before going on to work in TV and film, arts education consultant and theatre blogger Carl Woodward said.",
      "\"A lot of Netflix stars and a lot of those people we see on dramas like Mr Bates vs the Post office and Adolescence cut their teeth in regional theatres.",
      "\"And if those opportunities are no longer there, then those pathways don't exist. And that is a national scandal, I think.\"",
      "The theatre industry's financial pressures have had an impact on the workforce, with \"chronic low pay, job insecurity, poor work/life balance,\" he added.",
      "Many venues said they now co-produce more shows with other theatres or commercial operators to spread the costs and risks. That also means those productions can be on a bigger scale.",
      "\"Some individual productions that are made with the commercial sector are much bigger than anything we ever used to make,\" Birmingham Rep chief executive Rachael Thomas said.",
      "\"So for us, yes there are fewer productions coming out, but we are spending more because the productions that we are making are so much bigger than they ever used to be.\"",
      "However, the Rep has lost all of its annual local council funding - once worth more than \u00a31m a year - and smaller shows have often been squeezed out, Thomas said.",
      "\"I suppose the subsidy enables you to take the risk on the productions that are never going to recoup what they've cost, and often that will be the smaller-scale productions.\"",
      "In 1995, the Rep's studio theatre staged the premiere of East Is East, four years before it became a hit British film. It couldn't afford to do a play of that scale in its studio today.",
      "\"I cannot see a world in which we could now launch a play which has got a cast size of nine or 10 in our 133-seater studio space now as a new play,\" Thomas said.",
      "\"For our model, and I would say for the vast majority of regional producing theatres, that is nigh on impossible.\"",
      "'Less serious drama'",
      "Salisbury Playhouse artistic director Gareth Machin said audience tastes had also changed, meaning it's harder to put on \"serious drama\", especially outside London.",
      "\"When money is tight, people want a good night out and they don't want to take a risk,\" he said.",
      "\"They're probably not coming out as much as they were, so when they do come out they don't want to take a chance on something they're not sure is going to be entertaining and a fun experience.",
      "\"So there's less misery and risk.\"",
      "Nottingham Playhouse chief executive and UK Theatre joint president Stephanie Sirr said she didn't recognise the picture of a drop in productions, pointing out that \"it does fluctuate from year to year\".",
      "\"I do think it's more difficult to produce these days,\" she continued.",
      "\"The costs have gone up exponentially. Things like the energy costs really impact you if you're building scenery all day, or if you're running theatre lanterns all night.\"",
      "However, making more co-productions is a positive thing in most ways, and has meant \"we've been able to really increase the scale of the work we produce\", she said, with Nottingham's production of Dear Evan Hansen now on a major UK tour.",
      "'More with less'",
      "A handful of venues staged more original shows in 2024 than 2014. They include Leicester Curve, which has put a focus on making musicals in collaboration with commercial producers, which can then go on the road.",
      "Curve has doubled its box office receipts over the past decade.",
      "\"By sharing resources and risk, we're able to, by default, do more work and create and present more work,\" chief executive Chris Stafford said.",
      "\"We are doing more with less in terms of public investment,\" he continued, but said the biggest challenge for many theatres would be affording essential building repairs and upgrades in the coming years.",
      "Annual funding from Arts Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish equivalent has largely been stagnant for the past 10 years - while inflation has risen sharply - and many venues have had their local council subsidies cut. Many are also still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.",
      "Last year, a survey by the group Freelancers Make Theatre Work depicted \"a workforce that is at breaking point\".",
      "Performer and group spokesman Paul Carey Jones said the BBC research \"would come as no surprise to most theatre freelancers in the UK, who have been struggling with low rates of pay, career precarity and vulnerability, a lack of job certainty and a skills retention crisis for many years now.",
      "\"It shows the need for action from government in terms of funding for the arts, but also from the theatre industry to support its freelance workforce, on which it entirely depends.\"",
      "The research for this story counted original and co-productions that opened in 2014 and 2024, including revivals, transfers and tours. They had to be professional in-person theatre productions, at least an hour long, and to have run for at least a week. If a co-production was jointly made by more than one theatre, it was counted as a single production.",
      "The research covered the 40 venues, festivals and touring companies that produce original theatre, were operating in 2014 and 2024, and had the highest annual grants in 2024/25 from the Arts Councils of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Creative Scotland and the Scottish government.",

      "\"I saw this woman coming out of a motorhome near the place where the stars are on the pavement,\" says Collins. \"She was dressed as Marilyn Monroe, in a white halterneck dress, and she popped some money in the parking meter.",
      "\"It was the strangest image. I never saw her again but I never forgot her.\"",
      "Collins, who is best known for her portrayal of Cindy Beale in Eastenders, began turning that one moment into a play about an aspiring actress with an obsessive interest in Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe.",

      "He first visited Edinburgh in 2007 on a British Council tour, when he was running the South African National Arts Festival.",
      "\"It became evident to me that this was the gold standard for festivals wherever you are in the world, even on the tip of Africa,\" he says.",
      "Back then, his was one of seven fringe festivals which had begun working together to further their common aims. Today, more than 300 festivals from around the world are linked in a new network, and he says the advice they share is vital.",
      "\"It can be a lonely job running a festival,\" he adds. \"Just the comfort of knowing that on your phone is a person who is going through the same thing.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans \u2013 but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs.",
      "\"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah.",
      "\"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him and lay at his feet.\"",
      "It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse.",
      "\"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\"",
      "Hannah, known for appearing in films such as Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream \u2013 and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
      "Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow.",
      "\"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls.",
      "\"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this\u2026 We'll see'.\"",
      "\"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\"",
      "Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning.",
      "It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches.",
      "\"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah.",
      "\"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage.",
      "\"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\"",
      "Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life.",
      "More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage.",
      "Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden.",
      "Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park.",
      "The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.)",
      "It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy.",
      "Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\".",
      "Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start.",
      "\"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience.",
      "\"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\".",
      "Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong.",
      "\"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues.",
      "\"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness.",
      "\"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\"",
      "Barred from America?",
      "Young recently made headlines for pulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\".",
      "He later backtracked, saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions).",
      "But his European tour isn't without peril. Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country.",
      "\"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote.",
      "Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" and suing him for using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail.",
      "Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen.",
      "\"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\"",
      "Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country.",
      "\"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas \u2013 which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\"",
      "Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails).",
      "The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again?",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me.",

      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" he said.",
      "Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - essentially rewrote the rules of hip-hop in the 1990s, but his career has been punctuated by controversies.",
      "Here is a timeline of his career and the accusations against him.",
      "1969-89: Early life in New York",
      "Sean John Combs was born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "His mother, Janice, was a teacher's assistant, while his father Melvin was a former member of the US Air Force who became an associate of the drug-trafficker Frank Lucas, who later inspired the Ridley Scott film American Gangster.",
      "In 1972, Melvin was fatally shot in his car during a drug transaction after being misidentified as an informant. Combs was just two, although he didn't learn the circumstances of his father's death until much later.",
      "Raised by his mother, he was a flashy kid who loved rap music and played football for the school team.",
      "As a teenager, he danced in music videos for artists such as Diana Ross and the Fine Young Cannibals.",
      "Taking a cue from his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support Sean and his sister Keisha, he also worked six separate newspaper delivery routes, before enrolling to study business administration at Howard University.",
      "Early 1990s: Party plans turn into tragedy",
      "At university, Mr Combs gained a reputation for throwing lavish parties, some of which attracted more than a thousand guests.",
      "After booking musicians such as Heavy D and Terry Riley to play at these gigs, he came to the attention of Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, who gave him an internship in New York.",
      "Mr Combs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.",
      "However, tragedy struck in 1991, when Mr Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.",
      "An inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Mr Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.",
      "\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"",
      "No criminal charges were filed over the tragedy, but family members of the people who died sued the promoters, the college and the city, accusing them of negligence.",
      "The case was settled for $3.8m (\u00a33m), of which Mr Combs paid $750,000.",
      "Mid-to-late 1990s: A new beginning",
      "Mr Combs struck upon the idea of pairing R&B singers like Mary J Blige with the street-tough sounds of hip-hop",
      "While at Uptown, Mr Combs signed a young Brooklyn rapper called Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G. - and started work on his debut album.",
      "But his relationship with Harrell broke down and Mr Combs was fired. He retaliated by setting up his own label, Bad Boy Records, and taking Biggie with him.",
      "The star's debut album, Ready To Die, was hailed as an all-time rap classic, selling millions of copies and generating the multi-platinum singles Juicy and Big Poppa.",
      "Mr Combs quickly expanded the Bad Boy roster, releasing hit albums by Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112 and Total.",
      "The label's sound was slick and polished. Its biggest singles lifted chunky samples from well-known hits. The practice was frowned upon by hip-hop purists, but it was catnip to radio programmers.",

      "The murder has never been solved, but it has consistently been linked to the East-Coast-West-Coast rivalry that consumed rap music in the 1990s and which had previously claimed the life of Tupac Shakur.",
      "Mr Combs, who had been travelling in the car behind his friend, poured his grief into a song, I'll Be Missing You, which became one of the biggest songs of 1997.",

      "1999: New York shooting",
      "By this stage, Bad Boy had become one of the most important labels in rap. Aside from its own releases, artists including Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez were asking Mr Combs to remix their songs, hoping for a dash of hip-hop credibility.",
      "But there was trouble, too. In May 1999, Mr Combs was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Interscope Records executive Steve Stoute, after a disagreement over a music video. He pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to a one-day anger management class, external.",
      "Later that year, he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon when police found two nine-millimetre guns in his car, after an argument in a club turned violent.",

      "Her self-titled debut was released in 2008 and its futuristic, space-age R&B proved to be a hit with critics.",
      "By that stage, Mr Combs and Ventura were in a relationship. But in a civil lawsuit filed in December 2023, she said the mogul had used his position of power to \"set the groundwork\" for a \"manipulative and coercive romantic and sexual relationship\".",
      "Her lawsuit included multiple graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "Ventura also alleged sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by Mr Combs' \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",
      "Mr Combs strenuously denied the allegations and accused Ventura of trying to extort him. They settled the case a day after it was filed in New York, with Mr Combs' lawyer saying the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing\".",
      "2007-2024: Business ventures",
      "Music took a back seat after 2007, when Mr Combs signed a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc, in the US for a 50-50 profit split.",
      "His endorsement saw the brand placed in dozens of music videos - including Diddy's own single \"Ciroc Star\" - and helped increase sales from 40,000 to 2,000,000 cases per year by 2014.",
      "Around the same time, he co-founded the media company Revolt, whose TV channels and websites are described as \"the unapologetic, authoritative voice of hip-hop culture\".",
      "Mr Combs' involvement with both companies came to an end in 2023-24. He had previously sued Diageo, accusing it of neglecting his brand because of race.",

      "As the row escalated, Mr Combs allegedly threatened an intern with a kettle bell. He was later arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon.",

      "In a complaint filed in Manhattan, Joi Dickerson-Neal accused the star of drugging and sexually assaulting her when she was a college student in 1991. She also claimed he recorded the attack and distributed the footage without her consent.",
      "A third woman, Liza Gardner, also filed court papers accusing Mr Combs of coercing her into sex in the early 1990s and then, a couple of days later, choking her so hard that she passed out.",
      "The lawsuits all came shortly before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily allowed people who said they were sexually abused to file claims, even after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "Mr Combs denied all the allegations against him, while his spokesperson called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".",
      "\"The claims involving alleged misconduct against Mr Combs from over 30 years ago and filed at the last minute are all completely denied and rejected by him,\" they said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week.",
      "Set to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre (1.9-sq-km) site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings.",
      "But from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task.",
      "To find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some rollercoaster experts.",
      "Building an iconic rollercoaster",
      "Of course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order.",
      "While \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.",
      "\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.",
      "A good example, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.",
      "\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.",
      "How Universal Studios almost came to Essex",
      "Bond and Paddington could star at Universal park",
      "If the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.",
      "During the brainstorming stage of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world\", says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.",
      "While an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element... must serve the wider guest story\".",
      "Dennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.",
      "He adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.",
      "Usually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".",
      "Mr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph (240 km/h) around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph (110-145 km/h) on their first drop.",
      "Once the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.",
      "\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer.\"",
      "Your route to the ride is key",
      "When you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.",
      "During the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.",
      "The \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"",
      "Discussions about potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities all fit into the space. It often determines how long people will end up queuing for.",
      "An artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.",
      "Alton Towers has a lake too. Theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around it (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler). She heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds.",
      "At the back of parks designed in this way you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction\", says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs.",
      "\"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\"",
      "Another tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Mr Sinclair-Harris.",
      "\"In a sense you've got that central gathering point... like the castle in the Magic Kingdom... with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\"",
      "Universal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals.",
      "The finer details",
      "So the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself.",
      "Then come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there.",
      "Trees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\".",
      "Even the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright.",
      "As Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park.",
      "The sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

      "\"All those things add up over time and generate a sense of injustice,\" Mager says, adding that artist Christine Sun Kim describes this feeling as \"deaf rage\".",
      "It is a feeling partly borne out of the frustration and isolation of living in a hearing-centred world.",
      "This rage, alongside a love of 70s thrillers, is what inspired Mager's new drama.",

      "Mager, a lifelong fan of 70s thrillers, says he wanted to put his own \"twist\" on films like Get Carter and The Outfit (which feature \"intimidating men in cool clothes\" on a mission of vengeance) by drawing on the deaf experience as well.",
      "\"Reunion starts out like those classic thrillers, but ends up in a very different place,\" the writer says.",
      "As main character Brennan hunts down a man known only as Monroe, viewers become aware of a painful secret he's been hiding and the struggles he is facing to find justice in a hearing-centred world.",

      "One key example is a scene where Brennan's daughter Carly has to pass on painful information to her mother and father that would usually be relayed by professionals, due to a lack of interpreters.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that's still the reality today,\" Mager says, explaining his wife recently experienced this, having to interpret for her mother at a hospital appointment, because an interpreter had not been booked.",

      "Another thing Mager wanted to draw attention to was literacy rates in deaf children.",
      "A key plot point in Reunion is that Brennan is unable to read or write in English which, coupled with the prison's failure to book interpreters, means he misses important letters from his daughter and does not have his case details fully explained.",
      "\"Deaf children often lag behind their hearing counterparts in education, particularly [in] reading and writing,\" Mager says.",

    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

      "Sir Keir told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Firstly, a woman is an adult female, so let's clear that one up.\"",
      "Often sounding completely exasperated by the question, the Labour leader said in one interview that \"almost nobody is talking about trans issues\", querying why it had become a focus of fierce debate.",

      "By the time of last year's general election, Sunak said voters faced a \"crystal-clear choice\" about the protection of single-sex spaces, promising to rewrite the Equality Act to make clear that sex as a protected characteristic means biological sex.",
      "Today's Supreme Court ruling has been welcomed by the Conservatives, with leader Kemi Badenoch calling it a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "As Sunak's women and equalities minister, Badenoch led the UK government's efforts to block Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",

      "And in a sign that the Tories might finally be ready to give up one of their most cherished attack lines, Badenoch declared on social media: \"The era of Keir Starmer telling us that some women have penises has come to an end. Hallelujah!\"",

      "When asked by presenter Nick Ferrari \"so, a woman can have a penis?\", he replied: \"Well, quite clearly.\"",
      "He went on to suggest that trans people's rights were adequately protected by the Equality Act, which \"allow there to be single sex spaces\".",

      "On paper, the Green Party of England and Wales is equally clear, at the opposite end of the spectrum.",

    "story": [
      "Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
      "The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.",
      "Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling",
      "Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?",
      "The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.",
      "The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.",
      "Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation.",
      "He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.",
      "\"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\"",
      "He added that the legislation gives transgender people \"protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender\".",
      "Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.",
      "The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including \"sex\" and \"gender reassignment\".",
      "Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by \"sex\" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.",
      "The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex \"for all purposes\".",
      "For Women Scotland argued for a \"common sense\" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\".",
      "Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: \"Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.",
      "\"Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.",
      "He posted on social media: \"The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.",
      "\"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.\"",
      "Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",
      "The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "PM: I'll only sign US tariffs deal if it suits UK",
      "UK government sources have suggested that recent talks with the US on a trade deal have been making good progress. It is understood that any deal would focus on more than just lowering tariffs, and cover elements of trade in both goods and services.",
      "In Vance's wide-ranging interview with UnHerd, he suggested a US-UK trade deal would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "He mentioned Germany as an example of a country that exported heavily to the US but by comparison was \"pretty tough on a lot of American\" exports.",
      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said that the UK was in a \"good position\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast that talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US. We think that would be the best way to secure jobs and growth in our country,\" she added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally\".",
      "\"It seems to me that President Trump is bypassing Congress. We don't want to copy that,\" he told the BBC's World at One programme.",
      "Any trade deal with the US should be \"properly examined\" by ministers, he added.",
      "After Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, stock markets across the globe took a tumble, with trillions of dollars wiped from the US Stock market in the days after.",
      "The president has since made some exemptions, and stock markets on Monday showed signs of recovery, although they are still down on the month.",
      "Vance said any implementation of a new system is going to make financial markets \"jittery\" and that Trump is committed to the tariff strategy as \"a long-term play\".",
      "\"What we want is to see lower trade deficits, really across the board,\" Vance said.",
      "The vice-president also expressed an affinity for Europe, after disparaging remarks between him and other top US officials were leaked from a private chat.",
      "\"I love European people. I've said repeatedly that I think that you can't separate American culture from European culture,\" Vance said.",
      "He also emphasised points that he and the White House have made repeatedly, saying that Europe needs to better fortify its own self defence.",
      "\"It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance went on to address the war in Ukraine and criticism that the US might be getting too cosy with Russia President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He reiterated the administration's messaging that to end the war \"you have to try to understand\" both sides.",
      "\"That doesn't mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion,\" Vance said.",
      "\"But you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,\" he continued.",
      "On Sunday, Russia launched its deadliest attacks on Ukraine this year, killing at least 35 people and prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to invite Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia."

      "Striking workers held a rally on Tuesday morning, a day after Unite union members rejected the city council's latest pay offer.",
      "\"We're already back to collecting normal household waste this week,\" Mr Cooper said. \"We are back into a position of good control.",
      "\"The priority now is street cleansing and making sure the fly-tipping is at a manageable level.\"",
      "He added that the council had 120 bin lorries out every day completing rounds, which was roughly half of its total capacity.",
      "Garden waste and recycling will not be collected by the authority until the strike is over, he said.",
      "Mr Cooper described it as \"disappointing\" that an agreement had not been reached with Unite and urged them to \"come back to the table\" to end the dispute.",
      "More negotiations between the two sides are expected to take place on Wednesday.",
      "Why are Birmingham bin workers on strike?",
      "The dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles from some bin workers.",
      "On Monday, workers voted to reject the council's latest offer, which Unite said was \"totally inadequate\" and also did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers.",
      "A council spokesperson said the offer was fair and included options for affected workers.",
      "But one of them, Jordan McNeill, a mother-of-two who came to Tuesday's rally, said workers were already on a low wage.",

      "Unite said a petition supporting the striking workers and containing 3,000 signatures was handed in during the event.",
      "Many Brummies have stepped forward to help each other out during the strikes, with neighbours sharing trips to the tip and volunteer litter-pickers seeing their work increase.",

      "\"That's just being a good citizen, a good member of the community.\"",
      "During the strike, the council has been running mobile collections where bin trucks park at a fixed location in a neighbourhood for a morning, so people can bring along their rubbish.",
      "Mr Hassan told BBC Radio WM that the bin strike had been \"very, very tough\" for residents, especially with the weather getting warmer in recent weeks.",
      "He said he was hopeful the two sides would soon find a solution, as \"this sort of stuff can't go on forever\".",
      "Violet Williams, a Small Heath resident who was using the waste centre, said she felt \"awful\" when she saw photos of bin bags piling up on the city's streets, which have made headlines around the world.",
      "Ms Williams, who does not have a car, was dropping her rubbish off at the centre before taking a bus to collect more rubbish from her 92-year-old mother.",
      "Bin workers at the rally stressed that they were not on strike in order to get a pay rise but in order to protect their existing roles and wages.",
      "One of them, Maxine Stanley, said: \"Once they say our wages [will be] left alone, we'll all go back to work. We're all Birmingham residents \u2013 my bins haven't been collected.",
      "\"But at the end of the day, we've got to stand firm against Birmingham City Council.",
      "\"I don't want Birmingham to look like this, I want it to be clean.\"",
      "\"Not one of the people you see standing here wants to be on strike,\" said Samuel Yates, who holds one of the WRCO roles that is at the centre of the dispute.",
      "\"We don't want a wage rise; we just want a fair pay for the fair day's work that we do.\"",
      "Mr Yates said he stood to lose \u00a36,200 per year from his salary on top of a \u00a31,200 wage cut that he had already had to accept.",
      "Many workers also said they did not like to see the city's streets in a poor state, but they felt they had to go on strike to protect their livelihoods.",
      "\"The majority of us don't just work in Birmingham; we actually live in Birmingham too, so we are Birmingham residents, and we're affected as much as the public are,\" said Steeven Biset.",

    "story": [
      "The UK Supreme Court has unanimously and unambiguously backed the argument that the definition of a woman in the Equality Act should be based on biological sex.",
      "Reading out the ruling, Lord Hodge cautioned that it should not be taken as a triumph for one group in society over another.",
      "But there were scenes of jubilation for women's campaigners outside the Supreme Court.",
      "Tearful hugs were exchanged and a bottle of champagne was cracked open.",
      "The fact someone had thought to bring one along underlines that it was potentially on the cards, but For Women Scotland (FWS) still seemed shocked by the scale of their victory.",
      "The Scottish government's argument - that sex can be changed via the gender recognition process, and that someone with a gender recognition certificate should have the protections of that sex - were dismissed.",
      "So what does it all mean?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "UK Supreme Court rules legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex",
      "The application of the law on the ground, in \"real life\", was clearly foremost in the minds of the judges.",
      "Take the example of single sex spaces and services - part of the motivation for FWS bringing this case.",
      "The previous reading of the law was that everything from hospital wards and prison wings to support groups for victims of abuse can exclude everyone but women thanks to exceptions in the Equality Act.",
      "The concern from campaigners was that if people could change their sex with a certificate, and then claim protection against discrimination as a woman, that could be more complicated.",
      "That's particularly the case on a practical level, given those providing these services aren't actually meant to ask to see a gender recognition certificate.",
      "Now, the court is clear that this exemption can continue - the rules underpinning women-only spaces can exclude people with gender recognition certificates, along with everyone else.",
      "Does the Equality Act still protect trans people?",
      "There are still conditions which need to be satisfied - services will have to show that excluding trans people is a limited and proportionate means to achieving a legitimate aim.",
      "Blanket bans are generally discouraged. There is still a bar to clear to exclude anyone, and the test of proportionality has to be met in each case.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers",
      "But FWS are clearly delighted with the underlying principle, and hope it will lead to clearer guidance for those providing services.",
      "It's important to note that trans people are still protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed that there are other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.",
      "He was clear that trans people are a \"vulnerable and often harassed minority\", who \"struggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignity\".",
      "But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a certificate.",
      "Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers can't ask to see the certificate.",
      "They say the law needs to be \"clear and consistent\" - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be \"incoherent\".",
      "The court carefully weighs the letter of the law, but it's worth remembering that ultimately that law is drafted by politicians - and it can be changed at the stroke of a pen.",
      "Will gender reform be relaunched at Holyrood?",
      "The issue may now move out of the legal arena and back into the political one.",
      "There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the definitions of the Equality Act, which is Westminster legislation.",
      "The court has handily done that for them, and UK ministers have welcomed the ruling.",
      "There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case.",
      "For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they can't comment on live litigation.",
      "They will have to go into a little more detail now, but I imagine this is issue still just about the last thing they want to talk about.",
      "There had been some speculation that a ruling like this could raise the prospect of ministers re-launching their attempts at gender reform at Holyrood.",
      "But frankly there is not the political will in the John Swinney administration to ride into battle on this issue, as there was under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "With a Holyrood election looming, there is no prospect of the first minister deciding to wade back into such a contentious debate.",
      "But with For Women Scotland now hoping to use this ruling to hold his feet to fire when it comes to broader government policies and guidance, it is one he will need to address."

    "story": [
      "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",
      "The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\".",
      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",
      "This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods.",
      "In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged.",
      "Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit.",
      "This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs.",
      "The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act.",
      "However, there is a big problem now.",
      "The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",

      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",

      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two and a half times the size of Earth and is seven hundred trillion miles away from us.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he told me.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on k2-18b it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy\".",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, 99.7%. Which sounds a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. But it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with; they are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below . But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet,\" he said.",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, which highlights the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.",
      "Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.",
      "In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.",
      "While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".",
      "\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.",
      "He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.",
      "Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.",
      "Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.",
      "Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.",
      "\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.",
      "The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.",
      "\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"",
      "Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.",
      "\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"",
      "The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.",
      "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.",
      "Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.",
      "\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"",
      "The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.",
      "When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.",
      "'Deliberate fire setting is a crime'",
      "Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.",
      "But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year.",
      "From 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.",
      "In north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.",
      "Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.",
      "Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.",
      "In south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.",
      "At Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.",
      "Station manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand.",
      "\"We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,\" he said.",
      "\"We accept that some fires can be accidental, but deliberate fire setting is a crime and that's the message we'd like to get out.\"",

      "Pop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket.",
      "The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\".",
      "After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\".",
      "The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.",
      "Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).",
      "The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas.",
      "Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them.",
      "Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark.",
      "\"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\"",
      "She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\"",
      "\"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\"",
      "Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.",
      "Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground.",
      "\"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said.",
      "The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\"",
      "A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground.",
      "Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\"",
      "\"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added.",
      "Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.",
      "\"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said.",
      "The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.",
      "The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6.",
      "Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions.",
      "The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.",
      "But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.",
      "\"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.",
      "\"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.",
      "\"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\"",
      "The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.",
      "Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\"",
      "But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\"",
      "Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\"",
      "However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\"",
      "\"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said.",
      "In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.",
      "\"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King.",
      "She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.",
      "Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions.",
      "Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.",
      "Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.",
      "Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems.",
      "The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.",
      "According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.",
      "Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.",
      "Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.",
      "The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.",
      "Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible.",
      "Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.",
      "Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer.",
      "On its web page under the title \"Protecting our Planet\" Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\"",
      "However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality\u00a0at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere.",
      "\"It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,\" she says.",

      "Flights were grounded for eight days in mid-April 2010 with a major impact on passengers in the UK and around the world",
      "'Black Swan Event'",
      "The day after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace.",
      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",
      "This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue.",
      "According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\"",

      "\"An eye opener globally\"",
      "The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland.",
      "Once Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since.",
      "He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\"",
      "Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia.",
      "As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way.",
      "Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines.",
      "Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe.",
      "Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\"",
      "On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration.",
      "Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal.",
      "Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures.",
      "Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010",
      "Have things changed?",
      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, manager for clean industry & transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is heading to the US to meet Donald Trump \u2013 a visit that will see her walk a tightrope between representing the interests of the EU and remaining in the US president's good books.",
      "As the first European leader to travel to Washington since Trump introduced - then paused \u2013 20% tariffs on the EU earlier in April, Meloni will be hoping to convince him of the merits of a \"zero-for-zero\" tariffs deal for the entire EU.",
      "Italy is particularly vulnerable to any changes to US trade policy.",
      "Around 10% of its exports - worth about \u20ac67bn (\u00a357bn; $76bn) - go to the US, Italy's third biggest non-EU trading partner, and the tariffs announced by Trump earlier this month caused Rome to halve its growth forecast.",
      "\"We know this is a difficult time,\" Meloni said ahead of her trip. \"We will do our best \u2013 I am aware of what I represent and of what I am defending.\"",
      "At this fraught moment, she is perhaps one of the best-placed current European leaders to speak to Trump. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen recognises that and they have been speaking regularly ahead of the trip.",
      "Trump and Meloni famously enjoy a good relationship and have lavished praise on one another in the past. He has called her a \"fantastic woman\" who has \"really taken Europe by storm\".",
      "For her part, Meloni \u2013 who has headed a right-wing coalition government since 2022 - is ideologically closer to Trump than to some of her European neighbours.",
      "In a video message to a US conservative conference in February, she echoed some of Trump's common talking points, railing against mass migration, \"globalist elites\" and \"woke ideology\".",
      "She was also the only European leader to attend the US president's inauguration in January, and has steered clear of overtly criticising the work of his administration since.",
      "The harshest criticism she has dispensed was earlier this month, when she said Trump's decision to impose 20% tariffs on the EU was \"absolutely wrong\" and that it would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".",
      "\"Meloni has always said that Europe shouldn't take any decisions that put it on a collision course with the US, and that Europe should adapt rather than resist,\" said Riccardo Alcaro of the Italian Institute for International Affairs in Rome.",
      "\"If the Trump administration is immovable on tariffs, she'll agree to counter-tariffs. But her first move is always to say no. Because ultimately she thinks the importance of the West in the world is thanks to the US, and that the West revolves around the US.\"",
      "Meloni's world view is also closer to that of many of Trump's main allies than many of her European neighbours.",
      "\"She knows that Italy is strategically, politically and economically subordinate to the EU \u2013 but she also has a genuine proximity to MAGA Republicans,\" Alcaro added.",
      "US Vice-President JD Vance is due to travel to Rome on Friday for Easter, and will see Meloni as well as leading officials at the Vatican.",
      "Meloni's natural affinity to an administration many in Europe are having trouble finding common ground with has sparked concern among some Europeans that, in the privacy of the Oval Office, she may be tempted to go at it alone and argue for more favourable terms for Italy.",
      "Last week France's Industry Minister Marc Ferracci spoke out against \"bilateral talks\" and warned Trump's strategy was to \"divide Europeans\".",
      "His comments irritated Rome and had to be toned down later by a French government spokesperson.",
      "US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "The European Commission has signalled it has confidence in Meloni, and a spokeswoman said \"any outreach to the US [was] very welcome\".",
      "However, the spokeswoman also said Meloni's trip was being \"closely coordinated\" with the institutions, and underlined that handling trade policy was a job for the EU.",
      "The EU negotiates on behalf of all member states, and no single country can negotiate lower tariffs for its own benefit.",
      "Meloni's team appears clear on this and Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that Meloni \"isn't going to negotiate for Italy against Europe but is going to champion a European stance\".",
      "Ultimately the Italian leader's mission may be to emphasise to Trump that the EU is keen to reach a zero-tariff agreement and commit to buying American \u2013 especially when it comes to defence and liquified natural gas (LNG).",
      "And, in more hushed tones, she may also tell him that Europe is in no rush to make any deals with China.",
      "\"I don't know how public this will be but I think there will be some anti-China discourse as an incentive for the US administration,\" Riccardo Alcaro said.",
      "At home, party allies were singing Meloni's praises before her plane to Washington even left the ground.",
      "\"This meeting shows Giorgia Meloni's courage and stature,\" said Brothers of Italy (FdI) MP Augusta Montarulli - although Senator Giovanbattista Fazzolari, somewhat less encouragingly, warned the trip would be \"full of potential pitfalls\".",
      "And centre-left opposition parties took the opportunity to berate Meloni's proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"I have a feeling that upon her return Meloni will be flying the Trump flag rather than Italy's or Europe's,\" said Peppe Provenzano of the Democratic Party (PD).",
      "\"I hope to be proven wrong.\"",
      "At an awards ceremony in Rome on Tuesday, Meloni addressed a room packed with entrepreneurs and business leaders \u2013 the very same who stand to lose the most from Trump's tariffs.",
      "Looking ahead to her trip to Washington, she chuckled nervously.",
      "\"As you can imagine,\" she joked, \"I'm feeling no pressure at all.\""

Some 500,000 people have been newly displaced or uprooted once more, with no safe place to go, it estimates.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it has killed \"hundreds of terrorists\" in strikes while troops have advanced into several areas in the north and the south. It has established a new corridor that cuts the southern city of Rafah off from neighbouring Khan Younis and has designated 30% of Gaza as an \"operational security perimeter\".",
      "On Wednesday, Israel Katz said Israel's policy was to \"first and foremost make every effort to bring about the release of all hostages\" still being held there and to \"build a bridge to defeat Hamas later on\".",

      "This year's 24-hour programme from SVT Play, the streaming platform for Sweden's national broadcaster, began on Tuesday - a week ahead of schedule because of the warmer weather this April.",
      "The broadcast has become a \"slow TV\" phenomenon, cultivating a loyal fanbase since its inception in 2019.",
      "Cait Borjesson, 60, who has been hooked to the annual livestream since she stumbled upon it during the Covid-19 pandemic, said her TV had been on for 16 straight hours since it began on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's unbelievably relaxing,\" she said. \"There's the natural sounds of the birds, the wind, the trees. It gives you a sense that you're in nature even if you're not\".",
      "For Cait, watching the migration has become a yearly tradition, so much so that she books time off work to fully immerse herself in the three-week broadcast.",
      "She said the stream was \"like therapy\" which had helped her anxiety and panic attacks.",
      "And she is not alone. SVT's livestream has a wide audience, including a Facebook group boasting more than 77,000 members who come together to share their memorable moments, emotional reactions to the broadcast and their shared fascination of the migration.",
      "A major part of their journey captured by SVT is through the village of Kullberg in northern Sweden, next to the Angerman. The animals are known as moose in North America, and elk in Europe.",
      "Goran Ericsson, dean of the faculty of forest sciences at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and science advisor for the broadcast, said the elk migrate back to the summer ranges after aggregating in spots with better temperatures in the winter.",
      "\"Historically, this migration has been going on since the ice age,\" he said. \"During spring and summer, moose are more evenly spread out in the landscape.\"",
      "He added that around 95% of the elk in northern Sweden migrate annually, adding that early migrations were not new with this year's prompted by less snow on the ground.",
      "\"Early springs happen occasionally,\" he said. \"We're still within the normal range of variation.\"",
      "More than 30 cameras are used to capture the elk as they move through the vast landscapes, he added.",
      "The show drew in nearly a million people during its launch in 2019, before garnering nine million viewers in 2024.",
      "Minh-Xuan Truong, a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences who has surveyed viewers of the livestream, said in a fast-paced media environment, people enjoy experiencing nature through this \"slow TV\" style - a genre characterised by long, un-edited and real-time broadcasts.",
      "\"A lot of people say it's like an open window to a forest,\" he says. \"When you ask them if they would prefer having music in the background, or commentary, they say they prefer just having the sound of the wind, the birds and trees.\"",
      "Sweden's woodlands are home to about 300,000 elk. The animal is known in the Scandinavian country as \"King of the Forest\".",

      "However, relations have been on the slide for months. Observers have described the crisis as unprecedented since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.",
      "There had been hopes that tensions would ease after France's foreign minister held talks with Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in Algiers earlier this month.",

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said \"Algerian authorities have chosen escalation\".",

      "However, Retailleau became increasingly involved in the row when Algiers refused to accept around 60 Algerians that his ministry classed as \"dangerous\" and wanted removed.",
      "A deadly February knife attack in the eastern city of Mulhouse would not have happened, Retailleau said, \"if Algeria had respected the law and its obligations\".",
      "Macron sought to clear the air with Algeria's president late last month in what they described as a \"long, frank and friendly exchange\".",
      "Barrot followed that up with a visit to Algiers, saying \"France wishes to turn the page on current tensions\".",

      "Diplomatic tensions escalate as Algeria expels French officials",

      "A high-profile critic of the Algerian government with more than a million followers on social media, Amir DZ was eventually released in a forest.",
      "An incensed Algiers said the consular official's arrest was aimed to \"humiliate\" Algeria and responded by ordering the expulsion of 12 French officials who it said were all under the supervision of France's interior ministry.",
      "Sofiane Chaib, Algeria's secretary of state told national TV on Tuesday that Retailleau had \"full responsibility for this new situation\". He condemned the rationale behind the arrest of the consular official as \"grotesque\".",
      "Retailleau said it was \"unacceptable that France is a playground for Algerian intelligence\".",
      "Paris responded late on Tuesday with the expulsion of 12 Algerian officials, and recalled its ambassador St\u00e9phane Romatet for consultations.",
      "Barrot meanwhile said the ambassador would be back in Paris within 48 hours, but said that his government would eventually have to resume dialogue with Algiers.",
      "\"If we want results for the French people, sooner or later we'll have to have a frank, level-headed and challenging dialogue,\" he said."

      "Earlier this month another government lawyer told Judge Xinis that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been deported on 15 March because of an \"administrative error\". The justice department then suspended that attorney.",

      "\"The only mistake that was made is a lawyer put an incorrect line in a legal filing that's since been relieved,\" he added.",
      "A contempt of court ruling would escalate the Trump administration's constitutional showdown with the judiciary, finding that it had disregarded an independent and equal branch of US government.",

      "While the US Supreme Court last Friday partially upheld Judge Xinis's ruling in favour of Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, the justices also questioned whether she exceeded her authority when she directed the government to \" effectuate\" his return.",
      "Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda is one of more than 200 Venezuelans and Salvadorans, labelled  by Trump officials as gang members, who were deported to the El Salvador mega-prison on 15 March.",
      "Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen announced that he would travel to El Salvador on Wednesday in the hope of visiting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda to \"check on his wellbeing\" and ask the country's government for his release."

    "story": [
      "Joe Biden has used his first speech since leaving office to criticise the Trump administration's welfare policies.",
      "The ex-US president told a conference in Chicago that the government had \"taken a hatchet\" to the Social Security system, which Donald Trump and Elon Musk - who is leading the White House's cost-cutting efforts - say is beset by fraud.",
      "The administration wants to cut staff at the agency responsible for spending $1.6 trillion (\u00a31.2 trillion) in benefits a year.",
      "Biden did not refer to Trump by name during his speech on Tuesday, but said: \"In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breath-taking.\"",
      "He described Social Security as a \"sacred promise\", adding: \"We know just how much Social Security matters to people's lives.\"",
      "Biden - who was speaking at a disability rights event - did not address his departure from the White House or the 2024 presidential election.",
      "The Social Security Agency (SSA) provides a base income for people in the US who are retired or cannot work because of a disability. It covers about 67 million Americans, primarily older citizens.",
      "Democratic politicians have accused the Trump administration of planning sweeping Social Security cuts.",
      "The White House accuses them of scaremongering, citing the Republican president's promises never to cut Social Security payments to American retirees.",
      "Trump has previously said he intends only to target fraudulent claims and payments to illegal immigrants.",
      "Members of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency have been making cuts to the agency staff since February, with the target of slashing 7,000 jobs - about 10% of its total staff.",
      "Musk has described Social Security as \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time\".",
      "On Tuesday, Trump signed an order preventing illegal immigrants and \"other ineligible people\" from obtaining social security payments.",
      "Before Biden's Chicago speech, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president was \"absolutely certain\" about protecting benefits for \"law-abiding tax-paying American citizens and seniors\".",
      "\"He will always protect that programme,\" she added.",
      "In a post on X, the SSA - which is now controlled by a Trump appointee - said Biden had been \"lying\" during his Chicago speech.",
      "Since leaving office, Biden has kept a relatively low profile. In February, he signed with Creative Artists Agency, the Los Angeles talent agency that represented him between 2017-20.",
      "Barack Obama also criticised the Trump administration on Tuesday, saying on X that its decision to freeze more than $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard University was \"unlawful and ham-handed\".",
      "Trump is freezing the fund because Harvard said it would not make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices that he argues are key to fighting alleged antisemitism on campus.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:11:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",
      "\"It will be another step in our evolution\".",

      "The assault rifles and pistols arrived in Haiti stashed in two cardboard boxes, nestled among packages of food and clothes, on a cargo ship stacked with rust-red shipping containers.",
      "They had come from the US, which one expert describes as a \"supermarket\" feeding an arms race among gangs that have brought chaos to the Caribbean island nation.",
      "An investigation by the BBC World Service and BBC Verify traced the two boxes' journey, showing how weapons from the US reach Haiti. It reveals a chain of lax laws, absent checks and suspected corruption used by traffickers to bypass a UN embargo.",
      "The seizure",
      "Haitian police announced in April 2024 that they had seized the two boxes. They contained 12 assault rifles, 14 pistols and 999 ammunition cartridges.",
      "A police photo clearly shows weapons from two different US-based manufacturers.",
      "The shipment had travelled nearly 1,200km (746 miles) from Fort Lauderdale in Florida to Cap-Haitien in northern Haiti, on the Rainer D cargo ship.",
      "The shipping container was filled in a warehouse yard in Fort Lauderdale, according to a UN Panel of Experts, which is tasked with monitoring sanctions on Haiti and investigated the shipment.",
      "Haitians in the US frequently ship much-needed food and other items to the country.",
      "A man named Anestin Predestin told the Miami Herald that in late February 2024, he was leasing out space in the container.",
      "He told the newspaper that a man who gave his name as \"Diamortino\" put in two boxes saying they contained \"clothes\" \u2013 and that he was shocked to learn later they had contained weapons.",
      "The BBC's attempts to contact Mr Predestin were unsuccessful.",
      "It is not clear where the guns had been bought. Guns are not manufactured in Haiti, and previous seizures have included guns bought in Florida.",
      "Sometimes dubbed the \"gunshine state\", Florida was one of about 30 states where, until 2024, private, unlicensed sellers could sell firearms, for example at gun shows and online, without doing background checks. As president, Joe Biden tightened these rules nationally.",
      "The UN panel says two Haitian brothers based in the US had used \"straw buyers\" \u2013 individuals buying on their behalf \u2013 to buy the weapons in the seized shipment.",
      "Experts say this is a common method, often with the guns transported in multiple shipments of small quantities, a process named \"ant trafficking\".",
      "Shipping",
      "The container was shipped by the Florida-based shipping company Alliance International Shipping, Haitian police say.",
      "Alliance International Shipping does not own vessels travelling to Haiti, but buys space on ships and sells it on to clients such as Mr Predestin.",
      "The company's president, Gregory Moraille, said in a statement to the BBC that it provides empty containers to customers, but does not physically interact with the cargo.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we have no viable means of preventing illicit shipments,\" he says, adding the firm co-operates with authorities and has many staff originating from Haiti.",
      "\"Tragically, many of our own families have been victims of gun violence in Haiti,\" he adds.",
      "Leaving the US",
      "The BBC contacted US Customs and Border Protection to ask whether the shipment could have been checked as it left the US, but received no response.",
      "The UN panel said last September that US searches had increased, but \"the vast majority of the 200 containers heading from South Florida to Haiti every week are not inspected\".",
      "A former official with the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), Bill Kullman, told the BBC that checks on outgoing cargo are \"very scattershot\" and the volume of shipments is \"incredible\".",
      "Arriving in Haiti",
      "Haitian police say they discovered the weapons in a \"targeted search\" of the container.",
      "According to the UN panel, a senior Haitian customs official had put one of the boxes containing weapons in his vehicle and was arrested and sacked a few days later.",
      "Police said they were seeking a man called Wilmane Jean, who is named in the customs data as the consignee for the shipment - the person responsible for receiving it.",
      "The BBC understands from sources in Haiti that he is a customs broker, is on the run and is suspected of being connected with gang activity in the north of the country.",
      "A previous UN report says Haitian customs operations suffer from a lack of capacity, corruption among senior officials, and threats and attacks from gangs.",
      "BBC attempts to contact Haitian customs authorities for comment were unsuccessful.",
      "The power of the gangs",
      "Around the time the weapons were packed into the shipping container, a wave of gang violence swept through the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.",
      "Gangs freed thousands of inmates from the main prison, and blockaded the capital's ports and airport.",
      "In March 2024, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, unable to return from an overseas trip, agreed to step down.",
      "A record 5,601 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti in 2024, according to the UN. Its agencies say nearly a tenth of the population \u2013 over a million people - have fled their homes and half the population faces acute hunger. Kidnapping and extortion are rife.",
      "Wilson, a handyman from Port-au-Prince, was shot in the leg while trying to flee as gangs fought over territory in his neighbourhood.",
      "\"It was chaos, everyone was running from their homes,\" he told the BBC. \"My leg stopped working. When I looked down, blood was pouring.\"",
      "He is now living alongside hundreds of other people in a school that is being used as a shelter.",
      "Experts say the authorities do not have the capacity to take back control, despite support from an international security force including at least 800 Kenyan police officers.",
      "The gangs have gained territory in the past six months, and now control at least 85% of the capital, says Romain le Cour, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, an NGO with headquarters in Geneva.",
      "Gang members frequently pose on social media with high-calibre weapons. Experts told the BBC some of the guns displayed were definitely made in the US, and others are likely to have been manufactured there too.",
      "However, guns and ammunition \"keep on coming\", says Mr Le Cour, which is \"a massive driver for violence and instability\".",
      "Hundreds of shipments",
      "To investigate the potential scale of trafficking from the US using similar shipping routes, the BBC analysed customs data shared with us by the shipping data platform CargoFax.",
      "We compiled a list of individuals currently under sanctions for alleged gang connections in Haiti, and others who have been arrested in Haiti or the US as suspected arms traffickers.",
      "We checked these names against thousands of records of shipments from the US to Haiti over four years.",
      "In total, 26 people on the list were named as consignees for 286 shipments, which took place before the individuals were put under sanctions or arrested. It is not clear whether these shipments contained weapons.",
      "Listed 24 times as a consignee was Prophane Victor - a former member of Haiti's parliament who was later put under UN and US sanctions for arming gangs and trafficking weapons. He was arrested in Haiti in January.",
      "Can the traffickers be stopped?",
      "\"First and foremost, US authorities are not doing enough,\" says Mr Le Cour.",
      "Mr Kullman, the former US official at the ATF, says there is no legal obligation on gun dealers to report suspicious buyers.",
      "Changes to US gun laws are \"really politically difficult to achieve\", he says, but he would like to see a voluntary code of conduct for firearms sellers covering issues such as sales to suspicious buyers and information sharing.",
      "Also, gun registration - similar to car registration \u2013 is in place in a few states and could be \"really helpful\" if adopted more widely, Mr Kullman adds.",
      "Jonathan Lowy, president of Global Action on Gun Violence, says gun makers are told when trafficked guns are under investigation and are aware which dealers are selling guns to traffickers.",
      "\"Manufacturers cutting off these dealers would put an immediate stop to most trafficking routes from the US.\"",
      "The BBC contacted the ATF and the US Department for Homeland Security for comment, but received no responses.",
      "Mr Le Cour says international scrutiny of the problem has increased, but there is no visible impact: \"We know we have the diagnosis, we know what the symptoms are, but we're not doing anything to actually cure it\".",

      "Beijing insists it will stand firm in the face of Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. It has been trying to reassure everyone that the country is strong and the economy is resilient enough to weather this latest storm.",
      "But this week, Chinese officials have acknowledged the potential for economic pain as a result of the unfolding trade war with the US.",
      "One option for policymakers here is to try to increase domestic consumption to make up for lost export revenue.",
      "China has a massive population and, if they start buying more stuff, Chinese companies won't have to rely as much on trade overseas.",

      "The initiative hopes to turn an economic problem into an economic solution by giving older people a fun avenue to spend more.",
      "Families are not spending enough because they don't feel financially safe - the property crisis has diminished the value of their number one asset: their home. And growing unemployment has also potentially made their job less secure.",
      "Add to the mix an ageing population and low birthrates and the proportion of retirees grows each year, making it harder for the economy to support them.",
      "But what retirees do have is time on their hands and money to spend.",
      "So now they are to be given more opportunities to splurge with special trains designed to take them to sites they might not normally visit - parts of the country further afield, which need a financial shot in the arm.",
      "\"The main places where the silver trains will stop are undeveloped rural areas or small towns with struggling economies,\" says Dr Huang Huang, a research associate from the China Tourism Academy who has been studying the potential impact of this plan.",
      "\"They will consume various products on the trains, but after they pull into a station, they will also visit tourist attractions and traditional villages.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",

(The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:22:25 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",
      "Officials expect it to be cleaved off from the CDC and merged into Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America agency.",

The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",

      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",

      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "summary": "In these major U.S. cities, a family of three earning $100,000 would have a hard time covering basic expenses.",
    "story": [
      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",
      "Schulz's advice for consumers: Build your emergency fund.",

    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Filing a tax extension is easy. But it's important to know what you're getting into, including what to do if you owe money to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Among the notable gainers in early Monday trading were technology stocks including Apple, with the tech giant facing potentially massive price increases to its mainstay products like the iPhone, most of which are manufactured in China. Still, it's unclear how long the reprieve will last, given that President Trump on Sunday denied that he exempted\u00a0any products from his trade war and plans to study new tariffs on electronics components such as semiconductors.",
      "\"Even if President Trump does reach differing trade deals with some countries in the meantime, the lack of a consistent, clear path for trade policy has added to the overall level of uncertainty for markets, with no clear end to that in sight,\" John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst with Oxford Economics, said in a research note. \"So long as the situation lingers, demand for risk assets is likely to suffer, and volatility will remain significantly elevated as a result.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",

      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",

      "\"China's tit-for-tat retaliation in its rapidly escalating trade war with the U.S. exerted some renewed pressure on equities and the dollar today, with bonds still buffeted by expectations of monetary easing and signs of market dislocation,\" John Higgins, chief market economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",

      "The news for markets isn't uniformly grim. The Dow soared nearly 3,000 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their biggest one-day gains in decades after Mr. Trump\u00a0paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with the exception of China, for 90 days.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

      "Some enterprises, from small businesses to nationally recognized brands, have already announced higher prices, citing President Trump's tariffs. While others, from footwear companies to furniture brands, are warning consumers to brace for increased costs to come.",
      "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0Thursday that he expects the tariffs to lead to higher prices on a host of consumers goods, noting that the site's third-party sellers are likely to pass on tariff-related costs.",
      "Some consumers are also preparing for price hikes by\u00a0stocking up on goods\u00a0they think are likely to become more expensive if U.S. \"reciprocal levies\" on dozens of countries,\u00a0which are paused for 90 days, take effect.",
      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. imports remains in place. China, which accounts for nearly a third of all goods imported into the U.S., faces levies of up to 145% for some items. In an escalation of the trade war between the world's two largest economics, Beijing fired back Friday by announcing it will hike duties on American exports from 84% to 125% and deriding Mr. Trump's tariffs as a \"joke.\"",
      "Tariff fees on what you buy",
      "Although the tariffs and retaliatory moves by other countries have yet to hit economic growth, U.S. businesses aren't waiting around. Some are introducing \"tariff surcharges,\" announcing new prices on their websites and in letters to consumers.",
      "Labucq, which sells high-end footwear that is fabricated in Italy, addressed tariffs and their effect on pricing in a recent social media\u00a0post. The company said a 20% U.S. tariff on imports from the European Union, which Mr. Trump announced on April 2 before pausing them, would require the company to hike prices by 10% beginning April 15. Labucq said its pricing will then jump by an additional roughly 10% on May 7, noting the increases are necessary for it to \"remain sustainable.\"",
      "Dame, a sexual wellness brand that makes adult toys and personal care products, has implemented a $5 \"Trump tariff surcharge\" that is automatically added to customers' online shopping carts at checkout.",
      "Dame CEO Alexandra Fine said the fee doesn't cover all of its extra costs and that the company is analyzing its pricing given that most of its products are made in China. \"Our whole industry is in China, so we've already seen the impact,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Fine also said she wants to be transparent with customers about what is happening, rather than quietly inflating prices.",
      "\"The intention of adding the Trump tariff surcharge as a line item at checkout was to remind people that this is an extra tax on us. I wanted people to understand why it's more expensive \u2014 that it's because of political decisions that were made,\" she said.",
      "Other companies are also moving to raise prices. In a quarterly earnings call last month, a senior executive with U.S. chip maker Micron said some of its products would be subject to higher U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and that it plans to \"pass those costs along to our customers.\"",
      "Honeywell Building Automation, which designs safety and efficiency systems for buildings, in early March announced new pricing related to fresh tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada. The company started applying a 6.4% \"tariff surcharge\" on its building management systems, excluding software and subscription services, saying the move was necessary \"to mitigate the impact of tariffs.\" Honeywell also said it would eliminate the extra duty \"as soon as such tariffs are no longer in force.\"",
      "Lemonade out of lemons",
      "Other companies are using the situation as a promotional tool. While it's true that consumers could eventually pay more if they wait to purchase furniture, electronics, automobiles and more, \"pre-tariff sales\" play into consumers' fear that prices could rise, and can be an effective way to boost sales, according to experts.",
      "\"The tariffs are injecting uncertainty into the marketplace and when there is high uncertainty, consumers tend to overestimate their losses, so they try to hedge their losses as much as possible in a very irrational way,\" Denish Shah, professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "And in times of market uncertainty, explains Denish, consumers are prone to panic-buying.",
      "\"They tend to stockpile necessities, fearing that tomorrow, suddenly, prices could go up. So they'll say, 'Let me try to accelerate all the purchases I can that I would have made anyway,'\" he said.",
      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world. It sources ingredients from small farms in Guatemala, Iceland, India, Spain, Turkey, Vietnam and more. Over the weekend, the spice importer announced\u00a0a \"spring cleaning-turned-impromptu Tariff sale,\" marking down all products by 20%, through Tuesday.",
      "\"When we planned this sale, we thought it'd be a routine springtime promotion, but in the last few days it has turned into something very, very different,\" Burlap & Barrel wrote in a social media post. The company said that it's waiting to see how tariffs are applied to its products, but it's sure that they \"will be bad for our business,\" given that it cannot easily overhaul its supply chains.",
      "The company states that it is running the sale \"To show that we're serious about not raising our prices, and to finance another year or purchasing from smallholder farmers in the face of economic instability and political crisis.\"",
      "Another company, Freewrite, sent an email to customers on Friday urging them to buy its digital typewriters before it hikes prices on its China-made products next week due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Everyone, including our contract manufacturing partners, is helping us explore our options, but the truth is that it is incredibly difficult to move factories. It takes careful planning, huge expense and much more time than we have,\" Freewrite CEO Adam Leeb wrote in the email. \"On Monday, we will be raising prices. Not because we want to, but because we have to.\"",
      "Large chains are putting their own spin on tariff-related promotions. Furniture maker Raymour & Flanigan is urging customers to \"lock in pre-tariff pricing\" in a banner on its website.

    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday his state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.",
      "The suit will argue Mr. Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China or a 10% tariff on all imports is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.",
      "The lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will argue that enacting such tariffs requires approval from Congress, Newsom's office said in a news release.",
      "\"No other state will be more impacted by the impacts of this,\" Newsom said at a Wednesday press conference alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta in the Central Valley.",
      "\"Already, vendors have warned us that they're going to pass the costs of Trump's tariffs onto the state of California,\" Bonta said.",
      "Bonta and Newsom noted that the lawsuit will be the 14th in less than 14 weeks that California has filed against the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're asking the court to rein in the president,\" Bonta said.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country. California's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration. The government briefly imposed steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries\u00a0last week, before pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days \u2014 but Mr. Trump left in place a 10% tariff on most imported goods, and hiked levies on imports from China to a total of 145%.",
      "Newsom said the tariffs have, in effect, resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage in California, which has the largest economy among the states and is a massive exporter of goods.",
      "\"No state is poised to lose more than the state of California,\" Newsom said.",
      "California's lawsuit makes it the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs. The state will ask the court to immediately block the tariffs.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "summary": "The owner of a small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida, says her company is facing up to $1 million in tariff payments this year alone under the Trump administration's new tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung says the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge said Wednesday that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants who were bound for El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a 46-page decision that the government's actions on March 15 \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Those actions, he wrote, are \"sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.\"",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders \u2014 especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The judge's ruling marks the most direct rebuke of the Trump administration amid its escalating tensions with the federal judiciary, which have particularly grown over challenges to the president's efforts surrounding immigration.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-used law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. Administration officials will also have the chance to suggest \"other methods\" of coming into compliance with the order, Boasberg wrote.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said the administration will seek immediate relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "\"The president is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Boasberg, who sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., was overseeing a challenge brought by a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. The judge swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, after convening an emergency hearing, told government lawyers in-person that they should return people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed to El Salvador back to the U.S.",
      "A written order issued shortly after blocked the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities.",
      "But the judge said that despite his written and oral directives, the government did not stop the removal process, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration's actions sparked questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order. The judge wrote in his opinion that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and potentially live witness testimony under oath if needed.",
      "In the last hearing on the matter, a Justice Department attorney named two Department of Homeland Security officials and one State Department official as his points of contact after the judge's decision but said he did not know who directed the planes to continue their flights.",
      "Boasberg found that the Trump administration failed to dispel of any concerns that they violated his injunction, and during further proceedings, declined to \"admit to a grave mistake, explain how it transpired, and detail plans to rectify it.\"",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members reached the Supreme Court late last month. The high court last week said that the Trump administration could resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants it claims are Tren de Aragua members under the law, but only if they are given due process.",
      "The high court also said that migrants challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act must seek judicial review through habeas petitions filed in the district where they are detained. As a result, the dispute before Boasberg in Washington, D.C., should instead be filed in Texas, where the Venezuelan migrants are confined, the Supreme Court said.",
      "Boasberg wrote that the Supreme Court's order \"does not affect \u2014 let alone moot \u2014 the compliance inquiry presently teed up here.\"",
      "The Trump administration invoked the state-secrets privilege in an effort to keep details out of Boasberg's reach in his efforts to find out more information about the two flights. But the judge found it is \"exceedingly doubtful that the privilege applies here\" because he was not asking about diplomatic agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, or the operational specifics of how the deportations were arranged.",
      "\"Instead, the court is simply seeking to confirm times and numbers: how many passengers the two flights carried, whether they were all deported pursuant to the proclamation, and when they were transferred out of U.S. custody,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The court is skeptical that such information rises to the level of a state secret.\"",
      "The judge also rejected the Trump administration's contentions that his order infringed on the president's authority, saying it merely restricted executive actions, which courts routinely do.",
      "\"It in no way invaded any Article II powers, despite defendants' effort to incant new ones into existence,\" he wrote. \"In any event, even if the TRO did somehow overstep the court's Article III power, defendants cannot now evade a contempt charge on that basis.\"",
      "Boasberg said that if the Trump administration and Justice Department do not prosecute his criminal contempt of court case, he will appoint someone who will.",

    "summary": "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act, a White House official confirmed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live, a White House official confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The president has voiced frustration with the 1973 law and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Real Clear Politics first reported Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the law.",
      "A White House source was granted anonymity as the announcement is not official.",
      "It's not yet exactly clear how Mr. Trump would alter the use of the law, since only Congress can change or repeal it, but it would likely come through the federal rule-making process. The law was established to protect species of wildlife, fish and plants that have been depleted enough to be in danger of extinction.",
      "Last week, the president directed agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "One step the administration is considering is to repeal the definition of 'harm,' which would remove nearly all habitat protections for endangered species across the country. Currently, if any business or activity harms a protected species, it's a violation of the law, as established by the ESA. The law defines \"harm\" as including \"any activity that can modify a species' habitat.\" Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to most species, since many aren't \"taken\" or killed to the point of extinction.. By eliminating this legal definition of \"harm,\" it would clear the way for many forms of economic development, including logging, oil and gas drilling, or critical mineral mining that could eradicate a species, environmentalists say.",
      "\"We'll go to court to fight as many of these rollbacks as possible,\" said Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The federal government is large and they're throwing everything at the wall hoping to overwhelm us, but we'll do our damnedest to make sure nothing becomes permanent.\"",
      "The Endangered Species Act was established in 1973 to protect \"various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States that had been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untampered by adequate concern and conservation.\" By designating\u00a0 species with a protected status, this ensures that the ecosystems where the species live will be conserved and steps are taken to help support the species to avoid extinction. This, by extension, means that Congress and federal agencies will work with state and local governments to address water resources that impact species, as well as habitat.",
      "Critics of the Endangered Species Act claim the law goes far beyond the initial intent and is overly burdensome. Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, has frequently suggested changes to the ESA and last month proposed the Endangered Species Amendment Act of 2025. He said in a statement, \"The Endangered Species Act has consistently failed to achieve its intended goals and has been warped by decades of radical environmental litigation into a weapon instead of a tool.\"",
      "Much of what the Trump administration is proposing, by sunsetting regulations and overhauling the ESA, aligns with Westerman's bill.\"Environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan last year.",
      "Environmentalists, however, are concerned about weakening the law.",
      "\"This is a full-out assault on America's heritage,\" said Andrew Wetzler, the senior vice president of nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"If Trump is successful, it will turn the ESA into a shell of itself, and this would be open season for our most important wildlife.\"",
      "In the 50 years since the law was enacted, the ESA has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News reported in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish: salmon and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",

      "Abrego Garcia's case has sparked a series of court proceedings, during which a federal judge ordered the government to return him to the U.S. from the El Salvador supermax prison, CECOT.",

      "Sen. Van Hollen said he hoped to meet with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele. Instead, he met with Vice President F\u00e9lix Ulloa on Wednesday. During that meeting, Van Hollen said that Ulloa indicated he would need a little more time to arrange an in-person prison meeting between Abrego Garcia and the senator.",
      "However, when the senator offered to return next week, he said Ulloa told him he could not promise a meeting would happen at all. Van Hollen was also denied a phone call with Abrego Garcia. Ulloa suggested that the requests be handled by the U.S. Embassy instead.",
      "\"We have an unjust situation here,\" Van Hollen said during a livestreamed news conference. \"The Trump administration is lying about Abrego Garcia. The American courts have looked at the facts.\"",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation",
      "During his update, Sen. Van Hollen emphasized that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported, as he had been granted a \"withholding of removal\" order from an immigration judge.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia is legally in the U.S.,\" Van Hollen said. \"An immigration judge found years ago that it would put his life in danger if he was returned to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) in March as he was leaving his job in Baltimore, Maryland and returning home to Prince George's County. On March 15, he was deported to El Salvador on a plane with more than 200 other migrants that the Trump administration claims had gang affiliations.",
      "ICE later admitted that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an \"administrative error,\" however, they did not take action to return him to the U.S.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to MS-13",
      "The Trump administration has said that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his attorney and family deny. He also has no criminal history in any country.",
      "\"The case of Abrego Garcia does not have to do with MS-13,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but they have not found that. In fact, recently, a U.S. federal court judge said that the Trump administration did not have evidence to support the claim that he had ever been part of MS-13.\"",
      "Why can't El Salvador return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.?",
      "During his update in El Salvador, Sen. Van Hollen questioned why Abrego Garcia is still being held at CECOT and asked if the government has any evidence of Abrego Garcia's gang ties.",
      "\"The government of El Salvador has no evidence that he is part of MS-13, so why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CECOT?\" the senator questioned.",
      "According to Van Hollen, the vice president said the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia at CECOT.",
      "When asked again why El Salvador could not release Abrego Garcia, Vice President Ulloa referred to a statement that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele gave while visiting the White House, saying the country cannot smuggle Abrego Garcia back into the U.S."

    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Centers as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",

      "Washington \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Justice Department is filing a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education for \"discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports\" in what she alleged is a violation of Title IX.",
      "\"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\" Bondi said. \"This is about sports, this is also about these young womens' personal safety.\"",
      "The move marks an escalation between the Trump administration and Maine over the issue. President Trump signed an executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, mandating that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. President Trump said states not in compliance would jeopardize any federal funding they receive.",
      "Then, in a tense moment between Mr. Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, later in February, the president threatened that her state wouldn't get federal funding if it didn't comply with the executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women's sports teams. Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who appeared alongside Bondi on Wednesday, said \"I hope Gov. Mills will recognize that her political feud with the president will deprive the students in her state of much more than the right to fair sporting events.\"",
      "The attorney general outlined that the Justice Department had \"exhausted every other remedy,\" saying it has \"repeatedly notified Maine of its infractions and urged them to remedy the situation to protect women.\" Bondi noted that the administration has stripped grants to Maine through other agencies, and would \"continue to fight for women.\"",
      "The federal government said in its lawsuit filed in Maine's federal court that the state's Department of Education is \"openly and defiantly flouting anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" arguing that the practice violates Title IX's \"core protections.\"\u2028It cited three examples of boys participating in girls sports.",
      "\"The United States accordingly files this action to stop Maine's unapologetic sex-discrimination against female student athletes,\" the Justice Department said in the lawsuit.",
      "Mills pledged to \"vigorously defend our state against the action announced today from the Department of Justice\" in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the fight isn't about women's sports, but \"states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will.\"",
      "\"Let today serve as warning to all states: Maine might be among the first to draw the ire of the Federal government in this way, but we will not be the last,\" Mills said.",
      "Last week, the state of Maine secured a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, blocking the Agriculture Department from \"terminating, freezing, or otherwise interfering with the State's access to federal funds based on alleged Title IX violations without following the process required by federal statute.\" The lawsuit was brought by Maine after the Trump administration cut funds for administrative and technological funds in the state's schools.",
      "The Justice Department's actions against Maine may be followed by similar moves in other states, Bondi said.",
      "\"We're looking at Minnesota, we're looking at California,\" Bondi said. \"We're looking at many, many states, but they are the top two that should be on notice.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Associated Press said its reporters were prevented from attending an Oval Office event with President Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele even though a federal judge had ordered the White House to restore the news outlet's access as of Monday.",
      "An AP spokesperson said in a statement that its \"journalists were blocked from the Oval Office\" on Monday despite the order requiring the White House to rescind its restrictions on the AP's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other places where space is limited when they're open to other members of the White House press pool.",
      "The AP also reported that one of its reporters was not allowed to attend an event on the South Lawn of the White House recognizing the Ohio State University's championship football team that was open to credentialed media, though two AP photographers were permitted to cover it.",
      "A White House official separately confirmed Tuesday night that the White House is changing the makeup of the press pool, which is the small group of rotating journalists who cover the president each day, to remove a spot designated for news wire services like the AP. The official said the pool will instead consist of a second print journalist, and wire reporters will be eligible for the pool's daily print journalist position.",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in response to the changes that the wire services \u2014 the AP, Bloomberg News and Reuters \u2014 play a crucial role in coverage of the presidency and should have their traditional spot in the press pool.",
      "\"The changes to the press pool today show that the White House is \u00a0just using a new means to do the same thing: retaliate against news organizations for coverage the White House doesn't like,\" he said. \"The WHCA is working to find out what this means in practice but what we do know is that restrictions on White House media coverage only hurt the American people who rely on unfiltered journalism to stay informed and make decisions critical to their lives.\"",
      "Daniels said the White House's insistence that they will maintain discretion over the composition of the pool, instead of using regular rotations, \"underscores that the administration remains unwilling to provide guarantees they will not continue to engage in the viewpoint discrimination that was ruled unlawful by a federal court.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled last week that the White House cannot deny AP journalists access to spaces made available to the pool or events open to all credentialed members of the White House press corps because of its refusal to use the name Gulf of America in its Stylebook and reporting. McFadden, who was appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump in his first term, put his order on hold until Monday.",
      "The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of three judges is set to consider Thursday whether to grant the administration's request to pause the district court's decision \u2014 which would reinstate the restrictions on the AP \u2014 while it considers the appeal.",
      "The AP spokesperson said in the statement that the outlet expects \"the White House to restore AP's participation in the pool as of [Monday], as provided in the injunction order.\" The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "The AP, which says its news reporting reaches roughly 4 billion people daily, filed its lawsuit against three senior White House officials after it was informed in February that it would no longer be allowed in places like the Oval Office and on Air Force One as part of the press pool until the AP revised its influential Stylebook to use the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico.",
      "The Stylebook is a writing and editing guide that is used by newspapers, magazines and other media outlets throughout the country. It covers a wide range of topics, from abbreviations of state names to describing ages to jargon used in different sports.",
      "In addition to being denied admittance to the press pool, AP reporters have also been turned away from larger events open to the broader White House press corps, the outlet said in court papers.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order renaming the body of water in January. But the AP said it would not update its Stylebook, which is used in newsrooms worldwide, to reflect the change because the president's directive only carries authority within the U.S. The AP said that as an international news agency, it \"must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "McFadden last week said that the White House likely violated the First Amendment when it excluded the AP from press events because of its refusal to change the Gulf of Mexico's name in its Stylebook.",
      "The judge stressed that he is not ordering the Trump administration to grant the AP permanent access to the Oval Office, East Room or other media events, and noted that the AP is not entitled to the permanent press pool access it previously enjoyed.",
      "But McFadden wrote that the AP \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" he wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "As a news wire service, the AP is a regular participant in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds.",
      "One iteration of the press pool, which attends most White House events in the Oval Office and other small spaces, has 21 members. The smallest iteration, which travels with the president aboard Air Force One, has 13 members. The AP typically had two of the 13 core spots in the press pool.",
      "While the White House Correspondents' Association historically oversaw the composition of the pool, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced in February that the White House would choose which credentialed journalists would make up the press pool.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed executive orders that seek to punish four major law firms for their legal work and lawyers who worked for them.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday said she will prevent the Trump administration from enforcing portions of an executive order that targets the law firm Susman Godfrey, finding that the directive likely retaliates against the firm and its clients for their exercise of constitutionally protected speech.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan granted the firm's request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing and said Susman Godfrey is likely to succeed on its claims that the executive order, signed by President Trump last week, violates the First and Fifth Amendments. She specifically blocked the administration from enforcing provisions relating to federal contracting and restricting Susman employees' access to federal buildings and from engaging with government workers.",
      "AliKhan said while delivering her ruling from the bench that the government \"sought to use its immense power to dictate the positions that law firms may or may not take,\" which threatens the foundation of legal representation in the U.S. She said the executive order is \"based on a personal vendetta\" against Susman Godfrey.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" AliKhan, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said.",
      "Following the hearing, the firm said in a statement it is grateful to the court for addressing the unconstitutionality of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"This fight is bigger and more important than any one firm. Susman Godfrey is fighting this unconstitutional executive order because it infringes on the rights of all Americans and the rule of law. This fight is right, it is just, and we are duty-bound to pursue it,\" it said.",
      "Susman Godfrey is the fourth law firm to succeed in the early stages of lawsuits that challenge executive orders signed by Mr. Trump. The orders, signed over the past few weeks, each threaten the firms with sanctions because of their legal work, as well as lawyers who are currently or were previously on their payrolls.",
      "Susman Godfrey represented Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation lawsuit filed against Fox News over baseless claims it aired about the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump falsely claims was rigged against him. The case ended with a $787 million settlement agreement before the start of the trial. The firm is also representing Dominion in a defamation case against Newsmax, a conservative television network. A jury trial in that dispute is slated to begin at the end of the month.",
      "During the hearing, Donald Verrilli, who is representing Susman Godfrey, called Mr. Trump's executive order \"one of the most brazenly unconstitutional exercises of executive power in the history of this nation.\" He told the court it \"runs roughshod\" over the separation of powers.",
      "Pointing to other law firms that have reached deals with the White House, likely to head-off being targeted by Mr. Trump, Verrilli said they have done so to \"stay on the president's good side.\" Those nine firms have agreed to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono work to causes backed by the president.",
      "\"We're sliding very fast into an abyss,\" Verrilli said. \"There's only one way to stop that slide: for courts to act decisively and act decisively now.\"",
      "In addition to Susman Godfrey, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that seek to punish the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. The firms have all filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the orders, and judges have issued temporary orders\u00a0blocking enforcement of portions of them while the litigation continues.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said at a hearing on Tuesday that everyday Kilmar Abrego Garcia is \"detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm.\"",
    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Maryland \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday admonished the Department of Justice for not complying with her order to facilitate the release of a Maryland man who the Trump administration admitted had been mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador, and ordered expedited discovery in the case.",
      "\"We have to give process to both sides, but we're going to move\u2026 there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding,\" U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis said at the start of a hearing in the case involving Kilmer Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador last month.",
      "Xinis ordered for depositions to be completed by April 23. When the Justice Department suggested they might invoke privilege, Xinis told them\u00a0 \"cancel vacation, cancel other appointments\" and added that she expects \"all hands on deck.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and the Justice Department faced off in Xinis' courtroom Tuesday, one day after El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia. Drew Ensign, a Justice Department attorney, said Tuesday that the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return if he arrived at a port of entry, and continued to dodge straightforward questions on what the Trump administration is doing, if anything, to return the man.",
      "Joseph Mazzarra, acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a filing shortly before the hearing that if Abrego Garcia does show up at a port of entry, he would be detained by the Department of Homeland Security and either removed to a third country or stripped of a legal protection that he was granted in 2019, which forbid immigration authorities from removing him to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "To revoke that legal status, known as withholding of removal, the Department of Homeland Security would have to re-open his immigration case and ask an immigration judge to terminate it.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said before the hearing that she is asking the Trump administration to \"stop playing games with the life of Kilmar.\"",
      "During the proceedings, Xinis said the Justice Department \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" while lawyers for the Justice Department asked for any orders to be stayed after the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Xinis said Tuesday that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm,\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery, or fact finding, in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him.",
      "\"I've gotten nothing, I've gotten no real response [from the government],\" Xinis said, calling the Justice Department's arguments thus far \"two misguided ships passing in the night.\"",
      "Xinis responded to the Justice Department's suggestions that the back and forth is simply a legal dispute, and that there is \"so much daylight between what you keep saying and what the posture of the case is.\"",
      "\"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before she rules on whether to hold the government in contempt of her order, Xinis said.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's filings this week citing the exchange between President Trump and Bukele, in which Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the United States, Xinis said that \"if that were in a court of law \u2014 it would have real infirmities in a trial, in a court of law.\"",
      "\"No press release is going to move the court the same way that sworn, under oath testimony from persons with knowledge,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis had ordered the Justice Department to provide her with answers to three questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and efforts to bring him back to the U.S. after the Supreme Court last week\u00a0affirmed a portion of an earlier order that required the U.S. to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued in a filing that the Trump administration defied the district court and Supreme Court orders by refusing to provide \"even basic information\" about their client's location and what it is doing to follow the directive to return him to the U.S. They asked Xinis to provide three types of relief, including ordering the government to explain why it shouldn't be held in contempt for failure to comply with her prior rulings.",
      "During a hearing Friday, after the high court released its decision, Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, repeatedly said he could not provide information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis said in a written order after the proceedings that the Trump administration \"failed to comply\" with her directive and \"made no meaningful effort to\" obey it.\u00a0 She ordered the government to provide daily updates to the court about Abrego Garcia's location and custodial status, as well as the efforts taken by the administration to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the court Saturday, Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official, said Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, in El Salvador.",
      "\"He is alive and secure in that facility,\" Kozak wrote. \"He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In another declaration filed Sunday, Evan Katz, assistant director for the Removal Division at ICE, said the administration had no updates for the court beyond what had already been shared. The latest filing, submitted Monday from Mazzara said the agency \"does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have been defiant in their response to Xinis' order that they take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and have argued that their obligations are limited only to removing \"any domestic obstacles\" that would impede his ability to return to the U.S., where he has lived since arriving unlawfully in 2011.",
      "Federal courts, they said in a filing Sunday, are powerless \"to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities in March and flown to El Salvador with more than 200 other migrants who are now confined at CECOT. His lawyers have argued that his removal to El Salvador was unlawful, as an immigration judge in 2019 granted him a withholding of removal, a legal status that forbids the Department of Homeland Security from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is likely to face persecution from local gangs.",
      "Numerous Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \u2014 including Solicitor General John Sauer \u2014 have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Savaldor was an \"administrative error\" because he was granted withholding of removal.",
      "But Katz, the ICE official, said in his declaration that Abergo Garcia is no longer eligible for that relief because of his alleged membership in the gang MS-13, which President Trump designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "While the Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant, his lawyers argue that he is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang. They have also said he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case landed before the Supreme Court last week after Xinis issued an order on April 4 that directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return by 11:59 p.m. on April 7.",
      "The Justice Department appealed, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary order pausing that deadline to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant the Trump administration's request to block Xinis' order.",
      "The high court on Thursday upheld part of the decision that required the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, but said the district court should clarify its directive that the Trump administration \"effectuate\" his return.",
      "Xinis moved swiftly in responding, and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to take all available steps to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have claimed that it is up to the Salvadoran government to decide if they want to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. But during a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not \"have the power\" to do so.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\"he said in response to questions from reporters. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.",

      "Ryan Routh's attorneys had asked that their expert be allowed to inspect, photograph and test the rifle in order to evaluate a government expert's findings, as well as test it for other information that they thought was relevant. In Tuesday's order, District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2014 who was nominated by Mr. Trump \u2014 limited the testing to just its operability, with a May 15 deadline.",
      "Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and two firearm charges. His federal trial is scheduled for September, and he's expected to face additional state charges.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump \u2014 then a presidential candidate \u2014 for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. Before the president came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions. He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged last week\u00a0Routh also tried to buy an anti-aircraft weapon online to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane. \"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh allegedly told an associate from whom he hoped to buy the weapon.",

    "story": [
      "Just one day before Mohsen Mahdawi was detained by immigration agents at what he was told was his citizenship interview, the Columbia student and Palestinian activist told CBS News he thought there was a chance the long-awaited appointment could be a trap.",
      "\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mahdawi \u2014 a native of the Israeli-occupied West Bank who has held a green card for the last decade \u2014 told CBS News on the eve of his detention. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?\"",
      "Mahdawi was taken into custody after arriving at his interview in Vermont on Monday. CBS News witnessed federal agents strapping on vests shortly after he walked into the building, emerging about an hour later with Mahdawi in handcuffs.",
      "His attorneys say he was detained under a little-used law allowing foreign nationals to be deported if they pose \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" \u2014 making him the latest student to face detention, including fellow Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi's legal team has petitioned a judge to release him and alleged he is being punished for protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment and his right to due process.",
      "Shortly after Mahdawi's detention, federal Judge William Sessions ordered the Trump administration not to deport him or move him out of the state of Vermont while Sessions reviews the case, granting a request from Mahdawi's attorneys.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment to the State Department, which declined to comment.",
      "Mahdawi \u2014 who says he was set to receive his bachelor's degree in philosophy in May \u2014 co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023 along with Khalil. Mahdawi was later active in protests on Columbia's campus against Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas' terrorist attack launched from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023. His attorneys said in a court filing that Mahdawi \"took a step back\" from organizing the protests in March 2024, before the protests escalated later that spring, with demonstrators forming encampments and occupying a campus building.",
      "The nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests was a political lightning rod, with critics arguing the demonstrations \u2014 and their leaders \u2014 were disruptive and featured antisemitic rhetoric. Columbia is one of several schools to face a freeze in federal funding by the Trump administration, which alleges the Ivy League school \"failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\"",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News last weekend he faced \"threats\" and \"intimidation\" after speaking about the protests in a late 2023 \"60 Minutes\" interview. Shortly after President Trump took office, he also drew the attention of Betar USA, a controversial pro-Israel group that tweeted in January that Mahdawi was on its \"deport list.\"",
      "The group's former Executive Director Ross Glick told CBS News that Betar USA has collected information on thousands of pro-Palestinian activists and passed it on to the Trump administration. He said it's up to the government to decide whether somebody actually supports Hamas: \"Once information is handed off, we're out of the process, right? It's ultimately up to the government, the various officials.\"",
      "Mahdawi pushed back on Betar's criticism, saying groups like Betar \"manipulate information, create lies, and attach them to the profiles of those either students or activists.\" Mahdawi has vehemently denied claims of antisemitism in the Columbia University protests more generally, calling them a \"false accusation.\"",
      "He also told CBS News over the weekend that if he's detained by federal agents, \"I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well.\"",
      "After Khalil was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month, Mahdawi feared he could be ensnared next. Khalil is currently held in Louisiana, and his legal future is uncertain: An immigration judge ruled last week the Trump administration can move forward with deportation but gave his lawyers until late April to file applications for relief. His lawyers have indicated they will appeal the ruling, and they are separately suing the government for his release.",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News he began taking precautions for his own safety, including avoiding public spaces, after Khalil's detention. Still, when he received word of a citizenship appointment, he chose to attend \u2014 though he suspected it may lead to his detention.",
      "\"It's an irony. The irony of destiny. And I accept the outcome,\" Mahdawi said a day beforehand. \"If my story will become another story for the struggle to have justice and democracy in this country, let it be.\"",

And Biden's appearance comes as Democrats have sought to reorganize themselves after the party endured bruising losses in the 2024 elections, while Mr. Trump has continued to hurl criticism at his predecessor in the three months since he returned to office.",
      "Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who served as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration under Biden, introduced Biden, and former Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan are set to make addresses later in the week.",
      "\"We are honored President Biden has selected the 2025 ACRD Conference to address the nation,\" O'Malley, an adviser to the group, said in a statement, while citing \"widespread concern the progress recently made for Social Security will be tragically reversed.\"",
      "The former president's appearance comes as Democratic leaders have warned of threats to Social Security amid the Trump administration's slashing of government programs and agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Concerns about the health of the program amid recent attempts to significantly shrink the agency have abounded.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is leading his members on a number of days of action focused on opposing the Trump administration as Congress is in recess, with a \"Save Social Security Day of Action\" Tuesday. The minority leader held a news conference Tuesday morning, where he stressed that Social Security \"faces an unprecedented assault.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump, Elon Musk and House Republicans think that Social Security is a ponzi scheme,\" Jeffries said, adding that \"it is unacceptable, unconscionable and un-American that Donald Trump, Elon Musk and House Republicans are dismantling and closing Social Security offices, jacking up wait times and preventing hard-working Americans from securing their benefits.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in federal court for a second day in a landmark federal antitrust trial accusing Meta of being a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",

    "summary": "Under a program known as CHNV, migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration can't immediately revoke the deportation protections and work permits of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally under a Biden-era program, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with its plan to terminate the legal status of those migrants on April 24. The administration had warned those affected by its announcement that they would need to self deport by that date or face arrest and deportation by federal immigration agents.",
      "But Talwani suspended the deportation warnings the government had sent and prohibited officials from revoking the legal protection, known as immigration parole, that the Biden administration granted to more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Talwani said those mass parole terminations could not happen without each case being reviewed.",
      "The \"early termination, without any case-by-case justification, of legal status for noncitizens who have complied with DHS programs and entered the country lawfully undermines the rule of law,\" wrote Talwani, who sits on the federal district court in Boston.",
      "Monday's ruling is a significant reprieve for those who arrived under a policy the Biden administration argued promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border unlawfully.",
      "Under that program, known as CHNV, a total of 532,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela were allowed to fly to the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from U.S.-based individuals. Upon entry, they were granted immigration parole and allowed to work in the U.S. lawfully for two years.",
      "Biden administration officials partially credited the policy for a sharp reduction in illegal border crossings by migrants from the four countries whose citizens were eligible to be sponsored. But the program was not implemented without controversy.",
      "Republican-led states challenged the policy's legality in federal court, arguing that the parole authority did not grant the federal government the power to admit such large numbers of foreigners through a program with broad eligibility rules.",
      "The Biden administration paused the initiative for several weeks in 2024 due to concerns about fraudulent applications. It also declined to allow those who arrived under the policy to renew their parole beyond the two-year period, saying they could seek other benefits, like asylum or temporary protected status, to remain in the U.S.",
      "The CHNV policy was paused immediately after President Trump returned to the White House in January. His administration quickly took steps to dismantle parole-based immigration policies, which it argued exceeded the president's authority. Trump administration officials have also argued those allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV initiative were not properly vetted.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would give CHNV beneficiaries 30 days to leave the U.S. voluntarily, or it would seek their arrest and removal from the country. Officials said they would prioritize the arrest of migrants who had failed to apply for another immigration benefit, like asylum or a green card.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin denounced the CHNV policy, claiming it \"unleashed over 530,000 poorly vetted aliens into America, fueling crime and stealing jobs \u2014 forcing our agents in the field to ignore rampant fraud.\"",
      "\"While this ruling delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary (Kristi) Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos, prioritizing the safety of Americans,\" McLaughlin added.",
      "The ruling is another legal setback for the Trump administration and its effort to discontinue Biden administration immigration programs that protect hundreds of thousands of migrants from deportation.",
      "Late last month, a federal judge in California prevented the administration from ending a Temporary Protected Status policy that shields more than 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. from deportation.",

      "President Trump issued a new threat to Harvard University on Tuesday after the federal government froze $2.2 billion in grant funding for the institution, suggesting that the Ivy League school \"should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity.\"",
      "The president's latest statement came after the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution announced Monday that it will reject a list of demands from the Trump administration governing the school's policies and leadership. Harvard is the latest university to be targeted by the Trump administration, which is using federal funding as leverage to try to change internal governance at universities and how they manage student expression on campus.",
      "\"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday. \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\"",
      "Nearly all public and private colleges in the United States are exempt from paying taxes because they are educational organizations, according to the Association of American Universities.",
      "Harvard rejects Trump's demands",
      "The conflict between some universities and the Trump administration stems from pro-Palestinian encampments that grew at Harvard Yard and on other college campuses last year. The Trump administration said at the end of March it was reviewing about $9 billion in grants with Harvard as it investigates alleged antisemitic incidents at colleges.",
      "A letter\u00a0the Trump administration sent Harvard on April 11 demanded several changes, including leadership reforms at the school and an end to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Harvard President Alan Garber responded by saying the university \"will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\"",
      "\"I think so many of us want to work at a place and be part of a community that stands up for its principles, right?\" Harvard political science professor Ryan Enos said. \"If you don't have that, you don't have anything.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment and federal funding",
      "Earlier this year, Harvard announced a hiring freeze in response to \"rapidly shifting federal policies.\" Much of the federal funding Harvard receives goes toward medical and scientific research.",
      "Harvard Medical School, for example, says federal support has \"enabled innovations in cancer immunotherapy, treatments for diabetes and obesity, therapies for autoimmune diseases, the first gene-editing therapy for\u00a0sickle cell disease, and more.\"",
      "\"It's not just that things have been stopped cold, which a lot of it has,\" Enos said. \"One day, they're doing research and then the next day they can't. It's also the fact that they can't plan.\"",
      "But Shabbos Kestenbaum, who received his master's degree from Harvard and campaigned for Mr. Trump, says this sort of penalty on the university is long overdue.",
      "\"What the federal government is doing is saying, 'You have a track record of discrimination, you have a track record of violating the civil rights of your own students, and we're not going to fund this,'\" he said. \"Harvard is trying to, you know, have its cake and eat it too.\"",
      "With Harvard reporting an endowment of more than $53 billion last year, some critics may wonder why the school needs federal funding at all.",
      "\"There is some truth to that, of course. That's why it's important for Harvard to fight,\" Enos said. \"They're sort of digging in for battle, and we all have to prepare to go through that now.\"",

      "A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder, terrorism and other offenses after a fire at the Governor's Residence in Harrisburg forced Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family to evacuate the home early Sunday morning, according to court documents filed in Dauphin County.",
      "Officials said Cody Balmer, 38, hopped a fence and intentionally set a fire at the residence early on Sunday, April 13, while Shapiro and his family were home. Balmer, of Harrisburg, was charged Monday with criminal homicide/attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and more.",
      "Balmer was arraigned on the charges on Monday evening, and a judge denied bail. Earlier Monday, Pennsylvania State Police said Balmer was treated at a hospital for a \"medical event not related to this incident or his arrest.\" He was taken into custody on Sunday in the Harrisburg area.",

We have to be better than this. We have a responsibility to all be better.\"",

      "The Pennsylvania governor said that no one was injured, and the fire was brought under control.",
      "The fire happened after Shapiro, who is Jewish, and his family celebrated the first night of Passover. Shapiro declined to call the fire a hate crime but said that the blaze won't deter him from doing his job or celebrating his faith.",
      "\"I'm not fearful,\" Shapiro said. \"I'm obviously emotional. I'm worried about my family. I want my kids to be OK. When we were in the State Dining Room last night, gathered with the community and family and friends, we told the story of Passover, and it's a story of going from bondage, from slavery, into freedom. I think it's an important story, both literally and figuratively, to tell, and I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us, as they did here last night. I refuse to let anyone who had evil intentions like that stop me from doing the work that I love, stop me from being a leader of this commonwealth and looking out for all Pennsylvanians. I will not be deterred in my work, and I will not be afraid to do that work.\"",

      "\"Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we've received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,\" an emotional Shapiro said. \"We've heard from our fellow governors and first spouses. We've heard from several of the former governors of Pennsylvania. Heard from so many friends and loved ones. We've heard from so many caring citizens of this great commonwealth.

      "One argument took place between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in chief of staff Susie Wiles' office in late March, in the days before Mr. Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs were announced.",
      "The following account is from multiple sources familiar with the meeting. Navarro wanted 25% across-the-board tariffs on all $3 trillion of imported goods. Bessent, who made a career as a Wall Street investor, warned of market turmoil and outlined various scenarios.",
      "Heated words flew.",
      "Navarro sneered: \"You're doing the same thing they did in the first term. Don't pull this. Don't be him.\"",

Musk also publicly advocated for zero tariffs between the United States and the European Union.",
      "Navarro maintained that there should be no negotiations \u2014 the tariffs should be left in place to generate revenue and to muscle manufacturers into domestic production.",
      "But in the days after the \"Liberation Day\" announcement, financial markets reeled, proving correct some of Trump's advisers' predictions. Trillions of dollars were erased from the major stock indexes and the bond market sent alarming signals. Wall Street investment firms like Goldman Sachs predicted higher odds of recession and some of America's top CEOs publicly expressed their concerns.",

    "summary": "A Columbia protest leader was taken into custody at a citizenship interview, his lawyers say, as the Trump administration pushes to deport fellow Columbia activist Mahoud Khalil.",
    "story": [
      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian man involved in protests at Columbia University, was taken into custody by federal agents Monday when he arrived at a citizenship interview in Vermont, his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "Mahdawi's detention comes as the Trump administration fights to deport fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil.",
      "Mahdawi's legal team told CBS News federal agents informed them the Trump administration detained Mahdawi under an obscure law allowing deportations if the Secretary of State decides someone poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The administration cited the same provision to detain Khalil. Mahdawi's lawyers filed a petition in court asking for his release, claiming his detention violated the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian,\" his attorney, Luna Droubi, alleged in a statement. \"His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News' request for comment to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to questions.",
      "Mahdawi's attorney Luna Droubi said in a statement Mahdawi's legal team has \"not received confirmation as to his whereabouts despite numerous attempts to locate him.\" Federal Judge William Sessions temporarily barred the government from removing Mahdawi from Vermont on Monday.",
      "Mahdawi was born in a West Bank refugee camp and has been a U.S. lawful permanent resident for the last decade, according to his lawyers. He completed a philosophy program at Columbia late last year, and was expected to graduate in May before seeking a master's degree from the university this fall.",
      "Khalil and Mahdawi co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023, Mahdawi's lawyers said in court documents. Khalil later spoke at campus protests over Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, which began after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Mahdawi has drawn attention in the past. Betar USA \u2014 a controversial pro-Israel group that regularly encourages the Trump administration to detain pro-Palestinian protest leaders \u2014 tweeted a video of Mahdawi in January and said he's on the organization's \"deport list.\"",
      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told CBS News in a statement the group has \"provided thousands of names of jihadis to the Trump Administration of visitors to America who support Hamas and will continue to.\"",
      "Mahdawi's lawyers say he has backed a \"peaceful political solution\" to the Palestinian conflict. In a 2023 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Mahdawi told Bill Whitaker about a campus rally during which an unidentified person yelled an antisemitic statement. Mahdawi said he was \"shocked\" and told the person, \"you don't represent us.\"",
      "Mahdawi is the latest student to face immigration detention. Khalil, who also holds a green card, was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month. The government is seeking his removal from the country, accusing him of supporting Hamas and participating in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" When asked to provide evidence for Khalil's detention, the government cited a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that said that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives but did not provide any evidence of Khalil declaring support for Hamas.",
      "Tufts University\u00a0student\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk was detained weeks later, with her attorneys claiming she was targeted for co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper.",
      "Khalil and Ozturk are both detained in Louisiana. A federal immigration judge ruled last week the government can move forward with its push to deport Khalil, but he has until later this month to seek relief from deportation. His lawyers have suggested they will appeal, and he's separately suing over his detention. Ozturk is also suing for her release, and her attorneys faced off against the Trump administration in a hearing Monday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the practice of revoking visas, writing on X after Khalil's arrest, \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:54:26 -0400",
    "summary": "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said \"of course I'm not going to do it\" about returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to an El Salvadoran prison.",
    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S.",
      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders met. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the man, who lives in\u00a0Maryland, from custody, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on their efforts to return Abrego Garcia. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department noted Bukele's Oval Office comments. The filing also said that \"DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In a statement after the meeting, Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura said \"the Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. An\u00a0analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Among those deported was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children. He is a native of El Salvador, and his wife is a U.S. citizen.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed openness to sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to prisons in El Salvador, saying his administration is studying the laws right now to see if that's possible. Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\"",
      "\"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\"",
      "Legal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case,\u00a0Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",

      "Vance \u2014 an Ohio State alumnus \u2014 tried to lift up the trophy, but it appeared to separate from its base as the vice president bobbled it in his hands. With the Marine Corps Band's rendition of Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" still blaring in the background, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was standing next to Vance, swiftly recovered the fumble.",
      "Vance later shrugged off the near-turnover, posting on X, \"I didn't want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.\"",
      "The moment came after Vance and President Trump spoke at the celebration, flanked by Ohio State players and coaches. The Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame 34-23 in the title game on Jan. 20 \u2014 the same day as Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In a set of brief remarks, Mr. Trump congratulated the Buckeyes on their victory and praised the state of Ohio more generally: \"We won that state in a landslide.\"",
      "Vance talked up the team, but also took a moment to needle Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The two agreed to a friendly wager on an Ohio State-University of Texas playoff game earlier this year, with the loser agreeing to wear the winning team's jersey and drop off food and beer from their home state \u2014 a bet Vance claimed Cruz has \"still not paid up on.\"",
      "\"I don't like losing any bet, but I really don't want to lose a bet to Ted Cruz,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance, an Ohio native who got his bachelor's degree from Ohio State before attending Yale Law School, also excoriated an audience member who he claimed wore a hat for Ohio's archnemesis, the University of Michigan. \"I'm about to tell the Secret Service he's got a dangerous weapon,\" Vance said."

    "summary": "Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral student at Tufts University, was detained on March 25 after her visa was revoked.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Vermont considered Monday whether to release a Tufts University Ph.D. student as she challenges her detention as a violation of her free speech rights.",
      "Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at the Massachusetts university, was detained by immigration authorities last month outside of her apartment because her student visa had been revoked. The Trump administration has said hundreds of students studying at American universities have had their visas taken away or were stopped from reentering the United States after they were accused of publicly expressing support for Palestinians.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys argue that her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, and are seeking to have her either released on bail or, as an alternative, transferred to Vermont from Louisiana. She is currently detained at a federal immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Jessie Rossman, one of Ozturk's lawyers, told U.S. District Judge William Sessions during a hearing that the \"sole basis\" of Ozturk's arrest was an editorial she co-authored in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its handling of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate in an effort to \"hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\"",
      "Ozturk's attorneys also argued that the government's decision to transport Ozturk across three states \u2014 Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont \u2014 before she was sent to Louisiana was unusual and designed to punish Ozturk for protected speech.",
      "\"This was done to chill her speech and send a clear, chilling message to everyone watching,\" Rossman said, adding that the government knew the public was paying attention. \"If you engage in speech that the administration disagrees with, you will be punished.\"",
      "The Justice Department has argued that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's case under federal immigration law, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has initiated removal proceedings against her. Michael Drescher, a Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk must seek release through the immigration courts.",
      "\"Congress has been crystal clear on that,\" he said, adding that she can seek review of an adverse decision from a Board of Immigration Appeals from a federal appeals court.",
      "Sessions and the government engaged in a debate over the scope of habeas jurisdiction \u2014 which allows courts to review the legality of a person's detention \u2014 and discussed whether the court has the authority to consider Ozturk's detention amid ongoing removal proceedings, as well as whether her petition named the proper immigration officials.",
      "The judge suggested that if the court found a constitutional violation but was told it lacked the authority to order her release due to an immigration detention order, it could create a troubling legal conflict.",
      "\"Then we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Sessions warned.",
      "Sessions noted that the case stands at the intersection of immigration law and a detainee's right to challenge the legality of their confinement.",
      "\"The Constitution rubs up against the [Immigration and Nationalities Act] perhaps in some areas but fundamentally, the court's responsibility is to make an assessment about constitutional liberties and if there is a constitutional violation here, certainly that takes precedence,\" he said.",
      "Noor Zafar, a lawyer for Ozturk, argued she is not contesting the executive branch's authority to exercise its discretion to detain people pending their removal from the U.S., but rather the basis for Ozturk's detention.",
      "Zafar said the circumstances surrounding Ozturk's detention are \"extraordinary,\" as immigration authorities made the decision to take her into custody in retaliation for her speech.",
      "The judge did not decide immediately whether to grant the government's request to dismiss Ozturk's habeas petition, or order her returned to Vermont from Louisiana. But he raised the prospect of bringing Ozturk back to Vermont for a bail hearing while he addresses her constitutional challenge to her detention.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers also argued that the existing record is sufficient to make a determination on bail, and said that the government has had multiple opportunities to present evidence against allowing her to be released while her case proceeds, but has failed to do so. Her legal team said that there is no reason to believe the government would present new evidence to counter their case, which would demonstrate that Ozturk has met the necessary bail requirements.",
      "Drescher, in response, referred back to the Immigration and Nationality Act, asserting that the law presents limits for a court to release the petitioner on bail.",
      "\"There is a legitimate question as to whether the INA would permit such a release,\" he argued.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, one of Ozturk's attorneys, told CBS Boston on Sunday that it's \"pretty clear, based on the lack of evidence that the government has submitted, that she's done anything that's violated our immigration laws.\"",
      "\"It's essentially just trying to silence and show everyone from speaking out and creating basically this, you know, Soviet-style era of watch your neighbor and report on what your neighbor is doing to us,\" Khanbabi said.",
      "Ozturk's case arose after she was arrested by immigration agents outside of her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment before attending an iftar dinner. She was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and then to Lebanon, New Hampshire, according to court filings. From there, she was brought to an ICE field office in St. Albans, Vermont, and was held there overnight. The following morning, on March 26, Ozturk was taken to the airport in Burlington, Vermont, and flown to Louisiana, where she was transferred to the immigration detention facility in Basile.",
      "During the hearing, Sessions scrutinized the timeline of events from when Ozturk was taken into custody to when she was flown to Louisiana. A federal judge in Massachusetts had issued an order on the night of March 25 \u2014 hours after Ozturk's arrest \u2014 that blocked the government from moving her out of the state.",
      "The judge said the Massachusetts court \"clearly expressed in a judicial order from an Article III judge\" a desire to maintain jurisdiction over Ozturk's case. That order, Sessions said, \"had no impact upon what ultimately happened to\" Ozturk, as she was transferred to Louisiana anyway.",
      "Drescher, the Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk was already in Vermont when that order was issued, which \"created complications\" of how to interpret and respond to it.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts emerged as a key question in the challenge to her detention, as the Justice Department has repeatedly sought to have her case transferred to Louisiana because it is where she is detained.",
      "Earlier this month, a Massachusetts judge rejected an earlier effort by the Justice Department to throw out the challenge to Ozturk's detention after she was first taken into custody, but moved the case to Vermont because it is where she was located when her lawyers filed a habeas petition contesting her confinement.",
      "Ozturk's attorney on Monday also referenced a Washington Post report filed with the court, which cited internal memos indicating that the State Department found no evidence linking Ozturk to antisemitic activity or support for terrorism. Those underlying memos have not yet been produced in court. CBS News reached out to the State Department for comment.",
      "In a separate filing last week, Ozturk, 30, detailed how she was detained by ICE. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "\"I felt very scared and concerned as the men surrounded me and grabbed my phone from me,\" Ozturk said in the statement, writing that the officers told her they were police, and one quickly showed what might have been a gold badge. \"But I didn't think they were the police because I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this,\" she said.",
      "She added that the officers did not tell her why they were arresting her, and that they repeatedly denied her requests to speak to an attorney.",

    "summary": "President Trump's approvals on economy and inflation dip, as Wall Street has one of its most volatile weeks in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Amid a tumultuous week in the markets, the outlook on President Trump's trade and tariff policy hinges not just on what Americans think will happen, but when.",
      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",
      "Opinion is more mixed on how tariffs might impact U.S. manufacturing jobs: it is mostly Republicans who believe they will lead to more jobs.",
      "Trump's trade policies",
      "In all, more people say they like Trump's goals with tariff and trade policy than like his approach.",
      "And new tariffs continue to get net negative \u2014 but very partisan splits \u2014 in support.",
      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands.

    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",

      "\"It is very daunting when you think about the small number of people that have actually done it. I still get very uncomfortable when people say, 'astronaut,'\" King said. \"I in no means feel like an astronaut. They said, 'But, Gayle, if you go to space, you're an astronaut.'\"",
      "King said traveling to space was never her dream, but she considered the opportunity and message it would send.",
      "\"There was something about being part of the first female team to me,\" King said. \"The group of women that they put together is so extraordinary to me that I thought, 'Wow. Why would I not wanna be a part of that?'\"",
      "King, who turned 70 in December, said she never thought this experience would have been possible just 6 months ago.",

    "story": [
      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "Nate, an e-commerce company, launched the nate app that claimed to streamline the online shopping checkout process via a single AI-powered tap option. But the app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, according to the indictment.",
      "With the promise of custom-built \"deep learning models\" that would allow the app to directly purchase goods on product pages in fewer than three seconds, Saniger raised over $40 million. While instructing employees to keep nate's reliance on overseas workers secret, he pitched investors an AI-driven product capable of 10,000 daily transactions.",
      "Instead, the app allegedly relied heavily on overseas workers in two different countries who manually processed transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger, meanwhile, allegedly told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI.",
      "\"Saniger allegedly abused the integrity associated with his former position as the CEO to perpetuate a scheme filled with smoke and mirrors,\" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "In the technology's absence, Saniger allegedly relied heavily on hundreds of workers at a call center in the Philippines, court documents said. When a deadly tropical storm struck the country in October 2021, the indictment said, nate established a new call center in Romania to handle the backlog of customer services. Investors were likely never exposed to the lull in transactions because Saniger directed that transactions by investors be prioritized to avoid suspicion.",
      "The aftermath of the company's fallout in 2023, left investors with near-total losses, the indictment said.",
      "U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion last year\u00a0\u2014 and the U.N. trade and development arm said market share is poised to climb to $4.8 trillion by 2033.",

All 1.4 million clients on the island were without power, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press.",

      "Late Wednesday, Luma said \"a combination of factors\" led to the blackout, the latest in a string of major outages on the island in recent years \u2014 with the last major blackout occurring\u00a0less than five months ago on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Preliminary analysis points to a failure in the protection system as the initial trigger, followed by the presence of vegetation on a transmission line between Cambalache and Manat\u00ed,\" Luma said in an update. \"This sequence of failures triggered a chain of events that resulted in an island-wide outage.\"",
      "When will power in Puerto Rico turn back on?",

      "\"This is a total disaster,\" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.",
      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "\"Following today's island-wide power outage, our administration is actively engaged in ongoing communication with the White House and all relevant federal agencies,\" the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in a statement. \"We are working closely with the federal government to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the necessary support and that all essential services are restored as quickly and safely as possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday his state will file a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.",
      "The suit will argue Mr. Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China or a 10% tariff on all imports is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.",
      "The lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, will argue that enacting such tariffs requires approval from Congress, Newsom's office said in a news release.",
      "\"No other state will be more impacted by the impacts of this,\" Newsom said at a Wednesday press conference alongside California Attorney General Rob Bonta in the Central Valley.",
      "\"Already, vendors have warned us that they're going to pass the costs of Trump's tariffs onto the state of California,\" Bonta said.",
      "Bonta and Newsom noted that the lawsuit will be the 14th in less than 14 weeks that California has filed against the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're asking the court to rein in the president,\" Bonta said.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country. California's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration. The government briefly imposed steep \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries\u00a0last week, before pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days \u2014 but Mr. Trump left in place a 10% tariff on most imported goods, and hiked levies on imports from China to a total of 145%.",
      "Newsom said the tariffs have, in effect, resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage in California, which has the largest economy among the states and is a massive exporter of goods.",
      "\"No state is poised to lose more than the state of California,\" Newsom said.",
      "California's lawsuit makes it the first U.S. state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs. The state will ask the court to immediately block the tariffs.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:29:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung says the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",

      "The judge's ruling marks the most direct rebuke of the Trump administration amid its escalating tensions with the federal judiciary, which have particularly grown over challenges to the president's efforts surrounding immigration.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-used law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans who his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. Administration officials will also have the chance to suggest \"other methods\" of coming into compliance with the order, Boasberg wrote.",
      "White House communications director Steven Cheung said the administration will seek immediate relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "\"The president is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Boasberg, who sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., was overseeing a challenge brought by a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. The judge swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, after convening an emergency hearing, told government lawyers in-person that they should return people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed to El Salvador back to the U.S.",
      "A written order issued shortly after blocked the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities.",
      "But the judge said that despite his written and oral directives, the government did not stop the removal process, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the Alien Enemies Act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.",
      "The Trump administration's actions sparked questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order. The judge wrote in his opinion that \"boasts\" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele \"intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.\"",
      "Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and potentially live witness testimony under oath if needed.",
      "In the last hearing on the matter, a Justice Department attorney named two Department of Homeland Security officials and one State Department official as his points of contact after the judge's decision but said he did not know who directed the planes to continue their flights.",
      "Boasberg found that the Trump administration failed to dispel of any concerns that they violated his injunction, and during further proceedings, declined to \"admit to a grave mistake, explain how it transpired, and detail plans to rectify it.\"",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged Tren de Aragua members reached the Supreme Court late last month. The high court last week said that the Trump administration could resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants it claims are Tren de Aragua members under the law, but only if they are given due process.",
      "The high court also said that migrants challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act must seek judicial review through habeas petitions filed in the district where they are detained. As a result, the dispute before Boasberg in Washington, D.C., should instead be filed in Texas, where the Venezuelan migrants are confined, the Supreme Court said.",
      "Boasberg wrote that the Supreme Court's order \"does not affect \u2014 let alone moot \u2014 the compliance inquiry presently teed up here.\"",
      "The Trump administration invoked the state-secrets privilege in an effort to keep details out of Boasberg's reach in his efforts to find out more information about the two flights. But the judge found it is \"exceedingly doubtful that the privilege applies here\" because he was not asking about diplomatic agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, or the operational specifics of how the deportations were arranged.",
      "\"Instead, the court is simply seeking to confirm times and numbers: how many passengers the two flights carried, whether they were all deported pursuant to the proclamation, and when they were transferred out of U.S. custody,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The court is skeptical that such information rises to the level of a state secret.\"",
      "The judge also rejected the Trump administration's contentions that his order infringed on the president's authority, saying it merely restricted executive actions, which courts routinely do.",
      "\"It in no way invaded any Article II powers, despite defendants' effort to incant new ones into existence,\" he wrote. \"In any event, even if the TRO did somehow overstep the court's Article III power, defendants cannot now evade a contempt charge on that basis.\"",
      "Boasberg said that if the Trump administration and Justice Department do not prosecute his criminal contempt of court case, he will appoint someone who will.",

    "summary": "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act, a White House official confirmed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in the U.S. where endangered species live, a White House official confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The president has voiced frustration with the 1973 law and similar environmental protections, saying environmentalists are impeding growth. Real Clear Politics first reported Mr. Trump's plans to overhaul the law.",
      "A White House source was granted anonymity as the announcement is not official.",
      "It's not yet exactly clear how Mr. Trump would alter the use of the law, since only Congress can change or repeal it, but it would likely come through the federal rule-making process. The law was established to protect species of wildlife, fish and plants that have been depleted enough to be in danger of extinction.",
      "Last week, the president directed agencies regulating energy and the environment to sunset a number of environmental protections, among other steps to curb environmental protections to spur construction and economic growth.",
      "One step the administration is considering is to repeal the definition of 'harm,' which would remove nearly all habitat protections for endangered species across the country. Currently, if any business or activity harms a protected species, it's a violation of the law, as established by the ESA. The law defines \"harm\" as including \"any activity that can modify a species' habitat.\" Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to most species, since many aren't \"taken\" or killed to the point of extinction.. By eliminating this legal definition of \"harm,\" it would clear the way for many forms of economic development, including logging, oil and gas drilling, or critical mineral mining that could eradicate a species, environmentalists say.",
      "\"We'll go to court to fight as many of these rollbacks as possible,\" said Brett Hartl, director of government affairs for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The federal government is large and they're throwing everything at the wall hoping to overwhelm us, but we'll do our damnedest to make sure nothing becomes permanent.\"",
      "The Endangered Species Act was established in 1973 to protect \"various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the United States that had been rendered extinct as a consequence of economic growth and development untampered by adequate concern and conservation.\" By designating\u00a0 species with a protected status, this ensures that the ecosystems where the species live will be conserved and steps are taken to help support the species to avoid extinction. This, by extension, means that Congress and federal agencies will work with state and local governments to address water resources that impact species, as well as habitat.",
      "Critics of the Endangered Species Act claim the law goes far beyond the initial intent and is overly burdensome. Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, has frequently suggested changes to the ESA and last month proposed the Endangered Species Amendment Act of 2025. He said in a statement, \"The Endangered Species Act has consistently failed to achieve its intended goals and has been warped by decades of radical environmental litigation into a weapon instead of a tool.\"",
      "Much of what the Trump administration is proposing, by sunsetting regulations and overhauling the ESA, aligns with Westerman's bill.\"Environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan last year.",
      "Environmentalists, however, are concerned about weakening the law.",
      "\"This is a full-out assault on America's heritage,\" said Andrew Wetzler, the senior vice president of nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"If Trump is successful, it will turn the ESA into a shell of itself, and this would be open season for our most important wildlife.\"",
      "In the 50 years since the law was enacted, the ESA has been credited with saving 99% of the listed species. Notable species saved include the bald eagle, American alligators, whooping cranes and peregrine falcons.",
      "CBS News reported in 2023 that since the passage of the law, more than 1,7000 plants, mammals, fish, insects and other species in the U.S. have been listed as threatened or endangered. But federal data shows that of the roughly $1.2 billion a year spent on endangered and threatened species, about half goes toward recovery of just two types of fish: salmon and steelhead trout along the West Coast.",

Crew members on board a research vessel in the South Atlantic Ocean recorded the video March 9, said the nonprofit organization Schmidt Ocean Institute, which owns the ship.",
      "The crew's remotely operated vehicle technically facilitated the sighting, which occurred about 2,000 feet below the surface of waters around the South Sandwich Islands, a volcanic archipelago located between the tip of South America and Antarctica. The unprecedented footage of the elusive deep-sea creature  came 100 years after it was initially identified and given a name, according to the institute.",
      "As their moniker suggests, colossal squid can grow to be enormous, with some ultimately weighing as much as 1,100 pounds and measuring up to 43 feet, according to the conservation group Oceana. That's the height of a multi-story building. The squid caught on video in the South Atlantic was a juvenile and much smaller than a full-grown adult, with the research team placing its size at around 11 feet long.",
      "\"It's exciting to see the first in situ footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,\" said Kat Bolstad, a professor and researcher at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, who the crew consulted to verify their squid footage after the expedition. \"For 100 years, we have mainly encountered them as prey remains in whale and seabird stomachs and as predators of harvested toothfish.\"",
      "The expedition occurred during a 35-day voyage where researchers sought to find new marine life, according to the Schmidt Ocean Institute.",

      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there.

Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",

      "Washington \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday that the Justice Department is filing a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education for \"discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women's sports\" in what she alleged is a violation of Title IX.",
      "\"The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,\" Bondi said. \"This is about sports, this is also about these young womens' personal safety.\"",
      "The move marks an escalation between the Trump administration and Maine over the issue. President Trump signed an executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity, mandating that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. President Trump said states not in compliance would jeopardize any federal funding they receive.",
      "Then, in a tense moment between Mr. Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, later in February, the president threatened that her state wouldn't get federal funding if it didn't comply with the executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on women's sports teams. Mills replied, \"See you in court.\"",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who appeared alongside Bondi on Wednesday, said \"I hope Gov. Mills will recognize that her political feud with the president will deprive the students in her state of much more than the right to fair sporting events.\"",
      "The attorney general outlined that the Justice Department had \"exhausted every other remedy,\" saying it has \"repeatedly notified Maine of its infractions and urged them to remedy the situation to protect women.\" Bondi noted that the administration has stripped grants to Maine through other agencies, and would \"continue to fight for women.\"",
      "The federal government said in its lawsuit filed in Maine's federal court that the state's Department of Education is \"openly and defiantly flouting anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,\" arguing that the practice violates Title IX's \"core protections.\"\u2028It cited three examples of boys participating in girls sports.",

      "Mills pledged to \"vigorously defend our state against the action announced today from the Department of Justice\" in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the fight isn't about women's sports, but \"states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will.\"",

    "summary": "Massachusetts investigators uncover a suspicious web history after Brian Fanion reports his wife Amy's death as a suicide.",
    "story": [
      "When Massachusetts State Police detectives responded to a reported suicide in Westfield, Massachusetts, on May 8, 2018, they found Amy Fanion dead on her dining room floor with a gunshot wound to her head. Her husband, Brian Fanion, a Westfield Police detective, had called 911, reporting that Amy Fanion had shot herself.",
      "At the scene, detectives made several discoveries that raised questions. The gun used in the shooting was Brian Fanion's service weapon. And there was a lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head, which was unusual in a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What had happened in that dining room that morning? \"48 Hours\" contributor Nikki Battiste takes a look at the evidence in an encore of \u00a0\"The Detective's Wife\"\u00a0airing Saturday, April 19 on CBS and streaming on Paramount +.",
      "Detective Brendan O'Toole took Brian Fanion to the State Police barracks in Russell, Massachusetts, to get his statement of the events surrounding his wife's sudden death. At the end of the interview, \u00a0O'Toole asked Fanion to turn over his phone for data extraction. Fanion complied but gave a caveat.",
      "\"I turned off the recorder and that's when Brian told me \u2026 'you're going to see some things on there and it's not what it appears to be,'\" O'Toole told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Investigators would discover thousands of deleted text messages between Brian Fanion and a woman named Corrine Knowles, known as Cori. Brian Fanion had told O'Toole he and Knowles were just friends, but the text messages conveyed that the relationship had become something more.",
      "On May 17, three days after Amy Fanion's wake, O'Toole and Detective Mike Blanchette confronted Brian Fanion about his relationship with Knowles as well as the lack of gunshot residue found on Amy Fanion's wound.",
      "\"I mean, there's no doubt she was shot \u2026 but the question is, from what distance,\" O'Toole asked Fanion.",
      "Within a week, investigators seized all of Fanion's electronics, including his office computer and laptop at the Westfield Police Department. When Detective Tom Forest from the Cyber Crime Unit examined the computer's hard drive, it revealed peculiar web searches and online activity he considered notable to the investigation. The online activity began about three months before Amy Fanion's death, around the time Brian Fanion and Knowles' friendship turned flirtatious.",
      "\"\u2026 it's only when this affair starts up \u2026 that all of these incriminating searches start to appear,\" Hampden County Assistant District Attorney Mary Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The first of these inquiries was related to common household poisons. On the morning of Feb. 12, Brian Fanion searched \"household poisons,\" \"dangerous sources of radiation,\" \"worst sources of radiation\" and \"common prescription overdoses.\" He also visited web pages titled, \"9 Surprising Sources of Radiation in Your Home;\" \"Carbon Monoxide: The Invisible Killer;\" \"Common and dangerous poisons;\" \"16 Common Household Items That Could Kill You;\" \"What Over-the-Counter Medications Can You Overdose From?;\" \"Which Drug Causes the Most Deaths Each Year?\" and, finally, \"Prescription Drugs Linked to Most Fatal Overdoses.\"",
      "At trial, Brian Fanion's defense attorney Jeffrey Brown argued that the Fanions were preparing to have a young niece stay with them and that some of the websites were related to potential hazards their 200-year-old house might pose.",
      "At the beginning of March 2018, Fanion repeatedly Googled his potential lover, Cori Knowles. On April 2, as things heated up between Fanion and Knowles, he began questioning the nuances of affairs, searching \"can you have an affair without sex.\"",
      "Two weeks later, on April 17, Fanion began researching divorce laws in Massachusetts. Several web pages he visited were related to pension rights after divorce. Fanion was planning for his upcoming retirement, and according to Knowles in an interview with police, he feared losing part of his pension if he were to divorce his wife. The following day, Brian Fanion's inquiries into infidelity resumed, visiting web pages titled \"My perfect affair \u2013 how I'm getting away with it\" and \"Emotional Infidelity: Worse Than A Sexual Affair?\"",
      "Eleven days before Amy Fanion died, on April 27, Brian Fanion searched \"gsr testing\" on his work computer. That morning between 9:22 and 9:38 a.m., Brian Fanion visited five web pages related to gunshot residue. Among those web pages were \"Gunshot Residue Collection: The Decisions that Make or Break a Case\" and a news report on YouTube called \"What gunshot residue tests tell us.\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours\" this had nothing to do with Brian Fanion's work at the Westfield Police Department.",
      "\"He wasn't assigned to any active investigations in April and May of 2018 \u2026 that would necessitate looking up gunshot residue,\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\" \"Nobody in the Westfield Police Department does gunshot residue testing.\"",
      "On May 7, 2018, the day before Amy Fanion was shot dead, Fanion repeatedly searched how to remove frequent contacts from his phone. At his trial, Fanion's defense argued that he was in the process of getting a new phone and wanted to know how to erase data from his current one. Sandstrom prosecuted the case.",
      "\"Now, the defendant suggests that he did these searches because he's in the process of getting a new phone right before his wife's demise,\" Sandstrom told the jury. \"But he's not looking to delete all data off of his phone \u2026 he's searching how to delete the frequently contacted list because he doesn't want evidence of his relationship with Corrine being discovered by the state police.\"",
      "Fanion's trial for the murder of Amy Fanion began on Feb. 23, 2023. Sandstrom's first witness was Amy Fanion's sister, Anna Hansen. Hansen testified that after Amy's death, Brian Fanion confided that he was concerned about some searches he had made.",
      "\"I asked him what that search was, and he said how to make a murder look like a suicide,\" Hansen said on the witness stand. Under cross examination by the defense, Detective Tom Forest testified that he never found any searches related to those terms.",
      "On the morning of May 8, 2018, while Brian Fanion was still at work, he searched \"massachusetts medical examiner offices\" and visited a website that listed the units within the Massachusetts State Police forensics section.",
      "In her closing arguments, Sandstrom stated that that morning, Brian Fanion was preparing for his wife's murder. \"He's looking up and researching the units that will appear \u2026 after he's committed this murder. \u2026 the evidence in this case proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was going to murder Amy Fanion when he left the Westfield Police Department at 11:47 a.m. on May 8th.\"",
      "Brian Fanion's defense argued that Amy Fanion had anger issues and suffered from severe anxiety. After Amy's death, many members of her family signed a letter in support of Brian, stating that they were certain Amy had taken her own life. Several members of Amy Fanion's family took the stand, and although they were called as witnesses for the prosecution, their testimonies supported Brian Fanion's defense.",
      "After a month-long trial, the jury found Brian Fanion guilty of the first-degree murder of Amy Fanion. He was sentenced to life in prison. His conviction is under appeal.",

    "summary": "A federal judge found that the White House likely violated the First Amendment when it restricted the AP's access to press events based on its refusal to use the name Gulf of America.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Associated Press said its reporters were prevented from attending an Oval Office event with President Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele even though a federal judge had ordered the White House to restore the news outlet's access as of Monday.",
      "An AP spokesperson said in a statement that its \"journalists were blocked from the Oval Office\" on Monday despite the order requiring the White House to rescind its restrictions on the AP's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other places where space is limited when they're open to other members of the White House press pool.",
      "The AP also reported that one of its reporters was not allowed to attend an event on the South Lawn of the White House recognizing the Ohio State University's championship football team that was open to credentialed media, though two AP photographers were permitted to cover it.",
      "A White House official separately confirmed Tuesday night that the White House is changing the makeup of the press pool, which is the small group of rotating journalists who cover the president each day, to remove a spot designated for news wire services like the AP. The official said the pool will instead consist of a second print journalist, and wire reporters will be eligible for the pool's daily print journalist position.",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in response to the changes that the wire services \u2014 the AP, Bloomberg News and Reuters \u2014 play a crucial role in coverage of the presidency and should have their traditional spot in the press pool.",
      "\"The changes to the press pool today show that the White House is \u00a0just using a new means to do the same thing: retaliate against news organizations for coverage the White House doesn't like,\" he said. \"The WHCA is working to find out what this means in practice but what we do know is that restrictions on White House media coverage only hurt the American people who rely on unfiltered journalism to stay informed and make decisions critical to their lives.\"",
      "Daniels said the White House's insistence that they will maintain discretion over the composition of the pool, instead of using regular rotations, \"underscores that the administration remains unwilling to provide guarantees they will not continue to engage in the viewpoint discrimination that was ruled unlawful by a federal court.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled last week that the White House cannot deny AP journalists access to spaces made available to the pool or events open to all credentialed members of the White House press corps because of its refusal to use the name Gulf of America in its Stylebook and reporting. McFadden, who was appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump in his first term, put his order on hold until Monday.",
      "The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of three judges is set to consider Thursday whether to grant the administration's request to pause the district court's decision \u2014 which would reinstate the restrictions on the AP \u2014 while it considers the appeal.",
      "The AP spokesperson said in the statement that the outlet expects \"the White House to restore AP's participation in the pool as of [Monday], as provided in the injunction order.\" The White House did not return a request for comment.",
      "The AP, which says its news reporting reaches roughly 4 billion people daily, filed its lawsuit against three senior White House officials after it was informed in February that it would no longer be allowed in places like the Oval Office and on Air Force One as part of the press pool until the AP revised its influential Stylebook to use the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico.",
      "The Stylebook is a writing and editing guide that is used by newspapers, magazines and other media outlets throughout the country. It covers a wide range of topics, from abbreviations of state names to describing ages to jargon used in different sports.",
      "In addition to being denied admittance to the press pool, AP reporters have also been turned away from larger events open to the broader White House press corps, the outlet said in court papers.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order renaming the body of water in January. But the AP said it would not update its Stylebook, which is used in newsrooms worldwide, to reflect the change because the president's directive only carries authority within the U.S. The AP said that as an international news agency, it \"must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "McFadden last week said that the White House likely violated the First Amendment when it excluded the AP from press events because of its refusal to change the Gulf of Mexico's name in its Stylebook.",
      "The judge stressed that he is not ordering the Trump administration to grant the AP permanent access to the Oval Office, East Room or other media events, and noted that the AP is not entitled to the permanent press pool access it previously enjoyed.",
      "But McFadden wrote that the AP \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" he wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "As a news wire service, the AP is a regular participant in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds.",
      "One iteration of the press pool, which attends most White House events in the Oval Office and other small spaces, has 21 members. The smallest iteration, which travels with the president aboard Air Force One, has 13 members. The AP typically had two of the 13 core spots in the press pool.",

      "The toddler was reported missing just before 5 p.m. Monday, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said on social media. A missing person poster shared by the sheriff's office identified the toddler as Boden Allen and said he was last seen wearing a tank top and pajama pants.",
      "Boden had wandered off from his home in Seligman, Arizona, a remote town with a population of less than 1,000 people, the sheriff's office said.",
      "A wide search was immediately begun, including 40 search and rescue team members, several deputies from the Yavapai and Coconino County Sheriff's Offices, and members of the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The search continued overnight. A Department of Public Safety ranger rescue helicopter crew said they spotted two mountain lions in the area, the sheriff's office said. Temperatures in the county ranged between the high 40s and low 50s overnight, weather history site timeanddate.com said.",

      "\"I'd heard about the missing child before I was going to town, and when I was driving out the driveway I noticed my dog was sitting down by the entrance,\" said the rancher in an interview with the sheriff's office. CBS affiliate KPHO\u00a0identified him as Scotty Dunton. \"I look up, and there's a little kid standing there with my dog.\"",
      "Dunton said his home is about seven miles from the toddler's house, separated by rough terrain including \"three big mountain ranges\" and \"big valleys.\" He speculated that Boden walked down a clear-cut path under a power line, but still \"can't believe the kid made it that far.\" The sheriff's office confirmed the distance between Boden and Dunton's homes.",
      "Dunton said he brought Boden inside, and gave him something to eat and drink. He asked the toddler if he had walked all night. The boy said he had slept under a tree. Dunton believes the tree is in his horse pasture. Dunton then said he asked Boden if his dog, an Anatolian Pyrenees named Buford, found him. The boy said yes, Dunton said.",
      "Buford is a \"guardian dog\" who patrols within a half mile of the house at night and keeps coyotes away from the property, Dunton said. He told the sheriff's office that he believes Buford came upon the toddler and protected him while bringing him to safety.",
      "\"It's what he does. He loves kids, so I can imagine he wouldn't leave him when he found him,\" Dunton said. \"It was a relief that he was alive. I was ecstatic that he was OK and that my dog found him.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday said she will prevent the Trump administration from enforcing portions of an executive order that targets the law firm Susman Godfrey, finding that the directive likely retaliates against the firm and its clients for their exercise of constitutionally protected speech.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan granted the firm's request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing and said Susman Godfrey is likely to succeed on its claims that the executive order, signed by President Trump last week, violates the First and Fifth Amendments. She specifically blocked the administration from enforcing provisions relating to federal contracting and restricting Susman employees' access to federal buildings and from engaging with government workers.",
      "AliKhan said while delivering her ruling from the bench that the government \"sought to use its immense power to dictate the positions that law firms may or may not take,\" which threatens the foundation of legal representation in the U.S. She said the executive order is \"based on a personal vendetta\" against Susman Godfrey.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" AliKhan, who sits on the federal district court in Washington, D.C., said.",
      "Following the hearing, the firm said in a statement it is grateful to the court for addressing the unconstitutionality of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"This fight is bigger and more important than any one firm. Susman Godfrey is fighting this unconstitutional executive order because it infringes on the rights of all Americans and the rule of law. This fight is right, it is just, and we are duty-bound to pursue it,\" it said.",
      "Susman Godfrey is the fourth law firm to succeed in the early stages of lawsuits that challenge executive orders signed by Mr. Trump. The orders, signed over the past few weeks, each threaten the firms with sanctions because of their legal work, as well as lawyers who are currently or were previously on their payrolls.",
      "Susman Godfrey represented Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation lawsuit filed against Fox News over baseless claims it aired about the 2020 election, which Mr. Trump falsely claims was rigged against him. The case ended with a $787 million settlement agreement before the start of the trial. The firm is also representing Dominion in a defamation case against Newsmax, a conservative television network. A jury trial in that dispute is slated to begin at the end of the month.",
      "During the hearing, Donald Verrilli, who is representing Susman Godfrey, called Mr. Trump's executive order \"one of the most brazenly unconstitutional exercises of executive power in the history of this nation.\" He told the court it \"runs roughshod\" over the separation of powers.",
      "Pointing to other law firms that have reached deals with the White House, likely to head-off being targeted by Mr. Trump, Verrilli said they have done so to \"stay on the president's good side.\" Those nine firms have agreed to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono work to causes backed by the president.",
      "\"We're sliding very fast into an abyss,\" Verrilli said. \"There's only one way to stop that slide: for courts to act decisively and act decisively now.\"",

      "Xinis said Tuesday that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm,\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery, or fact finding, in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him.",
      "\"I've gotten nothing, I've gotten no real response [from the government],\" Xinis said, calling the Justice Department's arguments thus far \"two misguided ships passing in the night.\"",
      "Xinis responded to the Justice Department's suggestions that the back and forth is simply a legal dispute, and that there is \"so much daylight between what you keep saying and what the posture of the case is.\"",
      "\"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before she rules on whether to hold the government in contempt of her order, Xinis said.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's filings this week citing the exchange between President Trump and Bukele, in which Bukele said he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the United States, Xinis said that \"if that were in a court of law \u2014 it would have real infirmities in a trial, in a court of law.\"",
      "\"No press release is going to move the court the same way that sworn, under oath testimony from persons with knowledge,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis had ordered the Justice Department to provide her with answers to three questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and efforts to bring him back to the U.S. after the Supreme Court last week\u00a0affirmed a portion of an earlier order that required the U.S. to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued in a filing that the Trump administration defied the district court and Supreme Court orders by refusing to provide \"even basic information\" about their client's location and what it is doing to follow the directive to return him to the U.S. They asked Xinis to provide three types of relief, including ordering the government to explain why it shouldn't be held in contempt for failure to comply with her prior rulings.",
      "During a hearing Friday, after the high court released its decision, Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, repeatedly said he could not provide information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. Xinis said in a written order after the proceedings that the Trump administration \"failed to comply\" with her directive and \"made no meaningful effort to\" obey it.\u00a0 She ordered the government to provide daily updates to the court about Abrego Garcia's location and custodial status, as well as the efforts taken by the administration to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the court Saturday, Michael Kozak, a senior State Department official, said Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, in El Salvador.",
      "\"He is alive and secure in that facility,\" Kozak wrote. \"He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In another declaration filed Sunday, Evan Katz, assistant director for the Removal Division at ICE, said the administration had no updates for the court beyond what had already been shared. The latest filing, submitted Monday from Mazzara said the agency \"does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have been defiant in their response to Xinis' order that they take steps to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and have argued that their obligations are limited only to removing \"any domestic obstacles\" that would impede his ability to return to the U.S., where he has lived since arriving unlawfully in 2011.",
      "Federal courts, they said in a filing Sunday, are powerless \"to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities in March and flown to El Salvador with more than 200 other migrants who are now confined at CECOT. His lawyers have argued that his removal to El Salvador was unlawful, as an immigration judge in 2019 granted him a withholding of removal, a legal status that forbids the Department of Homeland Security from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is likely to face persecution from local gangs.",
      "Numerous Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security \u2014 including Solicitor General John Sauer \u2014 have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Savaldor was an \"administrative error\" because he was granted withholding of removal.",
      "But Katz, the ICE official, said in his declaration that Abergo Garcia is no longer eligible for that relief because of his alleged membership in the gang MS-13, which President Trump designated as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "While the Department of Homeland Security has claimed that Abrego Garcia has ties to MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant, his lawyers argue that he is not a member of MS-13 or any other gang. They have also said he has never been charged or convicted of any crimes in the U.S., El Salvador or any other country.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case landed before the Supreme Court last week after Xinis issued an order on April 4 that directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return by 11:59 p.m. on April 7.",
      "The Justice Department appealed, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary order pausing that deadline to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant the Trump administration's request to block Xinis' order.",
      "The high court on Thursday upheld part of the decision that required the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody, but said the district court should clarify its directive that the Trump administration \"effectuate\" his return.",
      "Xinis moved swiftly in responding, and issued a new order requiring the Trump administration to take all available steps to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have claimed that it is up to the Salvadoran government to decide if they want to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. But during a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he does not \"have the power\" to do so.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\"he said in response to questions from reporters. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.",

      "A man accused of trying to assassinate President Trump at his Florida golf club last September can hire an expert to examine the rifle recovered from the scene, but only to determine its operability, a federal judge said Tuesday.",
      "Ryan Routh's attorneys had asked that their expert be allowed to inspect, photograph and test the rifle in order to evaluate a government expert's findings, as well as test it for other information that they thought was relevant. In Tuesday's order, District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2014 who was nominated by Mr. Trump \u2014 limited the testing to just its operability, with a May 15 deadline.",
      "Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with attempted assassination of a presidential candidate and two firearm charges. His federal trial is scheduled for September, and he's expected to face additional state charges.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump \u2014 then a presidential candidate \u2014 for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. Before the president came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions. He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged last week\u00a0Routh also tried to buy an anti-aircraft weapon online to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane. \"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh allegedly told an associate from whom he hoped to buy the weapon.",

    "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:51:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested Monday at a citizenship interview in Vermont \u2014 one day after telling CBS News he'd \"accept the outcome.\"",
    "story": [
      "Just one day before Mohsen Mahdawi was detained by immigration agents at what he was told was his citizenship interview, the Columbia student and Palestinian activist told CBS News he thought there was a chance the long-awaited appointment could be a trap.",
      "\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mahdawi \u2014 a native of the Israeli-occupied West Bank who has held a green card for the last decade \u2014 told CBS News on the eve of his detention. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute. Is this a honey trap?\"",
      "Mahdawi was taken into custody after arriving at his interview in Vermont on Monday. CBS News witnessed federal agents strapping on vests shortly after he walked into the building, emerging about an hour later with Mahdawi in handcuffs.",
      "His attorneys say he was detained under a little-used law allowing foreign nationals to be deported if they pose \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" \u2014 making him the latest student to face detention, including fellow Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi's legal team has petitioned a judge to release him and alleged he is being punished for protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment and his right to due process.",
      "Shortly after Mahdawi's detention, federal Judge William Sessions ordered the Trump administration not to deport him or move him out of the state of Vermont while Sessions reviews the case, granting a request from Mahdawi's attorneys.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment to the State Department, which declined to comment.",
      "Mahdawi \u2014 who says he was set to receive his bachelor's degree in philosophy in May \u2014 co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023 along with Khalil. Mahdawi was later active in protests on Columbia's campus against Israel's war in Gaza, which began after Hamas' terrorist attack launched from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023. His attorneys said in a court filing that Mahdawi \"took a step back\" from organizing the protests in March 2024, before the protests escalated later that spring, with demonstrators forming encampments and occupying a campus building.",
      "The nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests was a political lightning rod, with critics arguing the demonstrations \u2014 and their leaders \u2014 were disruptive and featured antisemitic rhetoric. Columbia is one of several schools to face a freeze in federal funding by the Trump administration, which alleges the Ivy League school \"failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\"",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News last weekend he faced \"threats\" and \"intimidation\" after speaking about the protests in a late 2023 \"60 Minutes\" interview. Shortly after President Trump took office, he also drew the attention of Betar USA, a controversial pro-Israel group that tweeted in January that Mahdawi was on its \"deport list.\"",
      "The group's former Executive Director Ross Glick told CBS News that Betar USA has collected information on thousands of pro-Palestinian activists and passed it on to the Trump administration. He said it's up to the government to decide whether somebody actually supports Hamas: \"Once information is handed off, we're out of the process, right? It's ultimately up to the government, the various officials.\"",
      "Mahdawi pushed back on Betar's criticism, saying groups like Betar \"manipulate information, create lies, and attach them to the profiles of those either students or activists.\" Mahdawi has vehemently denied claims of antisemitism in the Columbia University protests more generally, calling them a \"false accusation.\"",
      "He also told CBS News over the weekend that if he's detained by federal agents, \"I want people to know that my compassion extended beyond the Palestinian people. My compassion is also for the Jewish people and for the Israelis as well.\"",
      "After Khalil was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month, Mahdawi feared he could be ensnared next. Khalil is currently held in Louisiana, and his legal future is uncertain: An immigration judge ruled last week the Trump administration can move forward with deportation but gave his lawyers until late April to file applications for relief. His lawyers have indicated they will appeal the ruling, and they are separately suing the government for his release.",
      "Mahdawi told CBS News he began taking precautions for his own safety, including avoiding public spaces, after Khalil's detention. Still, when he received word of a citizenship appointment, he chose to attend \u2014 though he suspected it may lead to his detention.",
      "\"It's an irony. The irony of destiny. And I accept the outcome,\" Mahdawi said a day beforehand. \"If my story will become another story for the struggle to have justice and democracy in this country, let it be.\"",

      "All hospitals on the island are operating on generators after the power went out at 12:38 p.m. Eastern Time, Veronica Ferraiuoli, acting governor and secretary of state for Puerto Rico, said at a news conference. All 1.4 million clients on the island were without power, Hugo Sorrentini, spokesman for Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The entire island is without generation,\" he said.",
      "Why is Puerto Rico without power?",
      "The source of the outage was in the southern part of the island where a transmission line was affected, according to Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n, executive director of Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority.",
      "Late Wednesday, Luma said \"a combination of factors\" led to the blackout, the latest in a string of major outages on the island in recent years \u2014 with the last major blackout occurring\u00a0less than five months ago on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Preliminary analysis points to a failure in the protection system as the initial trigger, followed by the presence of vegetation on a transmission line between Cambalache and Manat\u00ed,\" Luma said in an update. \"This sequence of failures triggered a chain of events that resulted in an island-wide outage.\"",
      "When will power in Puerto Rico turn back on?",
      "Restoring most of the power will likely at least 48-72 hours, Luma said Wednesday evening. At least 78,000 customers were also without water, according to the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority.",

      "\"This is a total disaster,\" said Orlando Huertas, 68, as he sipped a drink with a friend at a streetside bar and criticized the government for not doing enough to tackle the chronic outages.",
      "Dozens of people were forced to walk next to the rails of the rapid transit system that serves the capital, San Juan, while scores of businesses including the biggest mall in the Caribbean were forced to close. Professional baseball and basketball games were cancelled as the hum of generators and smell of smoke filled the air.",
      "\"Following today's island-wide power outage, our administration is actively engaged in ongoing communication with the White House and all relevant federal agencies,\" the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration said in a statement. \"We are working closely with the federal government to ensure that Puerto Rico receives the necessary support and that all essential services are restored as quickly and safely as possible.\"",
      "By late Wednesday afternoon, some 5,000 to 7,000 clients had their power restored, although that number is expected to fluctuate. Those without generators crowded around grocery stores and other businesses to buy ice.",
      "\"I'm desperate. My generator is broken,\" said Carmen Suriel, who worried about the impact of the blackout on her two children, a six-month-old and a five-year-old with Down syndrome, as the temperature rose across Puerto Rico on Wednesday.",

      "\"They have to improve,\" she said of the government. \"Those who are affected are us, the poor.\"",
      "The island of 3.2 million residents has a more than 40% poverty rate, and not everyone can afford solar panels or generators. While there was a push to use more renewable energy sources under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, which\u00a0provided Puerto Rico with mega generators\u00a0and other resources, experts worry that won't happen under U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Puerto Rico has struggled with chronic outages since September 2017 when Hurricane Maria pummeled the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing a power grid that crews are still struggling to rebuild. As the island was just starting to rebuild, it was hit hard again by Hurricane Fiona in 2022.",
      "The grid already had been deteriorating as a result of decades of a lack of maintenance and investment.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma, a private Canadian-American company based in San Juan, to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",

      "Abrego Garcia was arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) in March as he was leaving his job in Baltimore, Maryland and returning home to Prince George's County. On March 15, he was deported to El Salvador on a plane with more than 200 other migrants that the Trump administration claims had gang affiliations.",
      "ICE later admitted that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an \"administrative error,\" however, they did not take action to return him to the U.S.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to MS-13",
      "The Trump administration has said that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his attorney and family deny. He also has no criminal history in any country.",
      "\"The case of Abrego Garcia does not have to do with MS-13,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but they have not found that. In fact, recently, a U.S. federal court judge said that the Trump administration did not have evidence to support the claim that he had ever been part of MS-13.\"",
      "Why can't El Salvador return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.?",
      "During his update in El Salvador, Sen. Van Hollen questioned why Abrego Garcia is still being held at CECOT and asked if the government has any evidence of Abrego Garcia's gang ties.",
      "\"The government of El Salvador has no evidence that he is part of MS-13, so why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CECOT?\" the senator questioned.",
      "According to Van Hollen, the vice president said the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia at CECOT.",
      "When asked again why El Salvador could not release Abrego Garcia, Vice President Ulloa referred to a statement that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele gave while visiting the White House, saying the country cannot smuggle Abrego Garcia back into the U.S."

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:29:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled the country's 2010 Equality Act defines a woman as someone born biologically female in a potential landmark case for transgender rights.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a potential landmark decision, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that in a 2010 civil rights law called the Equality Act, the word \"woman\" refers to someone's biological sex.",
      "The five judges on the court stressed that their ruling was limited to interpreting the 2010 law as it pertains to women, and that \"it is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word 'woman' other than when it is used in the provisions of\" that legislation.",
      "What the U.K. Supreme Court said about the definition of \"woman\"",
      "Monday's ruling was in response to a series of challenges brought by the campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS). The group initially challenged the definition of the term \"woman\" as included in Scottish legislation from 2018, which set targets to increase the proportion of women serving on public bodies.",
      "That legislation, for its own purposes, initially defined the term \"woman\" as including people \"(i) with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment; (ii) living as a woman; and (iii) proposing to undergo / undergoing / who have undergone a gender reassignment process,\" Monday's Supreme Court judgement said.",
      "FWS challenged that definition and subsequent statutory guidance was issued amending the definition of a \"woman\" under the Scottish law to bring it in line with the U.K.-wide Equality Act of 2010, which included people with Gender Recognition Certificates. Those government-issued GRCs allow a person's affirmed gender to be legally recognized in the U.K.",
      "That further guidance was appealed by FWS, however, and the case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which ruled Wednesday that \"the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,\" though the court stressed that the definition was solely for the purpose of interpreting the specific part of the legislation in question.",
      "\"The questions raised by this appeal directly affect women and members of the trans community,\" the Supreme Court said. \"On the one hand, women have historically suffered from discrimination in our society and since 1975 have been given statutory protection against discrimination on the ground of sex. On the other hand, the trans community is both historically and currently a vulnerable community which Parliament has more recently sought to protect by statutory provision.\"",
      "\"It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex, nor is it to define the meaning of the word 'woman' other than when it is used in the provisions of the EA 2010,\" the judges said.",
      "The Supreme Court said using a wider definition of \"woman\" under the Equality Act could have created confusion among those trying to use the law to protect women and trans people from discrimination.",
      "\"Gender reassignment and sex are separate bases for discrimination and inequality,\" the judgement said.",
      "It explained that in the court's view, including trans people with a GRC certificate under the category of \"woman,\" for the purposes of interpreting the Equality Act, \"would create two sub-groups within those who share the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, giving trans persons who possess a GRC greater rights than those who do not. Those seeking to perform their obligations under the Act would have no obvious means of distinguishing between the two sub-groups to whom different duties were owed.\"",
      "Responses to the U.K. Supreme Court's judgement",
      "The ruling by the U.K. Supreme Court comes at the same time as efforts by the Trump administration in the United States to to\u00a0prohibit\u00a0gender-affirming care for minors and\u00a0bar trans people\u00a0from serving in the U.S. military or participating\u00a0in women's sports.",
      "Activist Grahame Park Girl told Britain's Press Association news service on Monday that the court's judgement was \"the only common sense decision you can make. Anything else would be farcical and appalling for women's rights.\"",
      "J.K. Rowling, who has campaigned for the primacy of biological sex, celebrated the judgement on social media.",
      "\"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.,\" Rowling said.",
      "LGBTQ+ rights group Stonewall said it would work with partners to understand the implications of Monday's ruling for trans people, and cautioned against anyone attempting to interpret it too broadly.",
      "\"Stonewall shares the deep concern at the widespread implications for today's ruling from the Supreme Court. It will be incredibly worrying for the trans community and all of us who support them,\" Stonewall CEO Simon Blake said in a statement.",
      "\"It's important to be reminded the Court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on Gender Reassignment, and will continue to do so,\" Blake said.",
      "\"We are really shocked by today's Supreme Court decision \u2014 which reverses twenty years of understanding on how the law recognizes trans men and women with Gender Recognition Certificates,\" the rights group Scottish Trans said in a statement. \"The judgement seems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guantanamo-trump-migrants-without-criminal-records/",
    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:08:01 -0400",
    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Centers as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",

      "Israel's government had not confirmed the new offer to Hamas as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had sought shelter in sprawling tent camps around the Kuwaiti Field Hospital, but the wounded from Tuesday's strike were all patients and medics, including two patients who were left in critical condition, according to hospital spokesman Saber Mohammed.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces on the Tuesday strike. The IDF has bombed hospitals on several occasions during the 18-month war, accusing Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel, of hiding out in them or using them for military purposes. Hamas and Gazan hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians and deliberately gutting the territory's health system.",
      "On Sunday, Israel struck the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City after ordering an evacuation. The United Nations said a child patient with a reported head injury died while being evacuated, and the strike severely damaged the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings.",
      "Al Ahli Hospital \"is out of service,\" Director-General of the U.N.'s World Health Program Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet, adding: \"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected. The aid blockade must be lifted. Ceasefire.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman echoed that sentiment, saying: \"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the hospital, also condemned the strike.",
      "Israel said it targeted a Hamas command and control center within the facility, without providing evidence. Hamas denied the allegations.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 51,000 people, according to an updated toll released by the Gaza Ministry of Health on Tuesday. That includes more than 1,600 people killed since Israel ended the ceasefire and resumed its offensive last month to pressure Hamas to accept changes to the agreement. The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to Gaza's Hamas-run government. Its casualty count is seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers. Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants but says women and children make up more than half of the dead. The offensive has destroyed much of the territory and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza. Israeli officials say 59 of those hostages remain in Gaza, 24 of whom are still believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

      "The order to stop accepting Boeing jets comes after China boosted its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports, although those taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products.

      "Boeing is scheduled to ship about 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, including China Southern Airlines, Air China and Xiamen Airlines, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Aviation Flights Group.

    "story": [
      "A Russian court on Tuesday convicted four journalists of extremism for working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny and sentenced each to 5 1/2 years in prison.",
      "Antonina Favorskaya, Kostantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger were found guilty of involvement with a group that had been labeled as extremist. All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists.",
      "The closed-door trial was part of an unrelenting crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country.",
      "Favorskaya and Kriger worked with SotaVision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organizations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for Western media outlets, including The Associated Press.",
      "The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption, which was designated as extremist and outlawed in 2021 in a move widely seen as politically motivated.",
      "Navalny was President Vladimir Putin's fiercest and most prominent foe and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalny died in February 2024 in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence on a number of charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven.",
      "Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she did on abuse Navalny faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants' cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping organize Navalny's funeral.",
      "Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution failed to prove them.",
      "\"I understand perfectly well ... what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,\" Gabov said in the statement. \"Independent journalism is equated to extremism.\"",
      "In a statement Karelin prepared for his closing arguments that also was published by Novaya Gazeta, he said he had agreed to do street interviews for Popular Politics, a YouTube channel founded by Navalny's associates, while trying to provide for his wife and a young child. He stressed that the channel wasn't outlawed as extremist and had done nothing illegal.",
      "\"Remorse is considered to be a mitigating circumstance. It's the criminals who need to have remorse for what they did. But I am in prison for my work, for the honest and impartial attitude to journalism, FOR THE LOVE for my family and country,\" he wrote in a separate speech for court that also was published by the outlet, in which he emphasized his feelings in capital letters.",
      "Kriger, in a closing statement published by SotaVision, said he was imprisoned and added to the Russian financial intelligence's registry of extremists and terrorists \"only because I have conscientiously carried out my professional duties as an honest, incorruptible and independent journalist for 4 1/2 years.\"",
      "\"Don't despair guys, sooner or later it will end and those who delivered the sentence will go behind bars,\" Kriger said after the verdict.",
      "Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict.",
      "The Russian human rights group Memorial designated all four as political prisoners, among more than 900 others held in the country. That number includes Mikhail Kriger, Artyom Kriger's uncle, a Moscow-based activist who was arrested in 2022 and is serving a seven-year prison sentence.",
      "Mikhail Kriger was convicted of justifying terrorism and inciting hatred over Facebook comments in which he expressed a desire \"to hang\" Putin.",
      "The four journalists are not the only people linked to Navalny who have faced charges from the Russian legal system. In January , three lawyers who had defended Navalny were convicted of participating in an \"extremist organization\" and sentenced to prison. The lawyers had helped transmit Navalny's prison statements to the world before his death. Vadim Kobzev, the most high-profile member of the team, was given a 5 1/2 year sentence. Alexey Lipster was sentenced to five years, and Igor Sergunin was sentenced to 3 1/2 years.",
      "In July 2024, five months after Navalny's death was reported, Russia\u00a0issued an arrest warrant for his wife,\u00a0Yulia Navalnaya. The country accused Navalnaya of participating in an \"extremist organization.\" Navalnaya, who lives in Germany and was named the chairperson of the Human Rights Foundation in July 2024, derided the decision on social media.",

    "summary": "A trove of buried treasure that metal detectorists recently discovered in Transylvania once belonged to an ancient people that inhabited the region in modern-day Romania.",
    "story": [
      "Two men with metal detectors recently discovered a trove of ancient treasure in Transylvania, which shed new light on early settlements in the storied historical region, local officials said. Encompassing much of present-day Romania, Transylvania is known for its medieval towns, Gothic architecture and vampiric folklore, with a mythical reputation tied to the fictional character Dracula and his real-life inspiration, the notorious 15th-century ruler Vlad the Impaler.",
      "The treasure unearthed this spring in the Transylvanian town of Breaza dates back much farther than the brutal monarch's reign. In an announcement shared last week, officials in Breaza said the metal detectorists found jewelry that originally belonged to Dacian people, who inhabited what is now Transylvania and some of its surrounding areas from around the 1st century B.C.E. until the 1st century of the common era. Dacia was eventually conquered by the Roman Empire.",
      "Silver brooches and a bracelet decorated with plant motifs were among the artifacts discovered, in addition to a chain necklace and a belt constructed out of circular metallic pendants, each marked with solar symbols. The treasure weighed 550 grams altogether, officials said, equating to more a pound.",
      "The Mures County Museum, near Breaza, confirmed the jewelry's origins in ancient Dacian society. An archaeologist at the museum, Daniel Ciota, will study the treasure as it is prepared for display.",
      "Officials in Breaza said the silver pieces were likely worn by a Dacian aristocrat, citing its lavishness as a signal of its owner's status, potentially as a \"high-ranking\" member of their society. As for why the jewels were ultimately buried in the ground, the officials suggested they could have been used as offerings to some unknown deity long ago. However, they also acknowledged someone may have hidden them for more personal reasons.",
      "There were no previous records of Dacian settlements in this part of Transylvania, and the treasure is the first physical evidence off Dacian people living around Breaza. Moving forward, officials said archaeologists and researchers will begin to explore the area in hopes of finding remnants of a settlement where the owner of the jewels may have lived.",
      "\"These historical artifacts remind us of the cultural heritage and importance of our region in the history of Dacia,\" the town of Breaza wrote in a social media post unveiling the treasure. \"This discovery honors and encourages us to proudly protect and promote our heritage.\"",

      "A Mexican artist was forced to flee a concert stage on Saturday after enraging fans by saying he had been banned by the government from singing popular songs glorifying drug traffickers.",
      "\"Narcocorridos\" are a controversial sub-genre of music in Mexico, which celebrates the exploits of the country's infamous drug cartels.",
      "The songs have caught the attention of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who in recent days launched a music contest \"for peace and against addictions,\" seeking to counter the popularity of narcocorridos among young people in Mexico and the United States.",
      "Chaos erupted early Saturday in the city of Texcoco, 15 miles outside Mexico City, when Luis R. Conriquez told the crowd that he could not sing his popular songs praising leaders of the Sinaloa cartel.",
      "Media reports and online videos show the singer explaining to the audience that the government had banned him from singing the songs.",
      "\"It's a law that must be respected... I also feel bad for not singing what you want to hear,\" Conriquez said in the videos.",
      "Booing soon escalated into objects and beer being thrown at the singer and his band, who were forced to flee the stage. Later, nearly 20 people stormed the stage, destroying musical instruments and sound equipment.",
      "Conriquez's manager, Freddy Perez, said in a post on Instagram that the artist obeyed the government's order \"not to sing corridos.\"",
      "The situation \"led to a violent attack on our artist, band and crew... People reacted very badly, destroying instruments and audio equipment,\" he added.",
      "The state government confirmed the incident in a statement, saying there were no injuries. It urged against \"condoning violence, referring to figures linked to criminal acts or drug use\" at public events.",
      "Narcocorridos are banned at public events in states including Nayarit, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Quintana Roo. The genre has flourished on digital platforms, its popularity boosted by the rags-to-riches stories in the songs.",

      "Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration,\u00a0said late Tuesday on social media\u00a0that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of\u00a0Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes\u00a0layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to\u00a0train cartel recruits\u00a0and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes. The U.S. government has offered a\u00a0$15 million reward\u00a0for information leading to Oseguera's capture. In November, his son-in-law was\u00a0arrested in California\u00a0after U.S. officials say he faked his own death to \"live a life of luxury\" north of the border.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been\u00a0designated\u00a0as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison.",
      "In December, videos posted on social media from a town in the western state of Michoacan, showed a sign at a Christmas fair\u00a0thanking the Jalisco cartel's leader\u00a0for the gifts.",
      "\"The children of Coalcoman thank Mr. Nemesio Oseguera and his sons, 2, 3, and Delta 1, for their noble gesture. Thank for your gifts,\" the sign read.",

    "story": [
      "Russian missiles struck the heart of the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy as people were gathering to celebrate Palm Sunday. At least 34 people were killed in the second large-scale attack in Ukraine to claim civilian lives in just over a week.",
      "Officials said two ballistic missiles hit around 10:15 a.m. local time. Images from the scene showed lines of black body bags on the side of the road while more bodies were seen wrapped in foil blankets among the debris.",
      "The dead included two children, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. Some 117 people were wounded, including 15 children.",
      "\"Only filthy scum can act like this \u2014 taking the lives of ordinary people,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. In a statement on social media, he said the first strike hit buildings belonging to a city university, while the second exploded above street level.",
      "The head of the Ukrainian president's office, Andriy Yermak, said the strike also used cluster munitions in an attempt to kill as many people as possible. The Associated Press was unable to verify the claim.",
      "Other world leaders also condemned the attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that it undermined Washington-led peace talks between the sides.",
      "\"Everyone knows: This war was initiated by Russia alone. And today, it is clear that Russia alone chooses to continue it \u2014 with blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts\" of Mr. Trump, Macron wrote in a statement.",
      "Asked about the attack, Mr. Trump said late Sunday evening that he was trying to get the war stopped.",
      "\"I think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing,\" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington. He did not clarify whether he was saying the attack on Sumy was unintentional.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had offered his condolences earlier to the victims of the \"horrifying Russian missile attack on Sumy.\"",

      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said the Sumy attack crossed \"any line of decency\" and that the White House remained committed to ending the conflict.",
      "\"There are scores of civilian dead and wounded. As a former military leader, I understand targeting, and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,\" he said.",
      "The attack on Sumy followed a deadly April 4 missile strike\u00a0on Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih\u00a0that killed at least 19 people, including nine children.",
      "Zelenskyy called for a global response to the attack.",
      "\"Talks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What's needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,\" he said.",

      "The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said a Russian strike hit one of the city's kindergartens, shattering windows and damaging the building's facade. No casualties were reported.",
      "The strikes come a day after Russia and Ukraine's senior diplomats accused each other of violating a tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the three-year war.",
      "The two countries' foreign ministers spoke at separate events at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum a day after\u00a0U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff\u00a0met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss peace prospects.",

    "story": [
      "A pre-dawn Israeli airstrike hit a hospital in northern Gaza early Sunday, forcing patients to quickly evacuate after staff said they had received a warning only 20 minutes before the attack.",
      "The strike hit Al-Ahili hospital in Gaza City. One patient, a girl, died during the evacuation because medical staff were unable to provide urgent care, the Hamas-run ministry of health said.",
      "The health facility, one of the few functioning hospitals in Gaza City, is run by the Diocese of Jerusalem, which condemned the attack.",
      "In a statement, the diocese said twin strikes damaged several buildings including the pharmacy and emergency departments.",
      "\"A mere twenty minutes prior to the attack, the Israeli army ordered all patients, employees and displaced people to immediately evacuate the hospital premises prior to its bombing,\" the statement said. \"We thank God that there were no injuries or deaths as a result of the bombing.\"",

      "\"We call upon all governments and people of goodwill to intervene to stop all kinds of attacks on medical and humanitarian institutions,\" it said. \"We pray and call for the end of this horrific war and the suffering of so many.\"",
      "The director of Al-Ahli Hospital, Dr. Fadel Naim, said in a post on X that the damage to the hospital will impact more than 100 patients and dozens of medical staff.",
      "Images of the aftermath showed the hospital's caved-in cement roof, surrounded by debris. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, the health ministry's director general called the evacuation frightening, with people carried out into the streets in hospital beds.",
      "\"It was very scary for the patients ... we did not know what happened,\" he said. The health ministry said patients have since been transferred to three other hospitals in Gaza City, including Shifa, Al-Quds and the Kuwait Field Hospital.",
      "Israel said it struck a command and control center used by Hamas at the hospital to plan and execute attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, without providing evidence. It said before the strike, steps were taken to mitigate harm, including issuing warnings and using precise munitions and aerial surveillance.",
      "Hours later, a separate strike on a car in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, killed at least seven people \u2014 six brothers and their friend \u2014 according to staff at the morgue of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies.",
      "The Israeli military also said they targeted another command and control center in Deir al-Balah when many Hamas militants were present and planning to attack Israeli soldiers. This was not connected to the strike on the car in the same area, which the army said it was looking into.",
      "The strikes came hours after Israel's defense minister said that military activity would rapidly expand across Gaza and that people would have to evacuate from \"fighting zones.\" Israel also announced Saturday the completion of the Morag corridor, cutting off the southern city of Rafah from the rest of Gaza, with the military saying it would soon expand \"vigorously\" in most of the small coastal territory.",
      "Israel is demanding that Hamas release 59 remaining hostages, of whom 24 are believed to be alive, and accept proposed new ceasefire terms.",
      "In the last 24 hours, the Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry said that 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its 18-month campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding them, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes while accusing Hamas of using them as cover for its fighters.",
      "The war started after Hamas killed 1,200 people during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, mostly civilians, and took 250 people captive, some of whom were eventually freed in ceasefire deals. At least 41 hostages have died in captivity.",
      "More than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have so far been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive, according to the health ministry there, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",

      "Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations\u00a0next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Iranian state TV also said U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi \"briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister\" at the end of the talks, marking a direct interaction between the two nations locked in decades of tensions.",
      "The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location on the outskirts of Oman, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local.",
      "The White House said Witkoff was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima for the talks, which it described to be \"very positive and constructive.\"",
      "\"Special Envoy Witkoff underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations' differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,\" the White House said Saturday in a statement. \"These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening that the talks with Iran are \"going okay\" but declined to give further details.",
      "\"Nothing matters until you get it done,\" he said.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman",
      "AP journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the \"indirect talks\" had begun.",
      "\"These talks will be held at a location planned by the Omani host, with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States seated in the halls and sides, conveying their points of view and positions to each other through the Omani Foreign Minister,\" Baghaei wrote.",
      "About an hour later, Baghaei appeared on Iranian state television and acknowledged the talks had been going on all that time.",
      "\"The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear \u2014 we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran's national interests,\" he said. \"We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions.\"",
      "Baghaei added: \"Look, this is just a beginning. So it is natural that, at this stage, both sides will present their foundational positions through the Omani mediator. Therefore, we do not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.\"",
      "Araghchi earlier spoke to Iranian journalists.",
      "\"If there is sufficient will on both sides, we will decide on a timetable. But it is still too early to talk about that,\" Araghchi said, in an audio clip published by IRNA. \"What is clear now is that the negotiations are indirect, and in our view only on the nuclear issue, and will be conducted with the necessary will to reach an agreement that is on an equal footing and leads to securing the national interests of the Iranian people.\"",
      "Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being \"direct.\"",
      "\"I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,\" Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. \"That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.\"",
      "He added: \"Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\"",
      "Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues",
      "While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.",
      "One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution \u2014 \"you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution\" \u2014 unworkable.",

      "\"Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for heart disease that is largely determined by genetics.\"",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say.",

      "\"There is no approved pharmacotherapy for lipoprotein(a) by regulatory authorities in any country in the world,\" Nissen confirmed.",
      "Study design",
      "The researchers performed a clinical trial of 320 individuals from Argentina, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the U.S. from Nov. 11, 2022, to April 17, 2023.",
      "The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one or two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran.",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The normal level of Lp(a) is less than 75 nanomoles per liter and the average level for people in the trial was about 250 nanomoles per liter, Nissen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"They were very high \u2014 more than three times the upper limit of normal,\" he added.",
      "WHEN MEASURING HEART ATTACK RISK, ONE IMPORTANT RED FLAG IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DOCTORS SAY",
      "After one injection of the highest dose, participants showed a nearly 100% reduction in levels of lipoprotein(a) at six months.",
      "Those who received a second dose at six months maintained an almost 100% reduction at the one-year mark.",
      "In other words, the therapy removed virtually all lipoprotein(a) from the blood, according to Nissen.",
      "Unlike traditional cholesterol, which doctors typically monitor over time, lipoprotein(a) only needs to be checked once in a lifetime. (iStock)",

      "(To address this concern, the researchers are enrolling many more Black patients in their larger phase 3 clinical trial.)",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Another limitation was that only two doses of lepodisiran were administered in the trial, so the effect of more doses is not known.",

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The LSC breach isn\u2019t just another headline. It\u2019s a serious reminder of how exposed we really are. When personal, medical and financial information is stolen, the consequences are immediate and long term. Identity theft, fraudulent transactions and misuse of health data are all very real risks. If your information may have been affected, act now. Review your records, freeze your credit and be vigilant.",

      "Critical Windows 10 security flaws exploited",
      "The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices.",
      "The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements.",
      "The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features.",
      "For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk.",

The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now.",
      "However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.",
      "This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It\u2019s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually.",
      "The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some. Analysts warn this could contribute to a surge in electronic waste, unless recycling and repurposing efforts improve dramatically.",

Strong antivirus software can act as a second line of defense, detecting and neutralizing malware that exploits vulnerabilities before they cause harm. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats. While this won\u2019t fix unpatched system flaws after October 2025, it can reduce risks from common attack vectors like phishing or malicious downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

      "Picture this: A dairy barn full of cows being milked, fed and cleaned up after, but there\u2019s no farmer in sight. Sounds a bit unusual, right? Well, it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might think. Thanks to cutting-edge agricultural robotics, this kind of scene is becoming more common. At this farm, a team of autonomous robots is taking care of all the essential chores, completely changing the way dairy farming works.",
      "These robots aren\u2019t just doing the heavy lifting; they\u2019re creating a stress-free, comfortable environment for the cows while keeping things efficient and sustainable.",

      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of robotic dairy farms",
      "In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production.",
      "Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide.",

      "Traditional dairy farms rely heavily on human labor for repetitive daily tasks, which can take up about a third of a farmer's workday. These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

      "The introduction of milking machines in the early 1900s and rural electrification in the 1950s significantly increased farm size and milk production. Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming. Wearable technology and smart sensors are also becoming increasingly important tools in herd health monitoring, offering farmers real-time insights into cow well-being and productivity.",

      "Cows are curious animals and tend to interact with robots. Lely has had to cow-proof its robots to ensure they can function autonomously around cows. This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",

      "Lely is working to integrate its robots seamlessly into the daily lives of dairy farmers, who are increasingly becoming robot managers. This requires farmers to manage the robots and learn how to interpret the data they generate. The additional time and flexibility afforded by robots have allowed some dairy farmers to diversify their operations. One Lely customer, for example, has added a restaurant and farm shop to his dairy, allowing patrons to observe the robots at work while enjoying cheese made from the cows they care for.",

      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Flexibility and sustainability",
      "Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before.

      "Kawasaki's CORLEO is a hydrogen-powered, AI-driven rideable robot. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on this new way of thinking about off-road transportation.",
      "What if your next off-road ride wasn\u2019t on a motorcycle or ATV but on a robot that moves like a wolf? Kawasaki Heavy Industries has introduced something that feels straight out of a video game: CORLEO, a hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot prototype designed to be ridden by humans. Unveiled at the Osaka-Kansai Expo 2025, this futuristic machine is built to handle rugged terrain with ease, combining cutting-edge robotics and sustainable energy.",
      "Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes CORLEO so cutting-edge.",

      "Hydrogen-powered, four-legged robot concept (Kawasaki Heavy Industries) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A new way to explore the outdoors",
      "CORLEO isn\u2019t your typical off-road vehicle. Instead of wheels, it has four robotic legs that move independently, allowing it to handle uneven ground like rocks, grass and steep inclines. Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly.",
      "CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery. Kawasaki has been pushing hydrogen-powered vehicles for years, and CORLEO is their latest effort to combine sustainability with innovation.",

      "What makes CORLEO special?",
      "CORLEO isn\u2019t just about getting from point A to point B. It\u2019s packed with advanced features that make it feel like something out of the future.",
      "AI-powered navigation: The robot uses artificial intelligence to stay balanced and adapt its movements in real time. Whether you\u2019re on rocky trails or steep hills, CORLEO adjusts to keep you stable.Body movement control: No buttons or levers here. CORLEO responds directly to how you shift your weight. It\u2019s designed to feel natural and intuitive, even for beginners.Heads-up display: A small screen gives you all the info you need while riding, like how much hydrogen fuel is left, navigation tips and even details about weight distribution.Slip-resistant hooves: Instead of wheels, each leg ends in rubber hooves that grip different surfaces securely. This makes it perfect for exploring areas where traditional vehicles might struggle.",

      "Right now, CORLEO is still in the prototype phase, so there are some unanswered questions, like how fast it can go or how far it can travel on a full tank of hydrogen. And while the idea of riding a robotic wolf sounds amazing, we\u2019ll have to wait a while before it becomes available. Kawasaki estimates it could take up to 25 years before something like CORLEO hits the market.",
      "Still, this concept shows where off-road vehicles could be headed in the future. Kawasaki sees CORLEO as an alternative to traditional motorcycles or ATVs, something that could make exploring tough terrains safer, easier and more sustainable.",

      "All Windows PCs come with a built-in security feature called Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), which helps prevent unauthorized software from running by allowing only trusted applications.",
      "However, despite its purpose, hackers have discovered several ways to bypass WDAC, exposing systems to malware, ransomware and other cyber threats.",
      "As a result, what was once considered a strong layer of defense may now serve as a potential vulnerability if not properly managed.",

      "What is Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) bypass?",
      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To find and fix these security gaps, Microsoft runs a bug bounty program that rewards researchers for reporting vulnerabilities in WDAC and other security components. However, some bypass techniques go unpatched for long periods.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "How hackers bypass Windows Defender Application Control",
      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",

      "3 ways you can protect your PC from WDAC hackers",
      "Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk.",
      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",
      "2. Be cautious with software downloads:\u00a0Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.",
      "However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.",
      "So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) offers a valuable layer of security, it isn\u2019t foolproof. Hackers are actively developing and using WDAC bypass techniques to exploit gaps in system defenses. Understanding how WDAC bypass works is essential to protecting your devices. By keeping your software up to date, using trusted applications, and relying on reputable security tools, you can significantly lower your risk.",

      "A life turned upside down",
      "At just 13, Clara began experiencing uncontrollable seizures that baffled doctors. Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn\u2019t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication.",
      "\"Every night I would have seizures, up to 10, and it was just miserable,\" Clara said, recalling the years lost to her condition.",
      "Her adolescence was marked by sleepless nights and constant medical challenges, robbing her of the simple joys of being a teenager. For years, there seemed to be no solution in sight.",

      "A revolutionary solution",
      "Everything changed this past summer when Clara became the first pediatric patient to undergo a minimally invasive procedure at the Mayo Clinic using NeuroOne's cutting-edge brain implant technology. The device, known as the\u00a0NeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure.",
      "\"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life.",
      "Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara\u2019s case in more detail:",
      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "HOW ELON MUSK\u2019S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS",
      "How NeuroOne\u2019s dual-function system works",
      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.",
      "On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump\u2019s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans \u2014 both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\"",
      "The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas\u2019s ability to control the population.",
      "On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor \u2014 which separates Rafah from Khan Younis \u2014 is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas\u2019s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said.",
      "IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops.

Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages \u2014 that is the only way to stop the war.\"",
      "In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\"",
      "Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\"",
      "CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY",

      "Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\"",
      "While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\"",
      "On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas\u2019s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It\u2019s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\"",

      "Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N.

No medicine. Gaza is a killing field \u2014 and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General\u2019s claims. \"As always, you don\u2019t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip \u2014 over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you \u2014 they\u2019re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)",
      "Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn\u2019t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza \u2014 this was admitted by the UN\u2019s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid.

      "Trump\u2019s actions are a sweeping departure from a voluntary norm upheld by Republican and Democratic presidents since the Watergate scandal. It emerged after President Richard Nixon was found to have improperly used Justice Department investigations, lawsuits and subpoenas to punish or discredit his rivals.",
      "President Gerald Ford and his successors agreed that the president would decide the broad law enforcement and legal priorities of the Justice Department. But the attorney general and DOJ prosecutors would determine which individuals and organizations to investigate based on the facts and the laws involved.",
      "That norm was never enshrined in law, and legal experts and former Justice Department officials say Trump has moved swiftly to undermine it in his first three months back in office.",
      "\u201cIf these measures don\u2019t destroy the independence of DOJ, they certainly undermine it severely,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a libertarian legal scholar at George Mason University and the Cato Institute. \u201cWorse, by targeting the president\u2019s political opponents for investigation... they threaten freedom of speech and perhaps other civil liberties.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re sliding very fast into an abyss here,\u201d said Verrilli, who was solicitor general in the Obama administration.",
      "On the same day last week that Trump issued the executive order against Susman Godfrey,\u00a0he signed a presidential memorandum directing Bondi to review the conduct of Chris Krebs when he was a top cybersecurity official in Trump\u2019s first term. Following the 2020 election, Trump fired Krebs after he contradicted Trump\u2019s false claim that the race was stolen from him.",
      "Trump also signed a presidential memorandum that directed the\u00a0homeland security secretary to review the activities of Miles Taylor as a government employee. Taylor wrote an anonymous memoir that criticized Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents and other conduct during his first term.",

      "\"That's great,\" Trump replied.",
      "Trump\u2019s effort to punish Susman Godfrey followed previous executive orders targeting multiple other law firms. Trump also issued a presidential memorandum last month that authorized the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to sanction law firms that file lawsuits they deem \u201cfrivolous.\u201d",
      "It directed Bondi to recommend penalties, including terminating law firms\u2019 federal contracts and the federal contracts of their clients, as well as revoking attorneys' ability to have security clearances or enter federal buildings. Steve Bannon, a close ally of Trump, said the goal was to force the firms out of business.",
      "Fearing the loss of large numbers of clients, multiple law firms have reached settlements with Trump that require them to provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal representation to causes that Trump backs. Susman Godfrey and several other firms have gone to court and asked judges to declare Trump's actions illegal.",

      "Former aides to Garland have said he took great pains to distance himself from the White House and Biden, especially after Garland appointed special counsels to investigate Trump, Biden and Hunter Biden.\u00a0Garland, they added, also intentionally minimized his public and private interactions with Biden.",
      "Stephen Gillers, an expert on legal ethics at New York University Law School, said that Trump, not Biden, has violated norms. Gillers noted that the executive orders and memorandums issued by Trump leave every step of the process \u2014 defining an individual's or organization's possible offense, deciding whether they are guilty and inflicting a punishment \u2014 controlled by Trump and his aides.",

    "story": [
      "Bowen Yang is in a splashy new movie, \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d but he also has some serious thoughts about his high-profile role playing Vice President JD Vance on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "While discussing the new film, in theaters Friday, about a man who gets caught up in a sham marriage between his boyfriend and his best girlfriend over a green card and in vitro fertilization, Yang reflected on his identity as a gay Asian American and how it affects his work playing Vance.",
      "Though fans have praised his depiction of the vice president, he said it\u2019s been difficult for him \u2014 but that he\u2019s put forth the same effort as with any role.",
      "\u201cI approached it in as disciplined of a way as I think anyone could, which was I hired, I worked with this accent coach that I love, where we found the right balance between, like, Appalachian and Ohio,\u201d Yang told NBC News. \u201cI have a serviceable JD Vance, but I was like you know what, this is a charge that I don\u2019t take lightly. Like, I want to make it pop as best as I can. I\u2019ve been very lucky to play political figures on that show.\u201d",
      "Yang, the first Asian American and one of the few openly LGBTQ+ cast members in the 50-year history of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d said his beliefs and identity affect his work.",
      "In the end, Yang said he\u2019s \u201cchecked every box,\u201d but he thinks the role of Vance overall leaves a lot to be desired.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s just such a tragic figure in terms of American history,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it just doesn\u2019t have the give that you want it to. And that\u2019s OK.\u201d",
      "He said portraying major figures in a climate where identity and politics are so divisive can feel like a no-win situation.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no universal agreement on what something funny is, on what humor is,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just going to be alienating no matter what.\u201d",
      "He also joked on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d that he asked \u201cSNL\u201d creator Lorne Michaels to not make him do the part.",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d and NBC News share the same parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "In \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d Yang plays Chris, a birdwatcher in a five-year relationship with his wealthy Korean boyfriend, Min (Han Gi-chan). As Min\u2019s U.S. visa is set to expire, Chris reluctantly agrees to facilitate Min\u2019s pretend-marriage with his best friend Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) so Min can stay in the country and pay for Angela and her partner Lee\u2019s (Lily Gladstone) next round of IVF.",
      "But then his grandma plans an over-the-top Korean wedding banquet.",
      "The movie is a remake of Ang Lee\u2019s 1993 film of the same name, a rare portrayal of a queer Asian American at the time. Yang said that the original film resonated with his experience in college, after his parents sent him to conversion therapy in his teens.",
      "\u201cI was back in the closet with my family, and the original film fades out on this uncertainty with the parents,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey still hug and they still embrace, but it hangs on that uncertainty, and I felt like that was where I was at in life at the time. It gave me this blueprint, or it still gives me this extrapolating point to sort of work towards that \u2014 that if I can get there, then I\u2019ll be OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a much better place,\" Yang said. \"There are still obviously things that cannot fully be known in a mutual way. But I give them a lot of grace for just meeting me where I\u2019m at, because that is not something I ever expected.\u201d",
      "Director and co-screenwriter Andrew Ahn said writing, casting Yang and filming the movie was \u201cwish fulfillment.\u201d",
      "\u201cChris, as a character, is so much this amalgamation of my boyfriend and my group of friends, and so it just made sense,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cI was like, I want to cast a friend, you know?\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Ahn said the film was his way of creating the family he wants for himself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to say that within my friend group, my desire to have children feels radical. \u2026 I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s in my future,\" Ahn said. \"I tragically told my boyfriend, \u2018It\u2019s OK if we don\u2019t have kids, like maybe I\u2019ll just make movies about families.\u2019\u201d"

      "Colleges across the country are facing battles with the federal government over funding, but similar cuts and the potential elimination of the Education Department may be existential for historically Black colleges and universities, according to at least six college administrators and leaders who spoke with NBC News.",
      "Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University\u2019s (FAMU) college of pharmacy lost a $16.3 million federal grant in late March, as the Trump administration has threatened cuts at American colleges over diversity, equity and inclusion on campus. The moves are causing several Black colleges to consider what their budgets may look like with less or no federal funding.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at this position where we realize that our ancestors did not rely on federal money in order to get the work done,\u201d said Fatima Brunson, an assistant professor for education at Spelman College, a private women\u2019s HBCU in Atlanta with about 2,600 students.",
      "Still, for the 100 or so HBCUs in the country \u2014\u00a0some of which were underfunded by more than $12 billion over the last 30 years compared with non-HBCUs, according to a 2022 Forbes analysis \u2014 federal cuts may translate to staff cuts, fewer students and the elimination of certain programs, according to two HBCU administrators who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of their universities.",
      "One of the HBCU leaders described a shared \u201cculture of concern\u201d across Black colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents and others at these institutions are getting a steady and really unmistakable message that they are the enemies of the Trump administration at all levels,\u201d the HBCU leader said. \u201cIf there is a hiccup there, then we are going to get a stomach ulcer.\u201d",
      "Fifty-four percent of Black colleges\u2019 total revenue depends on federal and state funds, compared with just one-third for other colleges and universities, making them \u201csusceptible to economic downturns, state divestments from higher education, or policy changes,\u201d the authors of a 2019 report by the United Negro College Fund wrote.",
      "The dilemma has fueled angst at these institutions \u2014 where, on average, 3 in 4 students also receive need-based federal aid \u2014 about who will have access to financial resources and benefits and who won\u2019t. Seventy-three percent of HBCU students receive Pell Grants, the low-income federal student aid program, which were traditionally issued by the Education Department, compared with 36% of non-HBCU students, according to the United Negro College Fund.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Madi Biedermann, the Education Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for communications, said the department will not be shutting down immediately, and that federally mandated programs have not been moved out of the Education Department as of now.",
      "\u201cAs President Trump and Secretary McMahon have made clear, sunsetting the Department of Education will be done in partnership with Congress and national and state leaders to ensure all statutorily required programs are managed responsibly and where they best serve students and families,\u201d Biedermann said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Valerie Kinloch, who became president of Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, less than two years ago, expected challenges in her position. She did not anticipate having to weather the eventual dismantling of the Education Department or preparing to reimagine university life without federal funds.",
      "\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are.\u201d",
      "Kinloch\u2019s predicament mirrors what many Black colleges and universities are experiencing as they brace for potential staffing cuts and reduced student enrollment as the Education Department heads toward being shuttered by the Trump administration.",
      "To make up for a potential shortfall, her university launched a $10 million fundraising initiative to match the amount of federal aid it receives.",
      "Kinloch noted that while some financial responsibilities for colleges also fall to states, she is concerned about the future of federal programs like Upward Bound, which helps first-generation college students and is backed by the Education Department.",
      "Grant funding for critical health and science research, including several ongoing projects that address housing and health care inequalities \u201cthat can transform lives,\u201d she said, may also be in danger due to cuts.",
      "Black colleges contribute roughly $15 billion to their local economies in addition to tens of thousands of jobs, according to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.",
      "For example, FAMU\u2019s lost $16.3 million federal grant supported new faculty hires and funded research into artificial intelligence and cancer biology, including colorectal cancer disparities in Black Americans. The school is now appealing the decision to the National Institutes of Health, an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "No further cuts have come down yet, but Charles Weatherford, vice president for research at FAMU, said that \u201cthe loss of funding from the Department of Education could potentially impact funds that have been used to support graduate students and academic departmental innovation.\u00a0 Less funding opportunities would impact the types of financial support available to students to further their higher education aspirations.\u201d",
      "With cuts, new federal restrictions and confusion looming over colleges, some HBCU leaders say their colleges are exploring what life without government funding would look like \u2014 while acknowledging that not every campus has that privilege.",
      "More than 300,000 students attend about 100 accredited HBCUs across 19 states, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "North Carolina A&T, the biggest HBCU, has the largest endowment of all Black public colleges, with $202 million in its coffers. Howard University, a private school in Washington, D.C., recently became the first Black college to have a $1 billion endowment.",
      "\u201cAs an institution and HBCU, Spelman College has positioned themselves to feel pretty confident that we\u2019re OK,\u201d said Spelman\u2019s Brunson. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the same\u201d for each HBCU.",
      "Eighteen Black colleges, including Howard, were among the 30 most reliant on federal funds for their operating revenues, according to 2023 federal education data.",
      "Hassiem Kambui, an education professor at a public HBCU and author of \u201cAfricentric Education: Public Schools Versus Charter Schools,\u201d said he sees this time of evolution for Black colleges as a moment to reinvest in self-preservation.",
      "\u201cThis is an opportunity to look at ourselves as educators and evaluate how we are moving on education, focusing on change and the lessons we can learn associated with how American students are served given those allocated funds,\u201d Kambui said.",
      "President Donald Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from colleges that don\u2019t rid their curriculums and offices of DEI-related materials and practices, even investigating 45 universities that have partnered with The PhD Project, which aims to diversify faculties at business schools. While no HBCUs are among those listed, HBCU leaders anticipate that it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "By banning DEI practices in the federal government and putting pressure on private companies to do the same, Trump has prophesied, \u201cOur country will be woke no longer.\u201d This comes as HBCUs are experiencing record enrollment numbers following the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision to strike down affirmative action programs and race-based admissions at predominantly white institutions.",
      "In February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture briefly suspended its 1890 scholars program, an initiative at 19 HBCUs that covers the full tuition of selected agricultural studies students. The program was restored four days later, and the federal government did not explain why it had been initially suspended.",
      "Many HBCU leaders see consistent roadblocks for Black schools as evidence of a coordinated strategy at the highest levels of the country to undermine their existence.",
      "Brunson, said she sees this moment as an opportunity to reset.",
      "\u201cEducation is under attack and it\u2019s just something that we\u2019re kind of in the trenches with,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s making us go back to the deeper philosophical reason for why we are here in the first place.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK \u2014 A former New York police sergeant was sentenced Wednesday to 18 months in prison in a U.S. case about China\u2019s pursuit of critics abroad, a sentence that came after two members of Congress urged the judge to spare him from time behind bars.",
      "Michael McMahon was convicted in 2023 of contributing to a transcontinental pressure campaign aimed at getting a former Chinese city official to leave the U.S. and return to his homeland. The tactics ranged from Facebook messages to a threatening real-world note on the man\u2019s New Jersey door.",
      "During an hourslong sentencing, McMahon said he was \u201cunwittingly used\u201d by Chinese operatives when he took what he thought was a routine private investigation job in 2016.",
      "\u201cI never thought for one minute I was working for China, stalking anyone. Yet now I\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cThis is such a nightmare.\u201d",
      "He was among 10 people charged in the federal case, which spurred the first trial stemming from U.S. claims about China\u2019s decade-old \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d initiative. Beijing says it\u2019s about bringing corrupt officials and other criminal fugitives to justice; Washington deems it an exercise in threatening and harassing dissidents across borders.",
      "U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen said McMahon aided \u201ca campaign of transnational repression \u201c that harmed the targeted man, his family and the United States.",
      "\u201cThis type of crime really does threaten our country\u2019s national security,\u201d Chen said. She said the retired New York Police Department officer ignored clear trouble signs when he agreed in 2016 to help find a man named Xu Jin.",
      "Xu, a former official in the city of Wuhan, left China in 2010. Authorities there have accused Xu and his wife of bribery, which they deny. Xu\u2019s wife testified that he was unjustly targeted for rankling the Chinese power structure.",
      "China doesn\u2019t have an extradition treaty with the U.S., so China couldn\u2019t legally force Xu\u2019s return. But he was repeatedly and insidiously pressed to return.",
      "At one point, his octogenarian father was abruptly flown in from China to press him to go back, according to trial evidence. Later, a threatening note was taped to his door telling him to go to prison in China to ensure his family\u2019s well-being.",
      "Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement Thursday that the ex-officer \u201cwent rogue and dishonorably engaged in a scheme at the direction of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d China denies threatening people to make them return.",
      "Through his lawyer, McMahon acknowledged searching law enforcement and government databases and conducting surveillance to gather information on Xu. But the former officer maintained he was told the investigation was for a Chinese construction company hoping to recover embezzled money.",
      "McMahon and his attorney, Lawrence Lustberg, acknowledged Thursday that the investigator missed \u201cred flags.\u201d But his clients deceived him, he didn\u2019t anticipate the things they did to badger Xu, and he wouldn\u2019t have taken the $11,000 job if he had known about China\u2019s alleged involvement, Lustberg insisted, calling McMahon a patriot.",
      "The claim of transnational repression \u201chorrifies him as much as anybody,\u201d Lustberg said.",
      "McMahon, 57, shook his head as the details of his conviction \u2014 on charges including acting as an illegal foreign agent and stalking \u2014 were recounted. At other points, he wiped his eyes, particularly when his attorney mentioned the death last week of one of McMahon\u2019s eight siblings.",
      "Dozens of his relatives and friends filled benches in the courthouse, and some yelled \u201cshame on you!\u201d and similar remarks at prosecutors as they left the court.",
      "McMahon himself declined to comment. He\u2019s due to report to prison in June, though the date may be extended.",
      "His lawyer said the judge issued \u201ca thoughtful sentence,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s always tragic when someone who\u2019s innocent, and I do think he\u2019s innocent, is sentenced to prison.\u201d",
      "Five people charged in the case remain at large, believed to be in China. Three others pleaded guilty, and co-defendants Zheng Congying and Zhu Yong were convicted alongside McMahon at trial.",
      "Zhu, whose role included helping to hire McMahon, was sentenced to two years behind bars. Zheng, who affixed the note to Xu\u2019s door, got 16 months in prison.",
      "McMahon drew support from U.S. Reps. Mike Lawler and Pete Sessions, both Republicans.",
      "In a June 2024 letter included in a court filing this month, they said they believed McMahon is innocent. Lauding his work and many commendations as an officer before a 2001 injury ended his 14-year NYPD career, the lawmakers asked the judge to consider his \u201cunique circumstances\u201d and not sentence him to prison."

    "summary": "The Trump administration released a series of documents after weeks of pressure to prove its contention that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration released documents Wednesday that revealed new details in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador a month ago in what a government lawyer called an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d",
      "The documents were released after weeks of pressure on the government to prove its contention that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. The Trump administration sent him to a notorious megaprison in the Central American country as part of its promised deportation program of alleged criminals.",
      "The Justice Department shared records, not previously made public, detailing how police officers in Maryland assessed Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang during an arrest in 2019. He had no criminal history at the time, which the documents also state, and his attorneys have denied that he is a gang member.",
      "In a document titled \u201cgang field interview sheet,\u201d the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department detailed how in March 2019 it approached Abrego Garcia along with three other people for loitering at a Home Depot parking lot in Hyattsville. Abrego Garcia said in a court filing that he was there looking for day labor work.",
      "Police said he was wearing \u201ca Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents\u201d on the bills.",
      "The officers said such insignia \u2014 indicating \u201cver, oir, y callar\u201d or \u201csee no evil, hear no evil and say no evil\u201d \u2014 was \u201cindicative of the Hispanic gang culture.\u201d The officers said they consulted with a reliable confidential source, who \u201cadvised that [Abrego Garcia] is the rank of \u2018Chequeo\u2019 with the moniker of \u2018Chele\u2019\u201d in the gang.",
      "Abrego Garcia was handed over to immigration authorities, and he wound his way through the legal process. Later in 2019, an immigration judge barred him from being sent to El Salvador. The order said he proved he had a \u201cwell-founded fear of future persecution\u201d from local gangs, and he was granted a withholding of removal\u00a0to the country, which allowed him to stay in the United States temporarily and receive a work permit.",
      "Years later, in 2025, immigration agents stopped Abrego Garcia in an Ikea parking lot. He was deported to El Salvador days later, on March 15.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled last week that the government must \u201cfacilitate\u201d his release from the prison. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said in a meeting at the White House this week that he would not release Abrego Garcia.",
      "In response to social media posts by DHS on Wednesday, his attorneys noted: \u201cThis statement underscores the importance of due process, access to counsel, and the government\u2019s obligation to comply with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision.\u201d",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cWe hear far too much in the mainstream media about sob stories of gang members and criminal illegals and not enough about their victims.\u201d",
      "Police determined during the 2019 arrest that two other people who were with Abrego Garcia in the Home Depot parking lot were gang members, citing one man\u2019s criminal history and another man\u2019s tattoos, as well as information from an unidentified person who was a \u201cpast proven and reliable source of information.\u201d",
      "The documents said that the four men said they were citizens of El Salvador and were \u201cpresent in the United States illegally\u201d and that they did not have immigration documents on them.",
      "Another document released Wednesday, from the Department of Homeland Security in 2019, said police identified two men, one of whom was Abrego Garcia, as being having been previously detained in a murder investigation. Abrego Garcia denied being connected to a murder investigation, the documents say, and he was never charged.",
      "A page of the document includes a contradiction \u2014 at one point it says Abrego Garcia did not claim a fear of returning to his country, but later it says he did claim fear of returning to El Salvador.",
      "The document said Abrego Garcia claimed he had presented sufficient evidence to refute the gang allegation, including character references and his lack of criminal record, minus traffic offenses.",
      "In another document from the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review, a court agreed to deny Abrego Garcia bond after his arrest outside the Home Depot in 2019 and wrote that the allegation that he is a gang member \u201cappears to be trustworthy and is supported by other evidence in the record\u201d in the Prince George\u2019s County police documents.",
      "\u201cThe reason for the Respondent\u2019s arrest given on his Form 1-213 does appear at odds with the Gang Field Interview Sheet, which states that the Respondent was approached because he and others were loitering outside of Home Depot,\u201d the document said, but it added that it still found the allegations of his gang membership to be supported.",
      "Abrego Garcia responded that \u201cthere is no reliable evidence in the record to support\u201d that he is a member of MS-13 and that the allegation \u201cis based on hearsay relayed by a confidential source.\u201d",
      "Aside from the new documents, the Department of Homeland Security posted on social media earlier Wednesday that Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife had sought a temporary protective order against him in 2021. The case was ultimately dismissed. Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, has been a strong, vocal supporter of her husband and has fought for his return.",
      "\u201cAfter surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\u201d Vasquez Sura said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThings did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process.",
      "\u201cNo one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE\u2019s action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation,\u201d she added.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration, Abrego Garcia\u2019s lawyers and an appeals court judge continue to litigate the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that the government facilitate his release.",
      "The Trump administration Wednesday afternoon filed an appeal of U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis\u2019 order last Thursday to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in which she directed the Trump administration to \u201ctake all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Xinis questioned the evidence an immigration judge used to determine that Abrego Garcia is a gang member. She said in a ruling that he has no criminal record in the United States or El Salvador and that the \u201c\u2018evidence\u2019 against Abrego Garcia consisted only of his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13\u2019s \u2018Western\u2019 clique in New York \u2014 a place he has never lived.\u201d",
      "Xinis said Tuesday that she was considering contempt proceedings against\u00a0the Trump administration.",
      "She had ordered the government to supply evidence of efforts it has have taken to \u201cfacilitate\u201d Abrego Garcia\u2019s release, and on Tuesday she criticized the government\u2019s lack of response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve gotten nothing,\u201d Xinis said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten no real response and no real legal justification for not answering.\u201d",
      "In a court-ordered daily status update, DHS general counsel Joseph Mazzara wrote, \u201cGiven the government\u2019s prior clear and unequivocal notice to the court regarding how the government will facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return within the counters of existing law and regulation, there are no further updates.\u201d"

    "summary": "Erik and Lyle Menendez are expected to appear virtually in a Los Angeles courtroom for a two-day hearing that will examine whether they should be freed.",
    "story": [
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez\u00a0are expected to appear virtually in a Los Angeles courtroom for a hearing that will examine a hotly contested question: Should the brothers, who are serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for the shotgun murders of their parents in 1989, be free?",
      "The hearing, which was scheduled for Thursday, could be delayed, after the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office questioned whether reports completed by state officials would be available in time.",
      "In a motion filed Wednesday, a prosecutor said \u201ccomprehensive risk assessments\u201d\u00a0completed by state prison and parole officials\u00a0in a separate matter were ready for review.",
      "\u201cThe People believe that it is very important that the Court request and obtain a copy of these comprehensive risk assessments prior to holding a resentencing hearing in this case,\u201d lead prosecutor Habib Balian wrote in a declaration attached to the motion.",
      "If they are not available for court review before Thursday\u2019s scheduled hearing, it asks for continuation, meaning a delay until a later date.",
      "According to the filing, the judge overseeing the case will hear the motion to delay Thursday morning, ahead of the resentencing hearing. The judge could opt to delay the resentencing hearing, proceed with the hearing as originally scheduled or take the motion under advisement but proceed with the resentencing hearing as planned.",
      "Deadline first reported news of the motion.",
      "Los Angeles County\u2019s former top prosecutor, George Gasc\u00f3n,\u00a0believed the brothers should be resentenced. After they had spent more than three decades in prison, he called them \u201cmodel\u201d inmates, and, in October, his office recommended that Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would make them eligible for parole immediately.",
      "That position has been\u00a0backed by celebrities\u00a0and many of the victims\u2019 relatives, who in recent months have frequently spoken out about the brothers\u2019 accomplishments in prison and the abuse they believe the siblings suffered at the hands of their father, Jos\u00e9 Menendez.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n was voted out in November, and his replacement, Nathan Hochman, has taken a very different view of the case.",
      "Hochman \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and general counsel for a business litigation firm \u2014 has said that after his office launched a review of tens of thousands of pages of trial transcripts, prison records and other evidence, he concluded that the brothers haven\u2019t taken complete responsibility for their crimes.",
      "Last month, Hochman said he would withdraw Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s recommendation.",
      "In court papers and at a news conference, Hochman and his deputies have pointed to 16 \u201cunacknowledged\u201d lies they say the brothers have told about the murders. Among those lies, the prosecutors have said, was the brothers\u2019 claim that they killed their parents in self-defense after Lyle confronted his father about his alleged abuse of Erik.",
      "That claim featured prominently at the brothers\u2019 first trial, which ended with a hung jury in January 1994. During their second trial, a high court ruling barred the brothers from invoking an \u201cimperfect\u201d self-defense, as the legal doctrine is known. They were convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "Prosecutors who tried the brothers have described the murders as cold-blooded and financially motivated. One of the prosecutors in the second trial, Juan Mejia, told NBC News last year that their mother may have known about the alleged abuse and didn\u2019t do anything about it.",
      "\"But there\u2019s no justification for shooting your mom eight times with a shotgun and reloading,\" he said.",
      "Hochman has taken a similar position and said that if the brothers \"come clean\" with the court, their family and the public, they \"can be said to have fully and completely accepted responsibility for their actions.\"",
      "The brothers\u2019 family countered that Hochman's assessment was based on \"outdated arguments, a misleading presentation of facts, and a deep misunderstanding of the purpose of the resentencing process itself.\"",
      "The district attorney could not undo the process his predecessor initiated \"simply because a different administration is in office,\" a family-led advocacy group, the Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition, said in a release this month.",
      "The two sides squared off during a lengthy hearing on the matter last week, with a deputy district attorney recounting the brothers' alleged lies and detailing the \"severity\" of the killings.",
      "The defense focused on the brothers' deeds while they have been incarcerated \u2014 they\u2019ve helped inmates with severe disabilities, completed college courses and established a green space \u201cbeautification\u201d project \u2014 and criticized the prosecution for showing a crime scene photo that the attorney said \"retraumatized\" Menendez family members who attended the hearing.",
      "The family later said they wanted the district attorney's office removed from the case over the image. Hochman's office apologized for not having given warning that the brothers' conduct would be \"described in detail not only in words but also through a crime scene photo.\"",
      "At the end of last week's daylong hearing, the judge overseeing the case said both sides had strong arguments that were best saved for this week.",
      "Regardless of the hearing's outcome, the brothers are still pursuing two other possible paths to freedom: a request for clemency with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a petition that cites what the defense team has described as new evidence that seeks to overturn their convictions. Both efforts continue.",
      "The \"comprehensive risk assessments\u201d that led to Wednesday's motion about a possible delay in the resentencing hearing were done in anticipation of Newsom\u2019s separate clemency investigation.",
      "The Menendez brothers\u2019 defense attorney, Mark Geragos, had no comment on Wednesday's filing.",
      "The DA's office's motion asks that the court \"make all reasonable efforts to obtain the recently completed Comprehensive Risk Assessments from the Governor\u2019s Office.\"",
      "\"If additional time is required to obtain these documents, the People ask the Court to continue the resentencing hearing,\" it reads."

      "\u201cViolence targeted at any political party or political leader is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Shapiro posted on X that day. \u201cIt has no place in Pennsylvania or the United States. I have been briefed on the situation. @PAStatePolice are on the scene in Butler County and working with our federal and local partners.\u201d",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "In the 24 hours after the attack, Shapiro worked closely with law enforcement, including calling Republican members of Congress present at the rally, then-President Joe Biden and the Trump campaign (although he did not speak directly to Trump). He also called and spoke with the family of Corey Comperatore, the Trump supporter who was shot and killed.",
      "Yet three days after an arson attack on Shapiro\u2019s residence in Harrisburg on Sunday, Trump still has not called Shapiro or weighed in significantly to condemn the violence.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shapiro told reporters Wednesday afternoon that he has not yet heard from Trump since the attack. Law enforcement has charged Cody A. Balmer, 38, with the crime, alleging that he broke into the governor\u2019s home and started multiple fires with Molotov cocktails while Shapiro and his family were inside.",
      "The fire came just hours after the Shapiros hosted Passover dinner at their house. Shapiro said they had to evacuate after they were awakened by loud bangs on their door. No one was hurt, but the home sustained significant damage.",
      "Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, put out a statement sharply criticizing Trump for not weighing in.",
      "\"Last year, Trump didn\u2019t hesitate to call Josh Shapiro a \u2018highly overrated Jewish\u00a0governor.\u2019 Now, nearly four days after Gov. Shapiro was targeted in an act of political violence \u2014 reportedly due to his position on Israel \u2014 Trump hasn\u2019t clearly condemned it.\"",
      "\u201cTrump feigns support for Jewish Americans and Israel, but his actions suggest otherwise,\" Soifer added. \"He\u2019s a hypocrite who condones political violence when it suits his political agenda, and his silence amid this targeted arsonist attack on Gov. Shapiro speaks volumes. Shame on the President.\u201d",
      "Others in the Trump administration have condemned the attack, as have prominent congressional Republicans.",
      "\u201cThanks be to God that Governor Shapiro and his family were unharmed in this attack,\u201d Vice President JD Vance commented Sunday on X. \u201cReally disgusting violence, and I hope whoever did it is brought swiftly to justice.\u201d",
      "Speaking with reporters at a Wednesday briefing, Attorney General Pam Bondi said both she and FBI Director Kash Patel spoke with Shapiro after the attack, which she called \u201chorrific.\u201d",
      "Bondi said she \"firmly believe[d]\" the attack was intended to kill Shapiro, pledging to continue to work with state authorities to do \u201canything we can to help convict the person that did this and keep them behind bars, as long as possible.\u201d",
      "Shapiro himself noted Monday that he had been in touch with Patel, who promised that the federal government would assist in the investigation.",
      "The same day, a reporter asked Trump whether the FBI had determined a motive behind the attack on Shapiro.",
      "\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t, but the attacker was not a fan of Trump, I understand \u2014 just from what I read and from what I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Trump said in his most extensive comments on the fire. \u201cThe attacker basically wasn\u2019t a fan of anybody. He\u2019s probably just a whack job. And certainly a thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.\u201d",
      "Newly released search warrants suggest that Balmer was upset by Shapiro\u2019s stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Around 2:50 a.m. Sunday, about 50 minutes after the fire, he reportedly called 911 and told a dispatcher that he \u201cwill not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.\u201d It is not entirely clear whether he was referring to Shapiro.",
      "Balmer\u2019s social media presence suggested anti-government views, including negative content about Biden.",
      "Shapiro told reporters Wednesday that the political motivation behind the attack was not the most important issue.",
      "\u201cI know that there are people out there who want to ascribe their own viewpoints as to what happened here and why,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI choose not to participate in that. I said after the assassination attempt on the president \u2026 in Butler, I said in Altoona \u2014 after we captured the individual who shot and killed the United Healthcare CEO \u2014 and I said on Sunday that this kind of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it. This is not how we resolve our differences. And this is not OK. This level of violence has to end, and it has to be roundly condemned by everyone, both political parties, people from all different walks of life.\u201d",
      "The conduct of Shapiro \u2014 who is widely discussed as a potential 2028 presidential candidate and was in the running to be Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate last year \u2014 in assisting with the Butler investigation drew widespread praise, including from Republicans in the state.",
      "Speaking with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in July, Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., said he appreciated having heard from Shapiro \u201cimmediately\u201d as he was leaving the rally, adding that Shapiro asked: \u201cHey, what happened? What can we do? Are we \u2014 do we have enough state troopers?\u201d",
      "Meuser later told NBC News that Shapiro \u201cwas on the job\u201d and that \u201cit was a great conversation.\u201d",
      "Yet Meuser, a potential challenger to Shapiro in 2026, was far more critical of him Wednesday, suggesting that while the arsonist who attacked the Governor\u2019s Residence was \u201ca psycho,\u201d Shapiro\u2019s rhetoric and actions may be contributing to the problem.",
      "\u201cThey got to tone it down, too,\u201d Meuser, who earlier posted a lengthy condemnation of the attack, said in a radio interview. \u201cI mean, every action Josh Shapiro has taken against the president has either been a lawsuit or a falsehood. \u2026 That\u2019s not helpful, either.\u201d",
      "Shapiro seemed surprised by the remarks when a reporter asked him about them Wednesday, replying, \u201cHe said that?\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve said for years leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt would appear the congressman failed to measure up to that.\u201d"

      "The program had been in limbo since the start of the Trump administration as Elon Musk and the\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0have slashed their way through the federal government. Musk posted in February on his social media site, X, that he had \u201cdeleted\u201d 18F, a government agency that worked on technology projects such as Direct File.",
      "There was some hope that Musk, with his DOGE team of computer programmers, could take over Direct File and improve it. But the two people familiar with the decision to end Direct File said its future became clear when the IRS staff assigned to the program were told in mid-March to stop working on its development for the 2026 tax filing season.",
      "The two people were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "Adam Ruben, a vice president at the liberal-leaning Economic Security Project, said \u201cthe fix was in from the beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is an outrage to see everyday taxpayers play no role in this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cCutting costs and saving money for families were just empty campaign promises.\u201d",
      "But David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government\u2019s effects on the economy, said Direct File was \u201cproblematic\u201d from day 1, citing the program\u2019s costs and noting that many people who started the process never finished. According to the IRS 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File and 140,803 submitted accepted returns in 2024.",
      "\u201cFrom hidden costs to taxpayer confusion, the program is riddled with issues,\u201d Williams said.",
      "An original architect of the Direct File program told The Associated Press in a statement that \u201cthis is sad news for taxpayers and the IRS.\u201d \u201cDirect File was a wildly successful government startup, people who used the tool loved it because it was simple, saved time and cost them nothing.\u201d",
      "Direct File was rolled out as a pilot program in 2024 after the IRS was tasked with looking into how to create a \u201cdirect file\u201d system as part of the money it received from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by Biden in 2022. The Democratic administration spent tens of millions of dollars developing the program.",
      "Last May, the agency announced that the program would be made permanent.",
      "But the IRS has faced intense blowback to Direct File from private tax preparation companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software and have spent millions\u00a0lobbying Congress. The average American typically spends about $140 preparing returns each year.",
      "Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit,, said in a statement that \u201cDirect File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d",
      "The IRS accepted 140,803 returns filed by taxpayers using Direct File in the 12 states where it was available last tax season. It was expanded to include half the country this year. It is unclear how many taxpayers have used Direct File this year.",
      "Amanda Renteria, CEO of Code for America, which worked with the IRS to create a state tax filing integration program for Direct File, said the decision was \u201ca betrayal of public trust at precisely the time government should be demonstrating its ability to deliver basic services effectively.\u201d",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a proponent of building out Direct File, said in a statement that Trump and Musk \u201care going after Direct File because it stops giant tax prep companies from ripping taxpayers off for services that should be free. Americans want a free and easy way to file their taxes \u2014 Trump and Musk want to take that away.\u201d"

      "Buford earned the meal after he wandered home Tuesday morning with a 2-year-old boy who disappeared the day before from his home in Seligman, Arizona, the Yavapai County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.",
      "Dunton\u2019s ranch, in a remote part of the state roughly 100 miles south of Grand Canyon National Park, is 7 miles from the boy\u2019s home, according to the sheriff\u2019s office, which noted that dozens of search-and-rescue personnel and deputies had spent the night searching for him.",
      "The sheriff's office posted details of the disappearance at 11:08 p.m. Monday. As of 8:20 a.m. Tuesday, the sheriff's office said, the toddler had been found and was safe.",
      "Dunton said he'd learned of the missing boy that morning. The combination of his age, the temperature outside \u2014 it was in the high 40s \u2014 and the rough terrain made Dunton concerned the toddler wouldn't be found alive. The area surrounding his ranch is \"all big, thick trees and mountains and canyons and boulder piles,\" he said. \"Not real friendly for a 2-year-old.\"",
      "In the post announcing that the boy had been found, the sheriff's office said a helicopter involved in the search spotted two mountain lions in the area.",
      "Still, Dunton said, when he got in his pickup to drive to town that morning, he saw Buford walking down the driveway. A little boy with blond hair, pajama pants and a tank top was with him, he recalled.",
      "It was around 7:30 a.m.",
      "\"I knew it was him,\" Dunton said. \"He was all disoriented and crying. And so I jumped out and ran and grabbed him and told him 'you're OK, you're OK,' and took him inside and got him some water and food.\"",
      "\"He calmed down pretty quick and turned back into a 2-year-old,\" Dunton said.",
      "When he asked the boy whether he had walked all night, Dunton said, the boy responded, \"No.\"",
      "\"He kept saying, 'tree, tree,'\" Dunton recalled. \"So I said, 'You laid down under a tree?' And he said, 'Yeah.' And I said, 'Did my dog find you?' And he said, 'Yeah.'\"",
      "The boy wasn't hurt, Dunton said, and even though he got him a blanket, the boy didn't want it.",
      "\"I said, 'You're the toughest 2-year-old I've ever seen,'\" he said. \"There's people saying, 'There's no way he made it that far. And something's fishy about this story.' And, like, I physically went and found his little foot tracks.\"",
      "\"He walked that entire way,\" Dunton added.",
      "Anatolian Pyrenees are guard dogs by nature, he said, and Buford typically sleeps all day and patrols his ranch at night to keep coyotes away.",

    "story": [
      "A gay couple said a beachfront Sheraton resort in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, quoted them more than $80,000 for their wedding ceremony and guest rooms, said there was no availability until March 2027 and gave their two friends much better rates for their hypothetical opposite-sex weddings and, in one case, saying several dates were available in early 2026.",
      "Jeremy Alexander and Ryan Sheepwash, who live in Vernon, British Columbia, posted about their experience on social media last week after months of back-and-forth with the hotel and feeling conflicted about whether to speak out publicly, the couple said.",
      "\u201cWe felt we\u2019d be indirectly complicit to the system if we\u2019re aware of it and we\u2019re not combating it,\u201d Alexander told NBC News. \u201cThat was the major driving factor in us wanting to put the story out there.\u201d",
      "The Sheraton Buganvilias Resort and Convention Center didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Marriott International, the parent company of Sheraton Hotels and Resorts, said in an email that the company has reached out to the couple \"to learn more about their experience and are working with the property to offer a solution.\"",
      "\"The Sheraton Buganvilias has been active in the LGBTQ community in Puerto Vallarta for years, not only hosting LGBTQ+ weddings and groups but also supporting Pride events in Puerto Vallarta,\" the spokesperson said. \"Marriott remains steadfast in our commitment to ensure guests are treated with respect and understanding.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson previously said that the Puerto Vallarta property is \u201coperated by a third-party franchisee\u201d but didn\u2019t provide further information about how that affects the franchise\u2019s policies.",
      "Alexander and Sheepwash got engaged in Puerto Vallarta in February 2024 and decided they wanted to get married in the picturesque resort locale on Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast. They returned in November to tour wedding venues in the city, which they noted is widely known as an LGBTQ-friendly vacation destination.",
      "After they looked at several options, the couple decided on the Sheraton Buganvilias. They said Gabriela Espinoza, the hotel\u2019s wedding coordinator, told them during their tour that the rate for the deluxe wedding package ceremony would be $8,500 for 50 guests.",
      "Once they returned home, in late November, the couple requested an official quote by email for a wedding in February or March 2026. Espinoza responded several weeks later informing the couple that the hotel had no remaining wedding availability in 2026, according to one of several emails the couple shared with NBC News.",
      "Alexander and Sheepwash then requested a rate for February or March 2027, and Espinoza responded in mid-January with a quote for the first week of March 2027. If they had 50 guests staying in 25 rooms for three nights, the cost per person would be $485 per person per night, and the ceremony would cost $11,500. To reserve the date and the block of rooms, the contract said, the couple would have to put down a deposit of $36,375, which is equal to 50% of the total room costs for all of their guests.",
      "The couple said they were shocked and confused by the amount, especially the eye-popping deposit, which was well beyond their budget. Sheepwash said he then became suspicious and Googled \u201cSheraton Buganvilias Puerto Vallarta homophobic.\u201d Among the top search results was a 2019 article from the LGBTQ news website the Washington Blade about the resort\u2019s declining to book a same-sex wedding for travel vlogger Josh Rimer and his then-fianc\u00e9, he said.",
      "At the time, Jeff Flaherty, a spokesperson for Marriott, apologized and told the New York Daily News that the company was \u201cdeeply concerned.\u201d He added, \u201cMarriott has long been committed to providing an environment where all are welcome including our LGBTQ guests and their loved ones.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson for Marriott didn\u2019t respond to questions about what actions it took at the Sheraton after the 2019 incident.",
      "After Sheepwash learned about Rimer\u2019s experience, he said, he and Alexander asked two friends to request quotes from the Sheraton Buganvilias for hypothetical opposite-sex weddings.",
      "In late January, their friend Marcia Escontria requested a quote for a deluxe wedding package and weeklong stay for 50 guests in 25 rooms in February 2026 \u2014 the month Alexander and Sheepwash originally wanted to book their wedding. Escontria said she told the resort that she was helping friends named Alex and Michelle plan their wedding.",
      "On Feb. 7, Ximena Esparza, a junior wedding planner for the resort, told Escontria in an email that the hotel had availability for a wedding on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2026, and provided her a quote with a room rate of $254 per person per night, with a ceremony cost of $8,500. To reserve the date and the block of rooms, the contract said, the couple would have to put down a deposit of $1,700, which is equal to 20% of the ceremony cost.",
      "On Feb. 11, four days after Escontria received her quote, Alexander emailed Espinoza, the wedding planner he had been communicating with, to \u201cconfirm if any dates could work in 2026.\u201d She responded that day and said there was no availability remaining in 2026.",
      "Though it appeared Escontria was offered their preferred wedding date at much lower rates, the couple said they wanted to be sure that they received an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison for the room rates and the total wedding quote they were offered for March 2027, so they asked another friend to request a quote for around that time.",
      "In late March, their friend Simon, who asked to go only by his first name to protect his privacy, requested a quote for the same kind of wedding package and three-night stay for his and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s wedding in February or March 2027, according to emails he shared with NBC News.",
      "In a March 29 email, Esparza told Simon that if he and his fianc\u00e9e had 50 guests staying in 25 rooms for three nights, the room rate would be $272 per person per night and the ceremony would cost $9,350. To reserve the date and the block of rooms, the contract said, the couple would have to put down a deposit of $1,870, which is equal to 20% of the ceremony cost.",
      "To directly compare the rates he received to the rates Alexander and Sheepwash received, Simon also asked Esparza whether the resort had any availability during the first week of March 2027 and, if so, whether the prices would change. Esparza said in her response that the resort did have availability and \u201ccan honor the same prices for the first week of March.\u201d",
      "Asked to comment on the email correspondences and the differences in room rates, ceremony costs and deposit requirements, Esparza declined to comment and Espinoza didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "After Simon received his quote, Sheepwash said, he and Alexander felt angry and powerless. They decided to post about it on social media and \u201ctalk from the heart,\u201d Alexander said. The videos they shared Friday on Instagram and TikTok have amassed more than 150,000 views combined.",
      "\u201cWe just want to let other people know,\u201d Sheepwash said, noting that it has been six years since Rimer\u2019s story became public. \u201cHow many people have had the same situation happen to them?\u201d",
      "Alexander said a diversity, equity and inclusion representative from Marriott called him Friday, a few hours after he shared the video on Instagram, and told him it was looking into the incident. Marriott didn\u2019t confirm whether that call happened or its contents.",
      "Marriott has long supported the LGBTQ community. It has been a member of the IGLTA, the LGBTQ travel association formerly known as the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association, since 2010, and the organization recognized it in 2018 as being in the \u201ctop tier of global brand leaders that have committed to year-round support for the association and LGBTQ-welcoming travel.\u201d The Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy organization in the United States, also gave the company a perfect 100 score on its 2025 Corporate Equality Index, which rates companies on their LGBTQ-inclusive policies and benefits.",
      "'A history of discrimination'",
      "Alexander and Sheepwash, who are still looking for a wedding venue, said they don\u2019t necessarily want an apology from Sheraton Buganvilias, because they believe what happened to them isn\u2019t an isolated incident.",
      "While he was researching the hotel, Sheepwash found a TikTok video posted by Daniel Galecio, a wedding planner in Puerto Vallarta, who said he received an email from Espinoza on Nov. 13 \u2014 the day before Alexander and Sheepwash toured the resort with Espinoza \u2014 saying, in Spanish, that because of internal company policies, the resort is currently unable to host same-sex weddings.",
      "Galecio shared a copy of the email with NBC News, adding that he initially reached out to the Sheraton Buganvilias to request a quote for an opposite-sex wedding. After he received that quote, he said, he told Espinoza by email that he had gay clients who were also interested in getting married there. He was shocked by her response, he said, noting that Mexico\u2019s constitution was amended in 2001 to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Same-sex marriage has been legal throughout the country since 2022.",
      "\u201cThat hotel has a history of years of discrimination, and all the city knows \u2014 all the gays know,\u201d Galecio said.",
      "Marriott didn\u2019t respond to Galecio\u2019s claims.",
      "Alexander said he wants Marriott to commit to meaningful change at the Puerto Vallarta resort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very clear there\u2019s an issue all the way to the top at this particular Sheraton of homophobia,\u201d he said. Marriott \u201cwould need to make some seriously impactful change before I\u2019d be entertaining what they have to say there. They are part of a lot of queer travel alliances, and the actions have to line up with reality, and right now it doesn\u2019t.\u201d"

But that energy is still out there, and as the first campaign finance reports of 2025 reveal, the most outspoken Democrats in Washington are benefiting from it.",
      "As Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman and Joe Murphy report, a handful of vocal anti-Trump progressives posted massive fundraising hauls during the first three months of the year \u2014 even though they either aren\u2019t up for re-election in 2026 or won\u2019t face competitive races.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., led the pack, collecting $11.5 million over that span, including almost $10 million from donations of less than $200. He spent $3.2 million and had a whopping $19 million in the bank.",

      "The Trump immigration move that flew under the radar",
      "Many people across the country are galvanized by the case of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, as Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, discovered when angry participants confronted him at a town hall.",
      "Almost unnoticed amid the furor was an order the Department of Homeland Security issued late Friday to send tens of thousands of people back to Afghanistan and Cameroon, where they could face starvation, imprisonment or death.",
      "It is a familiar tactic when administrations of both parties want to \u201cbury\u201d unfavorable news: releasing decisions just before the weekend. (Script writers on \u201cThe West Wing\u201d used to call it \u201ctake out the trash day.\u201d)",
      "The DHS move canceled a program giving Temporary Protected Status in the United States for almost all Afghan and Cameroonian asylum-seekers who qualified. As of late last year, 9,000 Afghans and 3,000 people from Cameroon were in the program, according to the Congressional Research Service. Under the program, they can remain in the United States temporarily and get jobs. Many of the Afghans are women, who were targeted by the Taliban for their gender, especially those linked to the U.S. military, the State Department or civic organizations during decades of American war and occupation.",
      "In Cameroon, many of those affected are minorities in a country ravaged by racial and ethnic violence. An estimated 900,000 people in Cameroon are displaced internally, and 60,000 have fled the country. The United Nations reports that Cameroon is also harboring refugees from Nigeria, Chad, Niger and the Central African Republic, countries that also suffer from extreme poverty and ethnic strife.",
      "James Sussman of the International Rescue Committee told NBC News that sending those people back to their homelands is a violation of both federal and international law, even as asylum-seekers already face yearlong delays because of backlogs. And last week, the State Department canceled humanitarian aid programs in Afghanistan provided by what used to be the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Sussman said, \u201cPeople who come to the U.S. under the protected status are supposed to be protected from being sent back to the turmoil in the countries from which they\u2019ve come.\u201d",
      "Critics say a common thread connects the administration\u2019s treatment of those about to lose their Temporary Protected Status with its abrupt cancellations of student visas and deportations of people like Abrego Garcia. In all such cases, they say, there is a lack of due process and humanitarian concern that undergirded past Republican and Democratic administrations.",

    "story": [
      "Bowen Yang is in a splashy new movie, \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d but he also has some serious thoughts about his high-profile role playing Vice President JD Vance on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "While discussing the new film, in theaters Friday, about a man who gets caught up in a sham marriage between his boyfriend and his best girlfriend over a green card and in vitro fertilization, Yang reflected on his identity as a gay Asian American and how it affects his work playing Vance.",
      "Though fans have praised his depiction of the vice president, he said it\u2019s been difficult for him \u2014 but that he\u2019s put forth the same effort as with any role.",
      "\u201cI approached it in as disciplined of a way as I think anyone could, which was I hired, I worked with this accent coach that I love, where we found the right balance between, like, Appalachian and Ohio,\u201d Yang told NBC News. \u201cI have a serviceable JD Vance, but I was like you know what, this is a charge that I don\u2019t take lightly. Like, I want to make it pop as best as I can. I\u2019ve been very lucky to play political figures on that show.\u201d",
      "Yang, the first Asian American and one of the few openly LGBTQ+ cast members in the 50-year history of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d said his beliefs and identity affect his work.",
      "In the end, Yang said he\u2019s \u201cchecked every box,\u201d but he thinks the role of Vance overall leaves a lot to be desired.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s just such a tragic figure in terms of American history,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it just doesn\u2019t have the give that you want it to. And that\u2019s OK.\u201d",
      "He said portraying major figures in a climate where identity and politics are so divisive can feel like a no-win situation.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no universal agreement on what something funny is, on what humor is,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just going to be alienating no matter what.\u201d",
      "He also joked on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d that he asked \u201cSNL\u201d creator Lorne Michaels to not make him do the part.",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d and NBC News share the same parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "In \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d Yang plays Chris, a birdwatcher in a five-year relationship with his wealthy Korean boyfriend, Min (Han Gi-chan). As Min\u2019s U.S. visa is set to expire, Chris reluctantly agrees to facilitate Min\u2019s pretend-marriage with his best friend Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) so Min can stay in the country and pay for Angela and her partner Lee\u2019s (Lily Gladstone) next round of IVF.",
      "But then his grandma plans an over-the-top Korean wedding banquet.",
      "The movie is a remake of Ang Lee\u2019s 1993 film of the same name, a rare portrayal of a queer Asian American at the time. Yang said that the original film resonated with his experience in college, after his parents sent him to conversion therapy in his teens.",
      "\u201cI was back in the closet with my family, and the original film fades out on this uncertainty with the parents,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey still hug and they still embrace, but it hangs on that uncertainty, and I felt like that was where I was at in life at the time. It gave me this blueprint, or it still gives me this extrapolating point to sort of work towards that \u2014 that if I can get there, then I\u2019ll be OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a much better place,\" Yang said. \"There are still obviously things that cannot fully be known in a mutual way. But I give them a lot of grace for just meeting me where I\u2019m at, because that is not something I ever expected.\u201d",
      "Director and co-screenwriter Andrew Ahn said writing, casting Yang and filming the movie was \u201cwish fulfillment.\u201d",
      "\u201cChris, as a character, is so much this amalgamation of my boyfriend and my group of friends, and so it just made sense,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cI was like, I want to cast a friend, you know?\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Ahn said the film was his way of creating the family he wants for himself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy to say that within my friend group, my desire to have children feels radical. \u2026 I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s in my future,\" Ahn said. \"I tragically told my boyfriend, \u2018It\u2019s OK if we don\u2019t have kids, like maybe I\u2019ll just make movies about families.\u2019\u201d"

    "summary": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agency will soon announce autism studies aimed at identifying \u201cenvironmental toxins\u201d that may be responsible for rising rates in children.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Wednesday that the agency will announce, within three weeks, a series of studies aimed at identifying \u201cenvironmental toxins\u201d he claims are responsible for a dramatic rise in autism rates in children in the U.S.",
      "Kennedy spoke a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report that found in 2022, 1 in 31 kids in the U.S. were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by their 8th birthday \u2014 up from 1 in 150 kids in 2000, when the agency began collecting data.",
      "Autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds in the new report were estimated at 1 in 34.",
      "Pediatricians and other health experts have attributed the increase largely to greater awareness and better surveillance of the disorder. Autism\u2019s definition has also broadened to identify milder cases, which has contributed to more diagnoses.",
      "Despite evidence that suggests there is no one single cause of autism, Kennedy is vowing to uncover an underlying reason by September.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday, Kennedy claimed, without evidence, that environmental exposures \u2014 such as the nation\u2019s food supply, water or medicine \u2014 are likely contributing to rising autism rates in kids. He called autism a \u201cpreventable disease,\u201d an assertion pushed back on by health experts.",
      "\u201cWe know what the historic numbers are,\u201d Kennedy told reporters, \u201cand we know what the numbers are today, and it\u2019s time for everybody to stop attributing this to this ideology of epidemic denial.\u201d",
      "He also dismissed conclusions from the CDC report\u2019s authors, who attributed the rise to more awareness and better surveillance. The report also reaffirmed evidence suggesting that genetics likely plays a role.",
      "\u201cWe know it\u2019s an environmental exposure. It has to be,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cGenes do not cause epidemics. It can provide a vulnerability. You need an environmental toxin.\u201d",
      "Kennedy said the agency will look at mold, food additives, pesticides, water, medicines, ultrasound and obesity.",
      "He didn\u2019t provide guidance as to which outside groups, if any, would support the agency\u2019s research or how the studies would be conducted and when.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Alison Singer, the president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit group for families with autism, said the CDC\u2019s report Tuesday \u201cis the most convincing evidence yet that changes in factors like access to services and de-stigmatization\u201d are leading to the increases in prevalence of autism.",
      "Singer said Kennedy made a series of false assertions about autism  during Wednesday\u2019s news conference, including that the disorder is caused by something in the environment.",
      "An overwhelming amount of evidence points to a genetic cause, Singer said, adding that in about 20% of autism cases, one genetic variant can explain the disorder.",
      "In other cases, she said, there may be multiple genetic mutations interacting to cause autism.",
      "At the same time, most researchers acknowledge that\u00a0genes don\u2019t explain every case of autism and that when people develop autistic traits, it may be because of a combination of genetics and environmental exposures. Some research has indicated that a mother's exposure to air pollution may be linked to an increased risk of autism in children.",
      "The health secretary\u2019s remarks on environmental exposures echo his previous comments about the disorder.",
      "Kennedy\u00a0has repeatedly suggested that vaccines are linked to autism \u2014 a connection that has been widely debunked.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he isn\u2019t persuaded that Kennedy\u2019s studies will uncover anything new, saying that the health secretary has already come to a predetermined conclusion.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is you\u2019re going to hear from him that he\u2019s looked behind the curtain at the FDA, looked behind the curtain at the CDC, and he has found things that are shocking to him, shocking about the degree to which Big Pharma has\u00a0influenced those people,\u201d Offit said."

      "In an interview with TODAY in September 2024, McFarland confirmed that he had plans to throw a sequel.

      "In Episode 6 titled \u201cNot Today Satan,\u201d after Natalia (Imogen Faith Reid) is left alone in her own apartment by her adoptive parents Michael and Kristine Barnett, she meets and receives help from a woman named Cynthia Mans.",
      "Portrayed by Christina Hendricks, Cynthia befriends a struggling Natalia, who has been having issues walking and taking care of herself. Yet Natalia questions her intentions.",
      "Cynthia is inspired by the real-life Cynthia Mans, who did meet the real Natalia Grace while she was living alone in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace, a Ukrainian orphan with dwarfism, had been adopted by the Barnetts in 2010, before they accused her of being a grown woman pretending to be an adult. The Barnetts had Grace tested and were able to legally change her birth certificate to show that she was born in 1989, the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana stated.",
      "The couple then moved her into her own apartment, helping her get disability funding before they moved to Canada with their three biological children.",
      "However, the Court of Appeals document showed that Grace\u2019s Ukrainian adoption paperwork\u00a0stated she was born in 2003. After meeting Cynthia Mans and her husband Antwon Mans, Grace moved in with them, per the Indiana Court of Appeals document.",
      "\u201cYou almost can\u2019t believe that this is based on true circumstances,\u201d Hendricks tells TODAY.com. \u201cThe script itself was already so amazingly written, and I thought they did a really great job (where) halfway through you go, \u2018Wait ... I thought I knew what was going on,\u2019 and bam, all sudden everything shifts.\u201d",
      "Hendricks explains that her character comes at a time when Natalia \u201cneeds a place of comfort, protection, nurturing and a safe space.\u201d",
      "Cynthia, who has also taken in other children in need, Hendrick says, creates a family and community for Natalia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s also some moments where you start to question what Cynthia\u2019s intentions are,\u201d the actor says. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s one of the things that I like about this show is you really have to pay attention to each character, because nothing is quite as it seems.\u201d",
      "Among the first moments where Natalia doesn't know if she can trust Cynthia is when the older woman offers to drive her home and invites her over for dinner after seeing her living conditions.",
      "She also helps her grocery shop but once at the store, she suggests that Natalia pay for her family groceries using her food stamps.From Hendricks\u2019 perspective, Cynthia is a \u201ccomplicated and interesting\u201d individual.",
      "\u201cI would say that I went about this as a person who was trying to nurture her and trying to protect her,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that people are complicated and I think even if you are trying to help someone, and if you are trying to extend that, there can be all sorts of situations in your life that it\u2019s not just going to be one pure thing.\u201d",
      "From this episode, one could say that through Natalia, Cynthia attempts to better her family\u2019s financial and living situation.",
      "In real life, according to a document from the Court of Appeals of Indiana viewed by TODAY.com, the Manses filed a court petition in 2016 to seek guardianship of Grace. They also testified against Michael Barnett during his 2022 trial, where he and his wife were accused of multiple charges including neglect of a dependent. Michael Barnett was acquitted of his charges, while Kristine Barnett\u2019s charges were dismissed.",

Starting when Piper was 11, her account featured videos of her and her posse of tween sidekicks pulling pranks, performing skits and doing goofy viral challenges for millions of followers.",
      "However, for all their upbeat smiles on camera, Piper and her friends were experiencing a much darker reality behind the scenes, including alleged \u201cverbal, physical and, at times, sexual abuse\u201d at the hands of Piper\u2019s mother and producer, Tiffany Smith, a lawsuit filed in January 2022 by 11 former \u201cSquad\u201d members says.",

      "Read on to learn more about teen influencer Piper Rockelle, why her mom was sued for $22 million, and where they both are now.",
      "Who is Piper Rockelle?",
      "Piper Rockelle, 17, is an influencer with more than 30 million followers across YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.",
      "She rose to viral fame at age 8 when she began posting videos on YouTube with help from her mom and \u201cmomager,\u201d Tiffany Smith.",
      "When Piper was 11, Smith began recruiting other kids to appear in her daughter\u2019s videos, and the group of tweens and teens became known as \u201cPiper\u2019s Squad.\u201d",
      "Over the next few years, the Squad churned out hundreds of videos of themselves pulling pranks on each other, dancing to lip sync videos, completing viral challenges, and confessing to their crushes.",
      "The channel was incredibly lucrative for Smith and her daughter. At one point, Piper was earning more than half a million dollars per month for her video content, according to The Los Angeles Times.",
      "Other members of the Squad routinely earned five figures per month via their own YouTube channels thanks to their association with Piper, according to a 2022 court document.",
      "While Piper\u2019s channel was presented as a harmless collection of videos about a group of tweens\u2019 silly pranks and adventures, it reportedly had a darker side.",
      "As the years went on, former Squad members began speaking out about physical, sexual and emotional abuse they had allegedly suffered at the hands of Smith. Accusations of exploitation and labor violations also arose.",
      "A group of former Squad members sued Smith and her business partner, Hunter Hill, in January 2022. Piper was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.",

      "The complaint sought damages for sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among several other alleged violations.",
      "The plaintiffs, all of whom were minors when the lawsuit was filed, accused Smith of \u201cgrossly inappropriate, offensive and abusive treatment.\u201d They claimed Smith made vulgar comments about their bodies, and at times touched them inappropriately.",
      "According to the complaint, Smith encouraged minors in the Squad to behave sexually with each other and to act proactively in videos and photos, such as urging them to make \u201csexy kissing faces\u201d or to \u201cwear something sluttier\u201d because \u201csex sells.\u201d",
      "According to the complaint, Smith and Hill would \u201csabotage\u201d children who left the Squad, targeting their individual YouTube channels.",
      "Smith and Hill allegedly engaged in a variety of tactics to \u201ctank\u201d former Squad members\u2019 online platforms, such as flooding them with bot subscribers, which can negatively affect how videos are promoted on YouTube, and falsely flagging their channels as \u201cinappropriate\u201d to get their content restricted.",
      "These alleged tactics led to a \u201csignificant loss\u201d in subscribers and viewerships for the plaintiffs, which translated to a loss of income, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smith denied the allegations against her. In July 2023, she countersued for $30 million, accusing the plaintiffs\u2019 mothers of attempting to extort her by making false allegations of sexual abuse, according to NBC News. She later voluntarily abandoned the lawsuit.",
      "In a December 2022 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Smith questioned the motives of the plaintiffs bringing the lawsuit against her.",
      "\u201cThis whole case is based on lies that are driven by financial jealousy,\u201d she said. \u201cFinancial jealousy of a 15-year-old girl.\u201d",
      "Smith has also denied allegations that she violated California labor laws in the filming of the Squad videos. Several parents of former Squad members have said their children filmed up to 12 hours per day and did not receive proper education on set, according to the Times.",

      "\u201cImagine if these kids had been on a movie set for Lionsgate,\u201d Matthew Sarelson, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the Times in 2022. \u201cPeople would go to jail if this had happened at a studio.\u201d",
      "Smith has denied that she was running a professional production studio and said it was parents\u2019 responsibility to manage their kids\u2019 schooling.",
      "The Squad members\u2019 lawsuit was settled in October 2024 for $1.85 million, according to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis was never about the money \u2014 it was about holding an individual accountable, telling the truth, and taking a step toward healing,\u201d Angela Sharbino, the parent of one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement, according to NBC News. \u201cAll of these kids have now moved on from the \u2018Squad\u2019 and are closing this chapter of their lives.\u201d",
      "Where are Piper Rockelle and Tiffany Smith now?Piper continues to share content on social media.",
      "After the 2022 lawsuit was filed, YouTube demonetized Piper\u2019s channel, meaning she could no longer earn revenue from her videos. She still posts occasional YouTube videos, such as a 10-minute vlog entitled \u201cWeek in my Life as a Full Time Influencer\u201d in November 2024.",
      "\u201cObviously I film vlogs like this, but I don\u2019t really get a lot out of it besides the satisfaction of knowing you guys enjoy watching them, and I get a lot of fun memories that I can go back and watch, which I think is cool,\u201d she says in the video.",
      "The teen adds that she now does other types of work to \u201cyou know, keep the house over my head,\u201d such as brand deals and paid TikTok videos.",
      "Smith and Hill still appear to oversee the creation of Piper\u2019s videos. In her 2024 \u201cWeek in the Life\u201d video, a narrator who appears to be Hill says Smith \u201ccompletely rearranged and decorated\u201d a room in their house so Piper could film TikTok videos at all hours.",

      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Piper chimes in.",
      "Piper has more than 14 million fans on TikTok, where she posts frequent videos featuring her hanging out with her boyfriend, Capri, lip syncing to viral songs, and sometimes posing in bikinis and other revealing outfits.",
      "She also has an account on BrandArmy, a platform that allows creators as young as 13 to share paid photos and videos of themselves, with parental oversight. The site is only open to subscribers over the age of 18.",
      "In her 2024 vlog, Piper says she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opportunity to create content, but also shares a candid look at her life and responsibilities.",
      "\u201cI have no room to complain about my life because things could be a lot worse. But what I do have to say is, it is hard work on my end. I\u2019ve never had, like, a normal job, but whatever I\u2019m doing right now, it feels like a job. It takes a lot out of me. I go to bed at night and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my God, what did I do today?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of everything, all I want to do most of the time is just go work out because it makes me so happy,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, the one moment in my life when everything is quiet and I don\u2019t have to think about anything or please anybody.\u201d",
      "How has Piper Rockelle responded to the documentary?",
      "Rockelle has seemed to speak about the documentary in multiple TikTok videos.",
      "In one released after the documentary, she dances with the following caption in front of her: \"Can't wait to tell my story and not have other people tell it for me.\"",
      "She also posted a video about responding to rumors, without specifying which she is addressing. In it, she speaks to the AI app Tolan.",
      "\"This rumor, unfortunately, has kind of hurt my lifestyle in a lot of ways but I just kept going as best as I can,\" she said. \"Is it worth trying to tell the truth to everyone who believes this rumor or should I just brush it off?'"

      "In the two-part crossover, \u201cPlay with Fire,\u201d Benson's team responds to the scene of a brutal murder after she receives a mysterious phone call. The squad teams up with Brady's crew to investigate a pattern of rape and murder targeting marginalized women.",
      "An April 10 promo offered more insight, implying the victim is Maria Recinos, a police officer who joined the department last year. Benson has a history with Maria and saved her as a young girl in the Season Seven episode \"911,\" which also won Hargitay an Emmy Award.",
      "Carisi works with Price to see if they\u2019re able to prosecute the case and if they have enough evidence even though, Scanavino says, \u201cit becomes somewhat obvious as to who\u2019s responsible\u201d for the crime \u201cthrough several twists and turns.\u201d",
      "He also teases \u201cvery good courtroom stuff\u201d combined with \u201ca lot of great detective work.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone working together,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a true crossover in that it\u2019s not just a couple scenes here and there. It\u2019s a two-hour event.\u201d",
      "Scanavino, who told TODAY.com last year he would \u201clove to cross over into that world\u201d on the mothership, says the experience visiting the set and collaborating with those actors was \u201creally cool.\u201d",
      "\u201cI almost felt like I was an animal that had been raised with a different species of animal, and then I came home to the den for the first time,\u201d he says while laughing, \u201cbecause they had this really nice legal set, and the district attorney\u2019s offices, and there were all these lawyer extras zooming around. We don\u2019t really have that on our show. So I felt, \u2018Oh my goodness, look at this whole other world! I\u2019m a lawyer, and so are these people.\u2019\u201d",
      "He adds it was \u201cawesome\u201d working with Dancy and Goldwyn and visiting their \u201cbeautiful\u201d set.",
      "Scanavino says his favorite part of the experience happens when the team is not filming and \u201cjust busting chops and joking around in between takes.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone there is very funny. Hugh is very funny, Tony is very funny, Maura is very funny,\u201d he says before laughing. \u201cYou put Mariska into it, who\u2019s hilarious, and everyone is really kind of like a bunch of unruly third graders. And the directors are like, \u2018Everyone! Please focus.\u2019 So those are the best parts.\u201d",
      "As for how his character gels with Dancy\u2019s, Scanavino says while they have different styles, they \u201cget along very well.\u201d",
      "\u201cI get a sense in the crossover Carisi is kind of more headstrong in terms of prosecuting, and Price is more kind of, \u2018OK, let's slow down. Let\u2019s make sure we can go in with the amount of evidence that we need.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of animosity,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt seems a mutual respect.\u201d",
      "Someone else Carisi has mutual respect for is his wife, Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish). Giddish has made a few guest appearances so far in Season 26.",
      "\u201cI have a feeling that you will see Rollins again,\u201d Scanavino says, adding, \u201cWhat a gift that is considering that Kelli Giddish is such an amazing actress and person.\u201d",
      "Until then, Scanavino is excited for fans to see what goes down this week.",
      "\u201cI think if you\u2019re a fan of either show, you\u2019re going to really love this,\u201d he says about the crossover. \u201cAnd if you love both shows, this is going to be a real mind-blowing event.\u201d",

      "Back on March 6, Los Angeles, California resident Jaela Bumpas posted a video to X showing the prank she and her husband pulled at a resort restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii to get a couple of free margaritas, and it went viral, garnering over 38 million views.",
      "It also amassed thousands of comments, with some comparing the action to \u201ctheft,\u201d while others felt like the couple just had a good \u201csense of humor.\u201d",
      "So, what did Jenna and Banks have to say about the prank?",
      "\u201cOK, so my mom had a birthday many years ago, and we were in Dubai with my man, and he proceeded to say her birthday was going on for two weeks,\u201d Banks said. \u201cAnd for two weeks, it was people coming in with flowers and cakes and the fire and the Champagne.\u201d",
      "Banks then hid her head in her hands in mock-embarrassment to show as she recalled the fibbery.",
      "\u201cSo guilty, family,\u201d she said. \u201cSuper guilty.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve done it,\u201d Jenna chimed in.",
      "\u201cYou have?\u201d Tyra exclaimed in surprise.",
      "\u201cWell, my cousin pretended to propose to me, which sounds nasty,\u201d Jenna said as laughter filled the room. A throwback photo is shown of Jenna and her cousin Sam LeBlond, who co-hosted in March.",
      "\u201cLook! That\u2019s us!\u201d she continued. \u201cWe look like a couple, don\u2019t we?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Banks said with a chuckle. \u201cHe looks like your cousin.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t 18. We did it kind of for laughs \u2014 and for dessert,\u201d Jenna said.",
      "Although an overwhelming majority of TODAY readers disagreed with faking a celebration to get something for free, Jenna remained unfazed.",
      "\u201cBy the way, everybody\u2019s faked a birthday,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re honest.\u201d"

      "Aimee Lou Wood is clearing up rumors that the tears she was spotted wiping away in public were due to jokes made about her on \"Saturday Night Live\" \u2014 which \"The White Lotus\" star previously condemned.",
      "Wood was spotted crying in the arms of Ralph Davis \u2014 who she is collaborating with on an upcoming project called \"Film Club\" \u2014 in the streets of London on April 14. Davis held Wood with one arm while she cried. In one photo, she turned her forehead to his chest as she sobbed, while multiple other photos captured her wiping away tears.",
      "Speculation immediately emerged that Wood's tears were due to a recent \"SNL\" sketch that mocked her teeth. However, on April 15, Wood posted on her Instagram story that she \"actually wasn't crying about anything that the papers made out. I was crying about something completely unrelated.\"",
      "Her message was written underneath a story repost from broadcaster and DJ Ashley Louise James, who was providing her support for Wood.",
      "\"Absolutely devastating to see another brilliant and talented actress reduced to tears because of people tearing into their appearance,\" James wrote.",
      "\"Women truly can't win. Embrace their natural beauty \u2014 get ripped apart. Alter their appearance to fit the very narrow ideas of beauty - get crucified. @aimeelouwood you are so beautiful. But more than that, you're an incredibly talented actor. A true talent. Shame on SNL for their cruelty. I'm so glad you spoke up.\"",
      "While Wood's story didn't note what she was crying about, it did clarify that she wasn't \"reduced to tears\" because of \"SNL,\" despite previously voicing her disappointment in a sketch that made fun of her.",
      "During the show's April 12 episode, \"SNL\" aired a skit called \"The White Potus,\" which placed President Donald J. Trump, his cabinet and family in the shoes of characters from the hit HBO show. While many of the characters modeled Trump or his administration, some were exaggerated versions of characters on the show.",
      "Cast member Sarah Sherman played Wood's character, Chelsea, in the skit with a set of fake teeth which were shown as Jon Hamm, who played Robert F. Kennedy Jr., discussed taking fluoride out of drinking water.",
      "On April 13, Wood posted a selfie on her Instagram story explaining her distaste for the spoof.",
      "\"But whilst in honest mode \u2014 I did find the SNL thing mean and unfunny xo,\" she wrote. \"(Felt righteous might delete later x).\"",
      "In another Instagram story, she expressed that she wished \"SNL\" went a \u201ccleverer, more nuanced, less cheap\u201d route when spoofing her character.",
      "\"I don\u2019t mind caricature \u2014 I understand that\u2019s what SNL is,\" she continued. \"But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.\"",
      "In following posts, Wood expressed that she's received \"thousands\" of supportive messages, along with an apology from \"SNL.\"",
      "\"On a positive note, everyone is agreeing with me about it so I\u2019m glad I said something instead of going in on myself,\" she wrote in a separate Instagram story.",
      "However, her co-star and on-screen love interest Walton Goggins praised \"SNL\" for the skit.",
      "\u201cHahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg,\u201d Goggins wrote in a since-deleted commented on the official \"SNL\" Instagram page.",

      "Back in 2021, the show fronted by former \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d star Christopher Meloni premiered as \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d on NBC, crossing over with \u201cSVU.\u201d It was the first time Meloni had returned to the \u201cL&O\u201d-verse since he\u2019d departed in 2011.",
      "Now, \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d is returning for a fifth season, with a shift over to Peacock. The first episode will also premiere April 17 on NBC at 10 p.m. ET after a new \u201cSVU\u201d episode in which Meloni makes a guest appearance.",
      "Trouble was brewing among the fractious Stabler brothers at the end of \u201cOC\u201d Season Four, with their personal drama bleeding over into Elliot Stabler's work life, and another Organized Crime Control Bureau detective was getting divorced after an affair with a co-worker.",
      "Things were, as they are often in \u201cOC\u201d land, rather unstable.",
      "But who\u2019s returning? What stories are expected? And who\u2019ll be the new kid on the block? Well, now that things are truly \u201corganized\u201d ahead of the premiere, let\u2019s meet our key players in Season Five.",
      "(Peacock is part of our parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Christopher Meloni (Detective Elliot Stabler)",
      "Last season, Elliot\u2019s family, which had always been a big part of his life, grew even bigger. With the addition of his brothers, Randall (Dean Norris) and Joe \"Joey\" Jr. (Michael Trotter), and return of Mama Bernadette \u201cBernie\u201d Stabler (Ellen Burstyn), in addition to Stabler's many children, in-laws and grandchildren, suddenly \u201cOC\u201d became a lot more like \u201cThe Stabler Clan.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe family is involved,\u201d Meloni told TODAY.com in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m always pushing for more of that. I like that dynamic and I think the audience does, too.\u201d",
      "Appearances by Stabler\u2019s children, whom he had with wife Kathy Stabler (Isabel Gillies) before her death in his 2021 return \u201cSVU\u201d episode, are also likely. But it's not yet clear when Maureen (Autumn Mirassou), Dickie (Jeffrey Scaperrotta), Lizzie (Kaitlyn Davidson) and Kathleen (Allison Siko) may pop up. The youngest of the bunch, daddy-to-be Eli (Nicky Torchia), can be seen in a photo from the new season, so expect some scenes with him.",
      "What\u2019s missing? A new life partner for the elder Stabler. Many fans want Capt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay, most often seen on \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d) to fill that role. Well, whether or not that will ever happens remains to be seen, but there is some good news for Bensler fans. Olivia will be coming over for a visit to \u201cOC\u201d in Episode Two of the new season.",
      "For those just coming into this aspect of the drama, Benson and Stabler were partners for many years on \u201cSVU,\u201d but Stabler left the \u201cL&O\u201d-verse after 12 seasons before coming back in 2021 for \u201cOC.\u201d While the two have never been in a romantic relationship, they\u2019re about as close as two people can be without having been in one.",
      "Meanwhile, Stabler continues to anticipate his next grandchild\u2019s arrival, throw himself into his work and keep his famous temper in check. (Last season he underwent a brief suspension after getting physical with a minor.)",
      "Danielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt (Sgt. Ayanna Bell)",
      "Stabler may be the focus in \u201cOC,\u201d but Bell leads the unit. Recently divorced and helping to raise her son, Jack, she\u2019s been in charge since the show debuted and oversees the cases with strong will and a cool head. (Much needed in this group.) She also partners with Stabler as well as supervising the unit \u2014 and last season ended up shot by a gang leader\u2019s son. (She\u2019s OK.)",
      "The new trailer for \u201cOC\u201d shows Bell sending Stabler undercover, which leads to him being injured as a truck smashes the vehicle he's driving. The repercussions of this incident are likely to reverberate throughout multiple episodes, so expect Bell to have big thoughts on that event.",
      "Season Five may be even more active for Bell. Truitt recently told TODAY.com that after feeling like the \u201cmama bear\u201d in the unit, she informed the showrunner at the time that she\u2019d like to do more than that. \u201cI feel like her function as a leader is beyond just trying to protect everybody all the time, and mothering everybody all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Ainsley Seiger (Detective Jet Slootmaekers)",
      "Solving crimes doesn\u2019t always happen on the street, which means the OC unit needs a brilliant computer hacker-type genius back in the office. For them, it\u2019s the youthful Slootmaekers, who can chase down elusive criminals for the unit. But Slootmaekers can go undercover with the best of them when needed.",
      "Seiger, whose character is also known for her deadpan sense of humor, occasionally posts pictures from the show on Instagram, and in February 2023 she wrote, \u201cCan\u2019t really articulate what this arc has meant to me so i will save it for my diary and maintain an air of mystery and allure.... but know that i am very very muchly grateful.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Slootmaekers and colleague Detective Bobby Reyes (Rick Gonzalez) began having a surprising affair, which was revealed early on in Season Four. The whole thing started while they were dealing with their grief after the death of their co-worker Detective Jamie Whelan (Brent Antonello), who died in the Season Three finale. The relationship fizzled out over the course of last season, and the two agreed to be friends.",
      "Rick Gonzalez (Detective Bobby Reyes)",
      "A former foster care child, Reyes wasn\u2019t an original member of the OC unit, but since he signed on in Season Three, he\u2019s become a fan favorite. The force works best when they have top undercover folks, and Reyes has proved to be just that \u2014 in more ways than one.",
      "Called \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d by his co-workers because of his ability to transform into whatever deep cover character he needs to be, he first met the others in the unit by pretending to be an electrician at the interview, listening in on their discussion of the investigation \u2014 then announced himself. That\u2019s a way to make an entrance!",
      "\u201cHe can be nobody and everybody at the same time, and that\u2019s going to be useful for the unit,\u201d Gonazalez told TODAY.com in 2022.",
      "That said, Reyes\u2019 undercover activities were a bit more figurative early in Season Four, when viewers learned that he \u2014 a married man \u2014 slept with co-worker Slootmaekers. They called off the affair shortly after. He later revealed he\u2019d signed divorce papers and took a leave of absence.",
      "Dean Norris (Randall Stabler)",
      "Divorced and until recently living in Florida, Randall visited his younger brother Elliot in Season Four, helping out at a family dinner with much of the extended Stabler family attending. But the brothers started arguing when Randall revealed the real reason he left home when Elliot was younger. Randall explained he was the one who called Internal Affairs on their dad, Joe Sr., a former police officer, to inform them about \"all the nastiness\" Joe Sr. was involved in. When Elliot asked why, Randall said their father used to beat their mother \u201con a nightly basis.\u201d",
      "Randall also got caught up in Elliot's work life after they learned younger brother Joe Jr. got caught up in drugs with a bad group of men, and the two tried staged an intervention for their brother.",
      "In Season Five, Randall will also cross paths with another person close to Elliot: Benson.",
      "Norris joked in an interview with TODAY.com that Elliot is \"nervous that Randall might be trying to hit on Benson.\"",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s feeling a little jealous,\u201d Norris continues. \u201cI think me and Mariska have a little thing. I mean, just saying!\u201d",
      "The first two episodes of \"Law & Order: Organized Crime\" Season Five premiere April 17 on Peacock. New episodes will stream weekly."

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should end his \u201cpolitical\u201d war in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home, former leaders of the Mossad intelligence agency and members of the military told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Unless Netanyahu changes \"his attitude and his strategy, I think that to achieve an agreement will be very difficult,\u201d Danny Yatom, who served as head of the Mossad, said Tuesday in a telephone interview.",
      "Yatom, who was also then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak\u2019s chief of staff and security adviser, is one several former leaders of the spy agency who backed a series of open letters to the Israeli government.",
      "The former members of the military and the intelligence community, as well as reservists, are demanding an end to the war in Gaza in return for the release of at least 59 hostages who remain in captivity there.",
      "Less than half are believed to still be alive, according to Israeli officials.",
      "After another letter signed by nearly\u00a01,000 Israeli Air Force reservists\u00a0and retirees was published in Israeli media on Thursday, the army said it would fire anyone who added their name to it. It did not specify how many people that included or if the firings had begun.",
      "Hamas has maintained that it will not agree to a deal that does not include the promise of a complete end to the war in Gaza, which began after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "More than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of a three-part ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 of Palestinian prisoners \u2014 ended on March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces shattered the fragile truce last month and has since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Yatom said it was clear to many that \u201cthe targets of Netanyahu are different than the targets of the society, of the Israeli society.\u201d",
      "\"His main priority is to remain prime minister,\" Yatom said, adding that his prime minister's fragile government coalition relies on the support of far-right lawmakers like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom have threatened to withdraw support if the military campaign ends in Gaza.",
      "Citing his opposition to the truce, Ben-Gvir resigned from the Israeli government in January after the original ceasefire deal was announced. He returned to the Cabinet shortly after Israeli forces resumed their operations in Gaza.",
      "Eran Duvdevani, a retired colonel with the Israel Defense Forces who helped to organize a separate letter signed by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers, said that Israel had agreed to the original ceasefire deal \"and now, it's as if there's zero willingness to agree to an end to the war.\"",
      "\u201cEven though Hamas did horrific things on Oct. 7, you don\u2019t go to war for revenge.\u201d he said.",
      "With the Trump administration's backing, Netanyahu appears to \"feel that he can do whatever (he) wants.\" Duvdevani said. \u201cThis should not be the way.\u201d"

It added that medicines were rapidly running out.",
      "Israel has maintained amid mounting criticism over its aid blockade that there is \"no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip\" after it allowed the entry of thousands of trucks into the enclave during the ceasefire.

Israel's ensuing offensive has killed more than 50,800 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 according to health officials in the Gaza Strip, and destroyed much of the enclave. More than 50 hostages remain in Gaza, both dead and alive.",
      "Efforts to renegotiate and resume the ceasefire have so far proved fruitless, with each side blaming the other."

      "Trump temporarily drops tariffs to 10% for most countries, hits China harder with 125%",
      "Trump open to tariff negotiations, contradicting White House aides",
      "Based on the tariffs currently in place, and including a 90-day suspension of \u201creciprocal tariffs,\u201d the volume of world merchandise trade is now expected to decline by 0.2% in 2025, before posting a \u201cmodest\u201d recovery of 2.5% in 2026.",
      "The decline is anticipated to be particularly steep in North America, where exports are forecasted to drop by 12.6% this year.",
      "The WTO also warned that \u201csevere downside risks exist,\u201d including the application of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs and a broader spillover of policy uncertainty, \u201cwhich could lead to an even sharper decline of 1.5% in global goods trade,\u201d particularly hurting export-oriented, least-developed countries.",
      "The recent tariff disturbances follow a strong year for world trade in 2024, during which merchandise trade grew 2.9% and commercial services trade expanded by 6.8%, the WTO said.",
      "The new estimate of a 0.2% decline in world trade for 2025 is nearly three percentage points lower than it would have been under a \u201clow tariff\u201d baseline scenario, the WTO added, and marks a significant reversal from the start of the year when the trade body\u2019s economists expected to see continued trade expansion supported by improving macroeconomic conditions.",
      "\u201cRisks to the forecast include the implementation of the currently suspended reciprocal tariffs by the United States, as well as a broader spillover of trade policy uncertainty beyond U.S.-linked trade relationships,\u201d the WTO said.",
      "\u201cIf enacted, reciprocal tariffs would reduce world merchandise trade growth by an additional 0.6 percentage points, posing particular risks for least-developed countries (LDCs), while a spreading of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) would shave off a further 0.8 percentage points. Taken together, the reciprocal tariffs and spreading TPU would lead to a 1.5% decline in world merchandise trade volume in 2025.\u201d",
      "Trump stunned trading partners and global markets in early April, when he announced a raft of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries.

China in turn hit back at Washington with retaliatory tariffs of\u00a0up to 125% on U.S. imports.",
      "Widespread market turbulence following the tariffs announcement prompted a temporary climbdown by Trump, with the president last week announcing that\u00a0the new duties on imports from most trading partners would be reduced to 10% for 90 days\u00a0in order to allow for\u00a0trade negotiations\u00a0with Washington\u2019s counterparts.",
      "The WTO said in its Wednesday report that the impact of recent trade policy changes is likely to vary sharply from region to region.",
      "In the adjusted forecast, North America now subtracts 1.7 percentage points from global merchandise trade growth in 2025, turning the overall figure negative.",
      "Meanwhile, Asia and Europe continue to contribute positively, but less than in the baseline scenario, with Asia\u2019s input halved to 0.6 percentage points.",
      "The disruption in U.S.-China trade is expected \u201cto trigger significant trade diversion,\u201d the WTO added, raising concerns among third markets about increased competition from China.",
      "\u201cChinese merchandise exports are projected to rise by 4% to 9% across all regions outside North America as trade is redirected. At the same time, U.S. imports from China are expected to fall sharply in sectors such as textiles, apparel and electrical equipment, creating new export opportunities for other suppliers able to fill the gap,\u201d the trade organization remarked, noting that this could open the door for some least-developed countries to increase their exports to the U.S. market."

      "\u201cGiven President Donald Trump\u2019s norm-shattering approach to his second term, it\u2019s no surprise that Australians are less trusting of the United States,\u201d said Ryan Neelam, the Lowy Institute\u2019s Director of Public Opinion and Foreign Policy.",

      "\"The Great Moose Migration\" started airing Tuesday on SVT, Sweden's public service television company. It captures the creatures on the path they've followed for thousands of years to rich summer grazing pastures.",
      "The show will air nonstop for 20 days, following the moose via remote cameras and drones as they journey through forests and swim across the \u00c5ngerman River,\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "The series debuted in 2019 on SVT Play and drew about a million viewers in its first year. Last year, viewership exploded to 9 million.",
      "And its fan base is dedicated and massive.",
      "\"I make sure I have coffee, I have snacks. Sleep? Forget it, I don't sleep,\" Ulla Malmgren, 62, said in an interview that aired Wednesday on NBC News' \"TODAY\" show.",
      "A Facebook group titled \u201cVi som gillar den stora \u00e4lgvandringen p\u00e5 SVT!\u201d \u2014 which translates to \u201cWe who like the great moose migration on SVT!\u201d \u2014 has over 78,000 members, with fans sharing photos of their TV screens when moose appear.",
      "Locals keep the show playing on their TVs as hours can go by without any action, and when moose appear, they explode in joy.",

      "The show is an example of the wild success of slow TV \u2014 no plots, no drama, just a front-row seat to Mother Nature. The Giant Panda Cam at the National Zoo, which has attracted over 100 million fans, and the Bald Eagle Cam at Big Bear Valley in California are other examples of the phenomenon.",
      "\"Everyone is so stressed today with the social media and the way we produce everything we do in our life, and this is the total opposite of that,\" Johan Erlag, project manager at SVT, said on \"TODAY.\"",
      "Annette Hill, a media and communications professor at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, said, \"It gives us a really distinctive type of atmosphere, an almost therapeutic slow atmosphere, and at the same time it helps us to adjust our mood.\"",
      "Producers of the livestream said they had to start shooting a week earlier than planned because of warm weather that bumped up the migration.\u00a0But fear not \u2014 with three weeks left on the migration journey, there's plenty of time to tune in."

      "According to a study from Barcelona\u2019s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, the number of Chinese students taking its translation and language science classes has risen 37% from five years ago, but China\u2019s formal educational resources for learning Spanish are far less developed than they are for learning English.",
      "Instead, students are turning to social media sites and streaming services such as NetEase Cloud Music (NECM) to engage with digital language content, with translations of reggaeton songs garnering millions of views on the platform.",
      "The UPF study, which was published last month in the journal \u201cLanguage and Intercultural Communication,\u201d says that amateur translators often collaborate with Latin music lovers on the popular streaming site, using various \u201cintercultural mediation strategies\u201d to make it easier for the Chinese public to understand some of reggaeton\u2019s more niche or idiomatic Spanish cultural references without Chinese equivalents.",
      "The report says that around 2 in 3 translators get past the barriers of language and culture by swapping Spanish expressions with other Chinese imagery. The expression \u201cget stood up,\u201d for example, becomes \u201cfree[ing] a dove\u201d \u2014 a Chinese expression for breaking a promise.",
      "Even after they\u2019ve cleared cultural hurdles, users wanting to spread hits such as \u201cDespacito\u201d and \u201cGasolina\u201d to Guangzhou and Chengdu then need to satisfy China\u2019s censors.",
      "As with TikTok, certain words and phrases are redacted on Chinese social media, especially those containing sexual references, which regularly come up in reggaeton songs.",
      "While asterisks placed between Chinese characters by translators can help bypass this censorship, Mandarin phrases and characters are usually not separated by spaces as they are in English. That means starring out frowned-upon language can alter the meanings of lyrics and add an extra challenge to translators.",
      "Using cultural output such as French cinema or Italian cooking is a language learning method that has long been deployed by teachers the world over. Spreading reggaeton to China may be helping drive an interest in Spanish culture \u2014 at least at UPF anyway.",
      "The university's cohort of Chinese students has grown by almost a third to 275 in the past five years.",

      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said he had instructed law enforcement to step up protection of staff and\u00a0prisons.",

      "China has for the first time publicly accused three hackers of working for the National Security Agency and offered a reward for information leading to their arrest, echoing tactics the U.S. routinely uses against alleged Chinese cyberspies.",
      "The accusations are an escalation in the ongoing cyber conflict between the two countries, one long feared by U.S. intelligence officers. It comes as President Donald Trump wages a trade war with China, and in the wake of the U.S. accusing China of two of the largest hacking campaigns against American infrastructure in history.",
      "While there is little doubt that the NSA conducts cyber espionage against Chinese targets, China provided little evidence for its claims.",
      "In an emailed statement, White House National Security Council spokesperson Kylie Newbold said: \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party needs to stop with these fabrications. If they want to engage in useful conversations they can pick up the phone and call. Instead of engaging productively, China continues unfair trade practices and retaliation to hurt the United States and our workers. The CCP also continues to claim false equivalence to excuse its own bad acts in cyberspace.\u201d",
      "The NSA did not respond to requests for comment, and NBC News was unable to immediately determine if the NSA currently employs people with the names China made public.",
      "The claims were published Tuesday in a report by China\u2019s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC), a Chinese organization that tracks cyber threats to the country; echoed by the country\u2019s primary law enforcement agency, the Ministry of Public Security; and amplified by state media organizations.",
      "The CVERC report largely focuses on claims that the NSA hacked digital infrastructure to spy on the Asian Winter Games, held in February in the Chinese city of Harbin, but include few technical details.",
      "Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a news conference Tuesday: \u201cThe nature of these actions is extremely malicious, and China condemns the U.S. government\u2019s malicious cyber activities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe urge the U.S. to adopt a responsible attitude on cybersecurity issues, stop cyberattacks on China, and cease unwarranted smears and attacks against China,\u201d he said.",
      "For more than a decade, the U.S. has indicted accused hackers working for intelligence services in China, as well as in Russia, Iran and North Korea. While it\u2019s extremely unlikely those countries would ever turn over their own officers to the United States, the \u201cname and shame\u201d tactic has served as a means of intimidation to those accused hackers, hoping to disrupt their operations and prevent them from traveling to countries abroad that cooperate with U.S. law enforcement.",
      "Chinese law enforcement also offered an unspecified financial reward for information leading to the arrest of the alleged NSA hackers. The U.S. routinely offers substantial bounties on accused foreign hackers through its Rewards for Justice program.",
      "Tuesday is China\u2019s National Security Education Day, a holiday established in 2015 by China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping. Dakota Cary, a China analyst at the cybersecurity company SentinelOne, told NBC News that the timing of the accusations indicates they\u2019re less oriented toward curbing U.S. hackers\u2019 behavior \u2014 the stated reason for the U.S. employing such tactics \u2014 and more toward scoring a propaganda victory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re celebrating a holiday by putting out this piece. For me this says a lot about what the purpose of the claims are,\u201d Cary said."
