      "LOS ANGELES -- Fifty years ago, the music mogul Clive Davis threw a party to celebrate the release of Arista Records\u2019 first Grammy record of the year nominee: Barry Manilow\u2019s \u201cMandy.\u201d Stevie Wonder showed up. So did John Denver and Elton John.",
      "What was a one-off celebration for an enduring hit morphed into one of the best-known and most exclusive parties of the year: the annual pre-Grammy fundraising event hosted by Davis, held every year on the Saturday before the Sunday award show.",
      "At the 2025 benefit gala, once again held at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, California, Manilow performed his 1975 classic. He was introduced with a short video depicting him doing the same five decades prior.",
      "\u201cCan you believe I looked like that,\" Manilow joked after attendees watched both versions. \"Can you believe Clive looked like that?\u201d",
      "There was a lot to celebrate across five decades, but in the direct aftermath of the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires that destroyed more than 14,000 structures and displaced tens of thousands of people, efforts to raise awareness and donations punctuated the night.",
      "A QR code was placed at every table and flashed on screens to encourage contributions to the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity to aid the relief efforts. The evening, infamous for running into the wee hours of the morning, concluded at a respectable 11:30 p.m. to avoid distracting from the cause.",
      "\u201cThis one is a little different,\u201d Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in his opening remarks. \u201cWe knew we could use this platform\u201d to honor first responders and celebrate \u201cthe resilience of this community.\u201d",
      "Since launching LA wildfire relief efforts, the academy has raised \u201calmost $5 million in aid,\" he announced.",
      "The tonal shift came as no surprise. The annual event was one of the few 2025 Grammy week events not canceled due to the fires.",
      "Many performers and industry veterans used their time on stage to drive attention to relief efforts.",
      "\u201cPlease take care of the people kicking ass on the front lines, the first responders,\" the charismatic Post Malone said after a stripped-down arrangement of his 2018 track \u201cSunflower,\u201d the first double-diamond certified single at 20x platinum, which he described as his \u201conly good song.\u201d",
      "Sets were a mix of legendary talent, like Joni Mitchell moving some to tears with \u201cBoth Sides Now,\" and newer voices including Samara Joy and the 2025 best new artist nominees Doechii, Shaboozey, Teddy Swims and Benson Boone, the latter of which ended his performance with an athletic flip.",
      "Sprinkled throughout the performances were tributes to the late, great producer Quincy Jones.",
      "Michael Bubl\u00e9 covered \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d Jennifer Hudson belted through Aretha Franklin's \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d and gospel singer Yolanda Adams ended the night with a powerfully heartfelt rendition of Whitney Houston's \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d",
      "Jody Gerson, chairman and CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group, was honored with the 2025 Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award at the star-studded event.",
      "\u201cI have a confession. There were a few times early in my career where I crashed this party,\u201d she said, noting she received her first invitation in the early 2000s and being honored \u201cdeeply, deeply touched\u201d her.",
      "\u201cMusic can brighten our darkest days,\u201d Gerson said. \u201cAnd we need artists to bring light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "Gerson has broken the glass ceiling throughout her career. She is the first chairwoman of a global music company and the first woman named CEO of a major music publisher. The long list of superstars she has worked with include Malone, Bad Bunny, Justin Bieber, Lana Del Rey, Ariana Grande, Coldplay, Drake, Billie Eilish, Elton John, Kendrick Lamar and, of course, Taylor Swift.",
      "\u201cShe is a true industry icon who rightly deserves celebration,\u201d said Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge, who introduced Gerson. \u201cShe has completely transformed Universal Music Group publishing.\u201d",
      "Gaining admittance to Davis\u2019 event is notoriously challenging. The A-listers who made the cut this year included Jennifer Lopez, Babyface, Gayle King, Nancy Pelosi, Jack Antonoff, TEMS, Willow Smith, Berry Gordy, Paris Hilton, Alicia Keys, Swizz Beatz, Diane Warren, Gracie Abrams, John Stamos and Justin Tranter.",
      "Who wouldn't want a ticket to \u201cClive Davis' bar mitzvah,\" comedian Jimmy Kimmel asked before announcing the man of the hour.",
      "\u201cHe's a living legend,\" Kimmel said.",
      "Considering Davis' singular influence in the music industry through his work with Houston, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few, it was no wonder so many were excited to attend. But this year, the gala was less of a party and more of a reflection of what can happen when the music industry comes together to support each other and the community after a disaster."

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

    "summary": "Film wasn&rsquo;t the only thing on people&rsquo;s minds at this year&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
    "story": [
      "Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah ( and online ).",
      "The effects of the wildfires in Southern California loomed large, as did the bittersweet knowledge that this year will be the second to last Sundance based in Park City. Some films offered an escape from reality; others were a pointed reminder of the domestic and international political landscape, from transgender rights to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the 41st edition of the festival.",
      "The wildfires were still burning in parts of Los Angeles when Sundance began last week and reminders of its devastation were everywhere, even on screen. Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s \u201cRebuilding,\u201d starring Josh O\u2019Connor as a cowboy who loses his ranch in a wildfire and forms a community with fellow survivors in a FEMA camp, hit close to home for many.",
      "Filmmakers Meena Menon and Paul Gleason lost their home in Altadena where they filmed some of their zombie apocalypse movie \u201cDidn\u2019t Die.\u201d Sundance artist labs head Michelle Satter lost her Palisades home as well. Satter had an audience of Sundance Institute donors in tears early in the festival while accepting an honor at a fundraising gala.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply devastating time for us and so many others, a moment that calls for all of us coming together to support our bigger community,\u201d Satter said. \u201cAs a friend recently noted, and I have to listen to this, \u2018Take a deep breath ... We lost our village, but at the end of the day we are the village.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was a topic bound to come up in nearly every conversation: The festival\u2019s new home in 2027. \u201cWhere do you think it will go? How do you feel about it leaving Park City? What would Sundance in Ohio even look like?\u201d No one had any answers, but everyone had an opinion about the fact that next year will be the last year in which the center of activity is in Park City. Sundance Institute leadership has narrowed the finalist cities to Salt Lake City, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and is expected to announce the winner before spring.",
      "Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the institute\u2019s board, was hopeful about a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that\u2019s evergreen,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRegardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d",
      "In the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, politics were also a main topic of private discussions at least. Several films (mostly documentaries) had direct relevance to recent news, like \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about transgender lawyer Chase Strangio and the media coverage of transgender issues amid a pending Supreme Court case.",
      "Even \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d filmmaker Bill Condon quoted Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo genders\u201d mandate before his film screened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a sentiment I think you\u2019ll see that the movie has a different point of view on,\u201d Condon said.",
      "There also wasn\u2019t the spirit of public protest that was unavoidable eight years ago when Trump first took office, when A-listers took to the streets to march for women's rights. But audiences at Q&As for films like \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about the abusive Alabama prison systems which the AP has reported extensively on, were curious how they could help change things.",
      "There have been essentially two major deals out of the festival so far: Netflix took \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d Clint Bentley\u2019s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation, with Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, and Neon acquired the Dave Franco and Alison Brie relationship body horror \u201cTogether.\u201d",
      "As always, some films came in with distribution in place: Focus Features with \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d; A24 with \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You,\u201d \u201cOpus,\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d; Bleecker Street with \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Nat Geo with the Sally Ride documentary \u201cSally\u201d; MUBI with \u201cMagic Farm\u201d; and Apple with \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d; HBO Documentary Films with \u201cThe Alabama Solution\u201d and \u201cEnigma.\u201d",
      "Most deals happen after the festival ends, but there have been private grumblings that the market this year was weaker than usual, and the films were not commercial enough. Several insiders singled out Condon\u2019s adaptation of \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d with Jennifer Lopez as being too expensive for anyone but a streaming service. But there are also plenty of deals in the works, some of which will be finalized soon, while others may be settled at the Berlin Film Festival market.",
      "As festival programmers like to say, Sundance isn\u2019t the end of the story for new films \u2014 it\u2019s just the beginning. Last year\u2019s program had over 100 films distributed to audiences through traditional means, and only a small fraction of those were announced during the festival.",
      "Perhaps the biggest discovery of the festival is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d from writer-director-star Eva Victor in her feature debut. This funny and quietly piercing film is about Agnes, who was sexually assaulted by her thesis advisor. Instead of making it about depicting the incident itself (Victor keeps the camera firmly planted outside of the home where it occurs, showing the passage of time through light), Victor, who could be the next Greta Gerwig and/or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stays focused on how it affects Anges.",
      "Filmmaker James Sweeney also scored a big win with \u201cTwinless,\u201d which picked up the U.S. dramatic audience prize and a special award for his star Dylan O\u2019Brien. The movie is about a bromance between two men in a twin bereavement group.",
      "On the documentary side there was much chatter about \u201cAndr\u00e9 Is an Idiot,\u201d a documentary about a \u201cbrilliant idiot\u201d who is dying because he didn\u2019t get a colonoscopy and trying to live out his final days happily.",
      "The in-person experience at Sundance is also a good reminder that reviews are only part of the equation when it comes to judging the response to a film. Hailey Gates\u2019 war satire \u201cAtropia\u201d got mixed reviews from critics, but premiere audiences were very enthusiastic (as was the U.S. dramatic jury who gave it the festival\u2019s top prize ).",
      "As of publication, all are still seeking distribution.",
      "Others that played notably well with audiences and critics include: \u201cIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d \u201cDJ Ahmet,\u201d \u201cCactus Pears,\u201d \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d \u201cPlainclothes,\u201d \u201cRicky,\u201d \u201cPrime Minister,\u201d \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d\u201cSLY LIVES!,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d \u201cPredators,\u201d \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d \u201cFolktales,\u201d \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d and \u201cTrain Dreams.\u201d",

      "There have been plenty of out-of-the-ordinary moments at the ongoing trial of rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trial of rapper A$AP Rocky is progressing according to standard legal procedure, but there have been no lack of unusual moments, from visits from Rihanna to a tough-but-quirky judge and lawyers nearly coming to blows.",
      "Testimony is expected to last another week before jurors will decide Rocky's fate on two counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm. A conviction could lead to up to 24 years in prison for the hip-hop star.",
      "Here are some of the out-of-the-ordinary moments from the first two weeks of the trial, most not captured by the cameras in the courtroom.",
      "From the moment it became clear the case was going to trial, nearly everyone involved was asking the same thing: What about Rihanna?",
      "Editors asked it of reporters, who asked it of lawyers. Even Judge Mark Arnold asked it months ago at a hearing: \u201cWill the mother of his children be there?\u201d",
      "Her name came up constantly during jury selection, when prospective panelists were asked whether her attendance would affect their judgment.",
      "Yet when the singing superstar finally did show up, she was easy to miss.",
      "She didn't appear through the first week, but rumors abounded Wednesday that she might appear, on a short court day with important testimony. Yet there was no sign of her outside or in the halls. (Unlike a nearby civil courthouse, where celebrities like Britney Spears and the Kardashians are smuggled in, Rocky and other defendants must use public entrances and many thought she'd accompany him.)",
      "When the media were allowed in the courtroom, many reporters walked past her without noticing she was already sitting inconspicuously between Rocky's mother and sister. She had been brought in through restricted entrances. She could barely be seen from the media section, and the camera capturing the trial is not allowed to shoot the audience.",
      "Her presence caused a quiet stir once the audience realized it, though it's not clear if the jurors had noticed her.",
      "She appeared again the next day, and it soon felt almost unexceptional that she was there. By Friday, she slipped in about 30 minutes into testimony after coming through a public entrance.",
      "Later that day she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time, down a hallway full of jurors from his and other cases that was abuzz.",
      "Court observers knew that when Deputy District Attorney John Lewin joined the prosecution shortly before trial, that he and Rocky's equally bullish and vocal attorney, Joe Tacopina, were sure to butt heads. They weren't wrong.",
      "Lewin, a dogged prosecutor, is best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate heir Robert Durst. Tacopina is a New York attorney and frequent TV commentator whose clients have included President Donald Trump.",
      "Their shouting matches began quickly. Soon, without judge or jury present, the two had to be separated by a fellow lawyer when they went nose-to-nose in a faceoff that looked like it might become a fistfight.",
      "\u201cMr. Tacopina started literally screaming at me in the courtroom. He basically appeared to challenge me to a fight,\u201d Lewin told the judge later.",
      "Tacopina responded. \u201cNo one screamed. You weren\u2019t there your honor. Mr. Lewin comes up with his little scolding, bullying attitude.\u201d",
      "Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, forbade the two from talking to each other except on the record.",
      "Moments later, he said a UFC fight might be warranted. \u201cMaybe we should get an octagon.\u201d",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong either. An even more fierce fight broke out between the two men in front of the judge but off camera a few days later as they argued over evidence. Lewin shouted that the defense assertion Rocky was carrying a prop gun was \u201cgarbage.\"",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh?!\u201d Tacopina yelled. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "\"The argument grew more out of control and turned to personal insults.",
      "\u201cYou don't know me! But you will learn!\u201d Tacopina yelled.",
      "The judge, disgusted, refused to keep playing referee.",
      "\u201cThat's it, we're off the record,\u201d he said, and walked out.",
      "The testimony of A$AP Relli, Rocky's accuser, was dark and difficult but brought a couple of oddly light moments.",
      "At one point, Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec asked him how far away Rocky was at a certain moment.",
      "\u201cAbout three or four skips,\" Relli said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard about anyone estimating with skips,\u201d Przelomiec said.",
      "\u201cWait, what does a skip mean?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean?\u201d Relli asked.",
      "They determined for the record that it was about 7 to 8 feet.",
      "Arnold's long-for-a-judge hair and rugged, bushy mustache evoke a biker, or a cowboy. His nameplate on the bench is a carved wooden log. Relli let him know he liked his style.",
      "As he testified, Arnold told him he clearly had to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for the court reporter.",
      "Relli said sorry, he was nervous, then looking at the judge said, \u201cI like your bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat?\u201d Arnold said.",
      "Relli pointed at the silver wristband on the judge's right arm. \u201cYour bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s mother, Renee Black, and his sister, Erika Mayers, garnered their own share of attention even before Rihanna sat between them.",
      "The first day they appeared, Arnold asked Rocky who the women in his section were.",
      "\u201cThat's my mother and my sister,\u201d Rocky said. The judge's marveled at Black's youthful appearance.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat\u2019s on the record.\u201d",
      "Later, Lewin politely approached the women and talked to them during a break. He said of Rocky, \u201cI just hope he's evaluating everything\u201d in a reference to the deal Rocky turned down \u2014 a recommendation of 180 days in jail and other relatively minor punishments for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Tacopina angrily brought it up to the judge later, and Lewin explained himself.",
      "\u201cI walked up very kindly to the defendants mother and sister. I said \u2018I am very sorry you have to go through this. I hope that your brother and your son, he\u2019s really evaluated what he\u2019s risking here.\u2019\u201d",

      "She pointed to a door with a small window behind the judge, who pounced into action, his robe flying. He and his clerk opened the door and hurried down the hall behind it, but found no one.",

      "\u201cYou did the right thing!\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou done good!\u201d",
      "They kept the window covered after that."

      "So what if the Dead owns just two Grammys, for lifetime achievement in 2007 and best music film in 2018. They made their mark with a unique style and long improvisations blending such genres as rock, blues, jazz, folk and psychedelia.",
      "\u201cLongevity was never a major concern of ours,\u201d 77-year-old guitarist Bob Weir said, drawing laughs. \u201cSpreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\u201d",

      "The 24-year-old influencer, who has over 162 million followers, rose to fame with charming videos of his reactions to everyday life in which he never says a word. His following surged during the pandemic, when he was fired from his factory job and used the extra time on his hands to make and upload more videos.",

      "Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, was kidnapped by JNIM, a branch of al-Qaida in Africa's Sahel region, while on his way to interview one of the group's leaders in northern Mali",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For a foreign correspondent in Mali, the assignment seemed like a dream: as Islamic extremists upended the region, Olivier Dubois, a French journalist, secured a rare interview with a leader of JNIM, an al-Qaida\u2019s affiliate in the Sahel.",
      "Or so he thought. En route to the interview in Gao, northern Mali, in April 2021, Dubois, a correspondent for Lib\u00e9ration and Jeune Afrique publications, was kidnapped.",
      "He spent 711 days in desert captivity, sleeping chained to a tree, eating dried goat meat and plotting his escape. Nearly two years after his release, he recounts his ordeal in a book released Thursday in France that draws heavily on notes Dubois secretly kept during his captivity, written on any scrap of paper he could find.",
      "\u201cOne of the main factors that helped me resist and survive was telling myself that I am a journalist,\u201d Dubois told The Associated Press in the first interview for English-language media since his release. \"Let\u2019s continue to gather information, let\u2019s continue to ask questions and pretend I\u2019m working.\"",
      "The Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in recent years have been upended by military coups and are now led by military juntas, which struggle against rising extremist violence and have made kidnappings a cornerstone of their strategy in the region.",
      "Upon his release, French media published an investigation revealing that Dubois's fixer had worked with French intelligence, who used him to locate the extremist leader he was trying to interview.",
      "Dubois told the AP he knew his project was risky, but that he trusted his fixer too much and ignored the warning signs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said of the circumstances surrounding his kidnapping. \u201cI think it was a betrayal. But the motive for the betrayal is not yet clear. I have not spoken to my fixer since I have been released.\u201d",
      "Kidnappings have skyrocketed in the Sahel in recent years, according to data from the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED.",
      "JNIM, the Sahelian branch of al-Qaida, has been responsible for most of the 1,468 kidnappings in Sahel and Benin between 2017 and 2025, according to the ACLED. The group relies on ransom money to fund their operations and on the fear they instill on local populations to keep them in check.",
      "Dubois recalled being told he would be \"released quickly\u201d if his family and government did as instructed.",
      "Dubois was released on March 20, 2023, in Agadez, Niger, but details of his release, including whether a ransom was paid, remain undisclosed.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron took to the social platform X to write \u201cOlivier Dubois is free,\" but he did not elaborate on the conditions of the release.",
      "Speaking to the AP, Dubois said that he did not know the details either, but he recalled being told by the rebels that ransoms varied by nationality. As a French citizen, he was worth 10 million euros, he was told. A South African was worth 50 million.",
      "Having covered numerous hostage stories in the region, Dubois knew that even if freed, his ordeal could be lengthy.",
      "In order to stay sane, he became obsessed with plotting an escape. But after the fourth unsuccessful attempt, his captors staged a mock execution and threatened to kill him if he tried again. So instead, Dubois started reading the Quran.",
      "Reading the holy book of Islam served a dual purpose: it occupied his mind, and helped him understand his captors better, be able to discuss with them and build a relationship, so they could treat him more as a human being and less as an anonymous hostage.",
      "Unexpectedly, it also put him on a more spiritual path.",
      "\"I am a former atheist, then an agnostic who thought I\u2019d stop there,\u201d he said. \u201cReading the Quran made me want to read other religious texts. This captivity has been the beginning of a journey that will perhaps lead me to God \u2014 or not.\u201d",
      "Now that his book \u2014 \u201cPrisonnier du d\u00e9sert, 711 jours aux mains d\u2019Al-Qa\u00efda,\u201d which translates in English into \u201cPrisoner of the desert, 711 days in the hands of Al-Qaida\u201d \u2014 is out, Dubois said he was hoping he was ready to go back to journalism and move on.",
      "But the experience still haunts him.",
      "\u201cIt was painful labour,\u201d he said of the writing process. \u201cThe first reflex after finishing it was to distance myself from the story, hoping time will pass and, maybe, all of that will be behind me. But I don't really know if that's possible.\u201d"

      "Relli had testified under prosecution questioning that his hand felt hot when Rocky fired at him on a Hollywood street and his hand was grazed. A photo was shown of scrapes that had torn the skin on his knuckles.",
      "He did not seek medical attention until two days later in New York.",
      "\u201cYou waited to fly all the way across country before seeking medical attention?\u201d defense attorney Joe Tacopina asked.",
      "\u201cI had my hand wrapped that night,\u201d Relli said, then acknowledged he had.",
      "He said that after the incident, \u201cI didn't trust LA. I didn't trust nobody.\u201d",
      "Through their opening statement and the cross-examination, Rocky's attorneys have suggested Relli only sought medical attention because the lawyer in a separate civil case where he's seeking money from the rapper, told him he should.",
      "Relli at first denied that he had been acting on his lawyer's advice, but later conceded after hearing his previous testimony.",
      "\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about getting the police involved, your endgame was getting money from Rocky, correct?\u201d Tacopina asked.",
      "Relli answered, \u201cNo. I wanted protection. I wasn\u2019t sure it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Tacopina also challenged him about the short time he spent at the hospital.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one hour and 36 minutes for a gunshot, yeah?\u201d the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cIt was two days later,\u201d Relli replied.",
      "Anticipating the defense tactic, the prosecution told jurors during their opening statement that for the charges in the case \u2014 two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 it doesn't matter whether Relli was injured.",
      "Relli appeared angry and frustrated throughout the testimony. He constantly asked if questions were relevant, muttered to himself, and had to be instructed by the judge to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d After listening to two different recordings of phone calls the defense said were him, he declared both were fake.",
      "Guilty findings on both counts could lead to a maximum of 24 years in prison for Rocky.",
      "That verdict could be a major turning point in the life of the rapper, who this weekend is nominated for his third Grammy Award at a ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles from the trial.",
      "Rocky's attorneys are arguing, in a revelation made just before the trial began, that the gun he fired was a starter pistol that carried only blanks that he had just as a prop for security. They allege Relli knew this.",
      "Relli testified under prosecution questioning that he had not known Rocky to carry a gun.",
      "When Tacopina returned to the question, Relli hedged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really chill with him every day, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the time I chill with him, I don\u2019t know him carrying guns.\u201d",
      "Tacopina continued, \u201cWell one thing you know, is for sure he doesn't carry a prop gun.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho carries a prop gun?\u201d Relli answered. \u201cWho\u2019s going to come to a situation and carry a prop gun?\u201d",
      "After the jury was dismissed for lunch, a vicious argument broke out between Tacopina and Deputy District Attorney John Lewin over a racy photo of Relli's girlfriend that he showed Relli to identify her.",
      "Lewin argued it was an attempt to inflame the witness, and that the defense's entire case failed to address the actual incident, including \u201cthis prop gun garbage!\u201d",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh!?\u201d Tacopina shouted back. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "Tacopina then called Relli a perjurer, and said that the prosecutors were abetting him.",
      "As it got even louder and more personal, the judge, who seemed disgusted, walked out.",
      "He had previously instructed the men, who have butted heads often, only to talk to each other on the record. In this case they were, though the cameras had been turned off.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers.",

      "Superstar singer Rihanna made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, and may have outshined key testimony in the case",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The most important testimony at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky got second billing as the defendant\u2019s partner and the mother of their children sat quietly but shined bright like a diamond in the audience.",
      "Rihanna showed up at his Los Angeles trial \u2014 where he\u2019s charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 for the first time on Wednesday, sitting between his sister and mother as his former friend testified about the moment he alleges Rocky fired at him.",
      "The singing superstar was escorted in and out of the courtroom surreptitiously, and was already sitting in Rocky\u2019s section before the jurors and the media entered. It\u2019s not clear if the jurors noticed she was there, but all other eyes in the room shifted to her.",
      "Wearing a long black dress with buttons that resembled an overcoat, she watched the proceedings calmly and periodically moved oversized, tortoiseshell glasses from atop her head to her eyes.",
      "The witness, who goes by A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron, described the night in November of 2021 when he and Rocky, their relationship straining, had a confrontation and scuffled on a Hollywood street, and Rocky pointed a gun at him before walking away.",
      "He testified Wednesday that he was shouting at Rocky as he walked after him, then Rocky pulled the gun again and held it in the air.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\u201d",

      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer, who will get to cross-examine Relli on Thursday, says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified under prosecution questioning, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",
      "He said \u201cI felt my hand hot\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",
      "When Rocky walked away, he testified that he followed and shouted after him, until the shots were fired.",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "The court day ended after just a few hours of testimony because of scheduling issues. Rihanna was shuffled out through a restricted exit by deputies, and Rocky left separately through the main courthouse doors.",
      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",
      "He\u2019s set to have his biggest career year as a multimedia star. This Sunday, he\u2019s nominated for a Grammy Award for best music video for his song \u201cTailor Swif,\u201d at the ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles (3 kilometers) from the Los Angeles courthouse where his trial\u2019s being held.",
      "He\u2019s also set to headline the Rolling Loud Music Festival, to star opposite Denzel Washington in a film directed by Spike Lee, and to co-chair the Met Gala in May.",

      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "A New York doctor has been indicted by a Lousiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",

      "",
      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",
      "",
      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",
      "",
      "\"I'm just disgusted,\" said long COVID patient Hayes. \"You wouldn't tell somebody with diabetes to breathe through it.\"",
      "",
      "Chim\u00e9re L. Sweeney, director and founder of the Black Long COVID Experience, said she's even taken breaks from seeking treatment after getting fed up with being told that her symptoms were due to her diet or mental health.",
      "",
      "\"You're at the whim of somebody who may not even understand the spectrum of long COVID,\" Sweeney said.",
      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",
      "",
      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",
      "",
      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",
      "",
      "Hayes said she would definitely volunteer for an investigational drug trial. For now, though, \"in order to not be absolutely miserable,\" she said she focuses on what she can do, like having dinner with her family. At the same time, Hayes doesn't want to spend the rest of her life on a beige couch.",
      "",

      "TOKYO -- Japan on Sunday launched a navigation satellite on its new flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a more precise location positioning system of its own.",
      "The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite successfully lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island. Everything so far has been as planned, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, said.",
      "Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network.",

      "Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 in order to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network.",
      "Sunday's launch, delayed by one day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",
      "Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series \u2014 the larger H3 and a much smaller Epsilon system. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market."

      "Dozens of farmers parked their tractors by the Most Slobode, or Freedom Bridge, saying they want to guard the students from incidents and potential attacks by sympathizers of Serbia's powerful President Aleksandar Vucic. Novi Sad residents brought them tea and coffee, pancakes, pastry and cooked food.",
      "University students in Serbia are leading a massive anti-corruption movement that was triggered by the Nov. 1. collapse of a concrete canopy at the central train station in Novi Sad, killing 15 people.",
      "Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the train station, poor oversight and disrespect of safety regulations. The issue has come to symbolize a wider discontent over the rule of law in Serbia.",
      "\"Well, the only way to end this (protest) is that our all demands are met,\" said student Lucija Maslakovic. The students have demanded a thorough investigation, publishing of all rail station renovation documents and punishment for those responsible for the canopy collapse.",
      "Daily protests throughout Serbia pose a major challenge for Vucic. The student-led movement already forced the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, Vucic's ally, and the government earlier this week.",
      "Tightly controlled pro-government media have mostly ignored the protests, occasionally carrying fake news and photos that show empty streets and claiming that the Novi Sad rally was a \u201cdisaster\u201d because of what they said was low turnout.",
      "The state broadcaster RTS made a surprise exception on Saturday and carried live coverage of the protest in Novi Sad that was attended by tens of thousands.",
      "The ruling Serbian Progressive Party was quick to react, strongly condemning the \u201cscandalous coverage\" of the bridge blockades in Novi Sad. According to Vucic's party, state TV has \u201cviolated all the rules and values \u200b\u200bof objective and impartial journalism with its scandalous reports.\"",
      "The students stayed at one of the Novi Sad bridges through the night after blocking all three city bridges on Saturday. Tens of thousands of people joined in, swarming the streets in further pressure on the governing populists.",
      "\u201cI support them fully, I can\u2019t believe how well they are organized, mature and good,\u201d said Jelena Djordjevic, a university professor from Novi Sad. \u201cThey are just incredible.\u201d",
      "The student protest has struck a chord in graft-plagued Serbia, where few citizens feel that state institutions, which are firmly under populist control, are working in public interest. Many believe that the collapse was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies.",
      "To pass the time on Saturday evening and overnight, the students played basketball and volleyball, listened to music, played chess or card games. In the morning, they could be seen clearing the garbage ahead of more protests.",
      "Hundreds had walked from Belgrade to Novi Sad for two days ahead of the blockades.",
      "At 11:52 p.m. on Saturday, the protesters held 15 minutes of silence for the 15 dead in the Nov. 1 canopy collapse. Two children were among the victims.",

      "The move is expected to trigger a motion of no confidence. Depending on whether political forces across the political board join forces, this could lead to Bayrou\u2019s downfall.",
      "That\u2019s what happened in December, when a confidence motion triggered by budget disputes forced Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign.",
      "Speaking to La Tribune Dimanche media, Bayrou said he will use a constitutional tool known as Article 49.3, which allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to confidence motions.",
      "On Monday, French lawmakers are set to debate the conclusions of a joint Parliamentary committee on the state budget and will turn their attention to the social security budget later in the week.",
      "\u201cNow we have to go straight to adoption,\u201d Bayrou said. \u201cA country like ours cannot be without a budget. The only way to do that is to make the government responsible.\u201d",
      "The looming showdown unfolds against the backdrop of a fractured National Assembly, left in disarray after June\u2019s snap elections delivered no clear majority.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron turned to Barnier in September in a bid to navigate the impasse. But Barnier\u2019s proposed austerity budget \u2014 slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros \u2014 only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering a dramatic political confrontation.",
      "To seek more stability for his minority government, Bayrou announced in January that he was open to renegotiate a contested plan raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. The government's revised plans for the budget that aim at limiting France's deficit to 5.4% of gross domestic product this year have also addressed concerns from opposition lawmakers.",
      "The joint committee has maintained an extra tax on large companies while increasing a tax on financial transactions. Also, Bayrou kept his commitment not to cut 4,000 jobs in national education, a move that had previously been envisaged.",
      "The far-left party France Unbowed has already announced it will put forward a motion of no confidence that is expected to get the support of Communist and Green lawmakers. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen was instrumental in ousting the previous government \u2014 her National Rally party has the largest single group in France\u2019s lower house of parliament \u2014 but her party has not given any voting instructions yet.",
      "The vote of the Socialists, who have adopted a constructive approach in recent weeks in negotiating the budget, could be decisive for Bayrou's future. They have said they remain opposed to the government but have pledged to work in the country's interest on budget issues.",
      "\u201cWe have obtained a number of reversals from the government and note that the commitments made by the prime minister ... have been honored,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cHowever, they remain largely inadequate.\u201d"

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan officials are preparing to deploy a trial vaccine as part of efforts to stem an outbreak of Ebola in the capital, Kampala, a top health official said Sunday.",
      "A range of scientists are developing research protocols relating to the planned deployment of more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola, said Pontiano Kaleebu, executive director of Uganda Virus Research Institute.",
      "\u201cProtocol is being accelerated\u201d to get all the necessary regulatory approvals, he said. \u201cThis vaccine is not yet licensed.\u201d",

The man died on Wednesday and authorities declared an outbreak the next day. Officials are still investigating the source of the outbreak, and there has been no other confirmed case.",
      "Uganda has had access to candidate vaccine doses since the end of an Ebola outbreak in September 2022 that killed at least 55 people. Ugandan officials ran out of time to begin a vaccine study when that outbreak, in central Uganda, was declared over about four months later, Kaleebu said.",
      "A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there.",

      "At least 44 contacts of the victim in the current outbreak have been identified, including 30 health workers and patients, according to Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Health.",
      "Confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease earlier this month, while in December Rwanda announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over. The ongoing Marburg outbreak in northern Tanzania\u2019s Kagera region has killed at least two people, according to local health authorities.",
      "Kampala\u2019s outbreak could prove difficult to respond to, because the city has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside Kampala and later traveled to Mbale, in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said the man also sought the services of a traditional healer.",
      "Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will discuss \"victory over Hamas,\u201d countering Iran and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries in his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Tuesday's meeting at the White House will be Trump's first with a foreign leader since returning to office. It comes as U.S. and Arab mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of an agreement to wind down the war in the Gaza Strip and release dozens of militant-held hostages.",
      "Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, has said it will not release the hostages slated to go free in the second phase without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "Netanyahu, who is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase ends in early March, has said Israel is still committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "It's unclear where Trump stands in all this.",
      "He has been a staunch supporter of Israel, but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. The deal has halted the fighting and led to the release of 18 hostages who had been held for over 15 months, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "In a statement released ahead of his departure on Sunday, Netanyahu said they would discuss \u201cvictory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,\u201d referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas.",
      "He said that by working together, they could \"strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.\u201d",
      "The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters. The war has left large parts of several cities in ruins and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people.",
      "Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is to release a total of 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase, in which the war would end and the remaining 60 or so hostages would be returned, are set to begin Monday. If the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March.",
      "Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations in their final weeks last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and the two were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase in Washington on Monday.",
      "Trump, who brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term, is believed to be seeking a wider and potentially historic agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.",
      "But the kingdom, which resisted similar entreaties from the Biden administration, has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Netanyahu's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and a key partner, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave the governing coalition if the war is not resumed next month. That would raise the likelihood of early elections in which Netanyahu could be voted out.",
      "Even as the Gaza ceasefire has held for two weeks, Israel has ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin to the town of Tamun.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry said a 73-year-old man was shot dead by Israeli troops in Jenin early Sunday. There was no immediate comment from the military.",
      "The ministry had earlier reported five killed, including a 16-year-old, in Israeli airstrikes overnight.",
      "The military said it killed two militants \u2014 one of whom had been freed as part of the weeklong Gaza ceasefire in November 2023 \u2014 in an airstrike on a village near Jenin. It said the two were planning an imminent attack, and that additional strikes targeted two other militant cells.",

      "Al-Sharaa and HTS have carefully managed their public image in the time since, with the interim president favoring an olive-colored military look similar to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointing women to roles and trying to maintain ties to Syria's Christian and Shiite Alawite populations.",
      "That also includes keeping both Iran and Russia largely at arms' length as well. Iran has yet to reopen its embassy in Damascus, which had been a key node in running operations through its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d including Assad's Syria, Lebanon's Hezbollah militia and other partners. Russia meanwhile would like to maintain access to air and sea bases it has in Syria, but took in Assad when he fled Syria during the advance.",
      "Those moves appear aimed at reassuring the West and trying to get crippling sanctions lifted on Syria. Rebuilding the country after over a decade of war will likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention covering the needs of Syria's people, millions of whom remain impoverished.",
      "Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus in January and said Riyadh has been \u201cactively engaging in dialogue\u201d to lift sanctions on Syria. Saudi Arabia, unlike Al-Sharaa\u2019s key allies in Turkey and Qatar, restored ties with Assad in 2023 alongside most of the Arab world. Getting sanctions lifted could go a long way in cementing their relationship.",
      "Meanwhile, Syria's interim government still faces challenges from the Islamic State group and other militants in the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in Manbij, a city in Syria's Aleppo governorate, killing four civilians and wounding nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials.",
      "Turkish-backed Syrian rebels had seized Manbij in December, part of a push by Ankara to secure Syrian territory close to its border for a buffer zone.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The Associated Press interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday at a crucial juncture of the nearly three-year war against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to end the war within six months of his inauguration, but both sides are far apart, and it is unclear how a ceasefire deal could take shape.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops continue to lose territory in eastern Ukraine, and the country faces near-daily Russian attacks targeting homes and infrastructure. That raises fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin prefers to wait out the war because he believes he will triumph.",
      "Here are some takeaways from AP\u2019s interview with Zelenskyy:",
      "Zelenskyy said talks between the U.S. and Russia about the war in his country that exclude Ukraine would be \u201cdangerous,\u201d and he seeks more communication between the Trump administration and Kyiv.",
      "His remarks followed comments Friday by Trump, who said American and Russian officials were \u201calready talking\u201d about ending the war. Trump said his administration has had \u201cvery serious\u201d discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate.",
      "Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a \u201cgeneral level,\u201d and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.",
      "A planned visit by Trump\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said it will be rescheduled. He also said he and Trump discussed meeting to develop a plan for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy hoped that would led to conversations with Russian officials.",
      "A key question underlying any ceasefire proposal will be Russia\u2019s willingness to engage in talks, especially now that its forces appear to have the upper hand on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.",
      "He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.",
      "Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the \u201ccheapest\u201d option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.",
      "Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine\u2019s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. and European allies to maintain over time, Zelenskyy said. He also said Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be a bonus for the alliance, especially if Trump seeks to bring back home overseas U.S. troops.",
      "Approving Ukraine\u2019s NATO bid would be \u201ca great victory\u201d for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president\u2019s penchant for winners and business deals.",
      "Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.",
      "Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.",
      "He added: \u201cImagine, there is a contingent. The question is who is in charge? Who is the main one? What will they do if there are Russian strikes? Missiles, disembarkation, attack from the sea, crossing of the land borderline, offensive. What will they do? What are their mandates?\u201d"

      "DORTMUND, Germany -- German hunters tried to convince the jury at a national stag calling championship that they can imitate a bellowing red deer most realistically.",
      "The unique tradition goes back hundreds of years and was initially aimed at feigning a stag's rival during the rutting season so the deer comes out. The trick gave hunters a chance to better assess the stag before deciding whether to shoot it.",
      "The competition took place Friday at the Jagd & Hund, or hunting and dog, trade fair in the western city of Dortmund. There were no animals, only bellowing men wearing traditional hunters' garb including green hats with a tuft of chamois hair.",
      "The hunters used specially made ox horns, triton snail shells, glass cylinders, the hollow stems of the giant hogweed, and a number of artificially produced instruments to amplify the sound and resonance.",
      "A stag\u2019s vocalizations are not only very diverse, but also vary according to age, state of mind and duration of the rut, during which they become increasingly hoarse, as well as the mood of the herd, according to the organizers.",
      "In Dortmund, the hunters were asked to compete in three disciplines: the call of the old, searching stag, the call of the dominant male in a pack of does, and the calling duel between two equally strong stags at the height of the rut. The members of the jury listened with closed eyes to make sure nothing would distract them from the sound.",
      "\u201cThe stag calling for me, it\u2019s the fascinating thing to play with the stags,\" said Fabian Wenzel, who won the championship. \u201cAnd maybe shoot an old stag after calling him \u2014 that's the biggest thing for every hunter.\u201d",
      "Wenzel, a hunter from the small village of N\u00fcdlingen in Bavaria, won the title for the fifth time in a row and will participate in the European Stag Calling Championships, which will take place in Lithuania in October.",

      "RAMALLAH, West Bank -- Israel on Saturday released a total of 183 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for three Israeli hostages held in Gaza as the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas continued to gain traction after nearly two weeks.",
      "In a sign of progress, Saturday\u2019s release included for the first time some of the 1,000 detainees from Gaza that Israel has agreed to free during Phase 1 of the deal on condition that they did not participate in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Israel-Hamas war.",

      "Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. One independent audit found that el-Halabi had enforced internal controls and ordered employees to avoid anyone suspected of Hamas ties.",
      "World Vision has also said that the accusations that el-Halabi transferred 60% of the charity\u2019s annual budget for Gaza to Hamas could not be reconciled with its financial records.",
      "Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them, with all procedures shielded from the public and shrouded in unusual secrecy. U.N. experts say el-Halabi was questioned for 50 days without access to a lawyer. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "Israel has attributed the closed hearings to sensitive security information being relayed. Israeli courts typically hold closed hearings to protect the sources of their information.",
      "His prolonged detention sent a chill through nongovernmental groups providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza. After el-Halabi\u2019s arrest, World Vision suspended its activities in Gaza, where it it says its aid had benefited nearly 40,000 children affected by the crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade on the enclave.",
      "Amouri, 44, from the northern West Bank city of Jenin, was arrested for his alleged role in manufacturing the powerful car bomb that detonated beside an Israeli bus packed with passengers on June 5, 2002, killing 17 Israelis in what became known as the Megiddo Junction suicide bombing.",
      "The attack during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, between 2000 and 2005, took place in northern Israel. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.",
      "Amouri was sentenced to life in prison, plus 20 years. He was among those transferred to Egypt Saturday and released into exile.",

      "Abu Srour, 50, sentenced to life in prison over a 2000 attack that killed Israeli soldier Shahar Veckart, was also among those released Saturday into exile.",
      "Hailing from Aida refugee camp in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Abu Srour was detained in 2001 and convicted the next year over the shooting at Rachel\u2019s Tomb, the traditional burial place of the wife of the biblical patriarch Jacob. During the second intifada, the shrine became a target of Palestinian militants protesting Israel\u2019s claim to the holy site revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike.",

      "Zubeidi once led the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade. After the second intifada in 2006, he co-founded a theater in his hometown of Jenin refugee camp, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, to promote what he described as cultural resistance to Israel. Even today, the Freedom Theater puts on everything from Shakespeare to stand-up comedy to plays written by residents.",
      "In 2019, after Zubeidi had already served years in prison for attacks in the early 2000s, Israel arrested him again over his alleged involvement in shooting attacks that targeted buses of Israeli settlers but caused no injuries.",
      "Zubeidi, who was released Thursday into the West Bank, had been awaiting trial in prison. He denies the charges, saying that he gave up militancy to focus on his political activism after the intifada.",
      "In 2021, he and five other prisoners tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel, an escape that helped solidify Zubeidi\u2019s image among Palestinians as a folk hero. All six were recaptured days later.",
      "A Hamas militant during the second intifada, Abu Warda helped organize a series of suicide bombings that killed over 40 people and wounded more than a hundred others. Israel arrested him in 2002, and sentenced him to 48 terms of lifetime imprisonment, among the longest sentences it ever issued.",
      "As a young student, Abu Warda joined Hamas at the start of the intifada following Israel\u2019s killing of Yahya Ayyash, the militant group\u2019s leading bomb maker, in 1996.",
      "Palestinian authorities said at the time that Warda had helped to recruit suicide bombers \u2014 including his cousin, his cousin\u2019s neighbor and a classmate at the Ramallah Teachers College \u2014 whose attacks targeting crowded civilian areas in Israeli cities killed scores of people in the early 2000s.",
      "Warda was released and deported on Thursday.",
      "An activist in Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Aradeh was sentenced to life in prison for a range of offenses going back to the second intifada. Some of the charges, according to the Israeli Prison Service, included planting an explosive device and attempting murder.",
      "He was credited with plotting the extraordinary prison escape in 2021, when he and five other detainees, including Zubeidi, used spoons to tunnel out one of Israel\u2019s most secure prisons. They remained at large for days before being caught.",
      "From an impoverished and politically active family in Jenin, in the northern occupied West Bank, Aradeh has three brothers and a sister who have all spent years in Israeli prisons.",
      "He was welcomed as a sort of cult hero in Ramallah on Jan. 25 as family, friends and fans swarmed him, some chanting \u201cThe freedom tunnel!\u201d in reference to his jailbreak.",
      "All three men hail from the neighborhood of Silwan, in east Jerusalem, and rose within the ranks of Hamas. Held responsible for a string of deadly attacks during the second intifada, the men were sentenced to multiple life sentences in 2002.",
      "They were accused of plotting a suicide bombing at a crowded pool hall near Tel Aviv in 2002 that killed 15 people. Later that year, they were found to have orchestrated a bombing at Hebrew University that killed nine people, including five American students. Israel had described Odeh, who was working as a painter at the university at the time, as the kingpin in the attack.",
      "All three were transferred to Egypt on Jan. 25. Their families live in Jerusalem and said they will join them in exile.",
      "Three brothers from the prominent Abu Hamid family of the Al-Amari refugee camp in Ramallah \u2014 Nasser, 51, Mohammad, 44, and Sharif, 48 \u2014 were also deported to Egypt on Jan. 25. They had been sentenced to life in prison over deadly militant attacks against Israelis in 2002.",
      "Their brother, a different Nasser Abu Hamid, was one of the founders of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade. He was also sentenced to life in prison for several deadly attacks. His 2022 death from lung cancer behind bars unleashed a wave of angry protests across the West Bank as Palestinian officials accused Israel of medical neglect.",
      "The family has a long arc of Palestinian militancy. The mother, Latifa Abu Hamid, 72, now has three sons exiled, one still imprisoned, one who died in prison and one who was killed by Israeli forces. Their family house has been demolished at least three times by Israel, which defends such punitive home demolitions as a deterrent against future attacks.",
      "Al-Tous had held the title of longest continuous Israeli imprisonment until his release last Saturday, Palestinian authorities said.",
      "First arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces along the Jordanian border, the activist in the Fatah party spent a total of 39 years behind bars. Originally from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, he was among the prisoners exiled on Jan. 25."

      "The court referred the case to the European Court of Justice, in Luxembourg, which is expected to issue a ruling on Feb. 25 related to the previous cases, in which the series of lower court rulings have opened a fissure between the Meloni government and the Italian judicial system.",
      "In October and November, judges similarly refused to approve the expulsion of much smaller groups of migrants, seeking clarity from the European court on which countries were safe for repatriation of people whose asylum claims are rejected.",
      "Italy last year signed a five-year agreement to process up to 3,000 migrants a month beyond EU borders as part of Meloni\u2019s program to combat illegal migration to Italy, which is the first landfall for tens of thousands of migrants who make the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean Sea.",

      "Balochistan has for years been the scene of a long-running insurgency, with several separatist groups staging attacks, targeting mainly security forces in their quest for independence. The province also has an array of militant groups that are active there."

    "story": [
      "Fay Vincent, who became baseball commissioner in 1989 and then was forced out three years later by owners intent on a labor confrontation with players, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Fay Vincent, who became an unexpected baseball commissioner in 1989 following the death of A. Bartlett Giamatti and then was forced out three years later by owners intent on a labor confrontation with players, has died. He was 86.",
      "Vincent had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for bladder cancer and developed complications that included bleeding, said his wife, Christina. He asked that treatment be stopped and died Saturday at a hospital in Vero Beach, Florida.",
      "\u201cMr. Vincent served the game during a time of many challenges, and he remained proud of his association with our national pastime throughout his life,\u201d current commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.",
      "A lawyer who became a movie studio executive at the behest of a college friend, Vincent had been retired for three decades and lived in New Canaan, Connecticut, and Vero Beach.",
      "During his three-year tenure as commissioner, Vincent had a string of what he called \u201cthree-cigar days,\u201d angering owners by becoming the first management official to admit the collusion among teams against free agents following the 1985, \u201886 and \u201987 seasons. He suspended the Yankees\u2019 George Steinbrenner, divided expansion fees among both leagues, attempted to force National League realignment and negotiated a settlement that ended a 1990 spring training lockout.",
      "\u201cI had the conviction that being commissioner was a public trust. I tried to do what I thought was best for the game and the public who cared so much about it,\u201d Vincent said in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI had mixed results. Sometimes I\u2019m pleased with what I did. The tragedy of baseball is the single biggest thing I left undone was to build a decent relationship between the owners and the players. I thought somebody would take over after me and get that done. If I died tomorrow, that would be the big regret, is that the players and the owners still have to make some commitment to each other to be partners and to build the game.\u201d",
      "Born May 29, 1938, Vincent was a securities lawyer when he was hired in 1978 as president and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. by Herbert Allen Jr., who had known him their time as undergraduates at Williams College.",
      "Vincent remained a corporate executive for a decade, then had been with a law firm for only a few months when he was asked to become deputy commissioner by Giamatti, a friend since they met during a party at Princeton in the 1970s.",
      "Giamatti, the former Yale president, was NL president from June 1986 until succeeding Peter Ueberroth as commissioner in April 1989. Giamatti tasked Vincent with supervising the gambling investigation of career hits leader Pete Rose, and Vincent hired lawyer John M. Dowd to lead a probe that led to Rose agreeing to a lifetime ban that August.",
      "Giamatti died of a heart attack that Sept. 1, and Vincent was elected commissioner by owners 12 days later and given a 4 1/2-year term.",
      "Vincent\u2019s first World Series in charge was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which struck a half-hour before Game 3 was to start at San Francisco\u2019s Candlestick Park. Vincent was praised for a 10-day delay before the series resumed.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming very clear to us in Major League Baseball that our concerns, our issue, is a rather modest one,\u201d he said then.",
      "His first full season as commissioner began after a 32-day spring training lockout. The deal he reached angered owners seeking greater management gains, a group led by Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox.",
      "In July 1990, Vincent signed an agreement with George Steinbrenner under which the New York Yankees principal owner resigned as managing general partner because of his dealings with a $40,000 payment to a gambler, Howard Spira, to find embarrassing information about outfielder Dave Winfield. Vincent later reinstated Steinbrenner as of 1993.",
      "The following June, Vincent ruled the American League was to receive $42 million of the $190 million in expansion fees due for the National League adding Colorado and Miami in 1993. He also ordered both leagues to supply players equally for the expansion draft and that any future expansion money be divided equally among all clubs.",
      "In July 1992 he ordered NL realignment for the following year, moving the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals to the West Division in 1993, and the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds to the East. The Cubs obtained an injunction in federal court, and the plan was dropped after Vincent\u2019s departure.",
      "By mid-August, Selig and Reinsdorf gained enough support to cause AL president Bobby Brown and NL head Bill White to call a special meeting aimed at ousting Vincent. Owners approved a resolution of no confidence in an 18-9 vote on Sept. 3. After a weekend of thought at his home on Cape Cod, Vincent quit four days later, on Labor Day.",
      "\u201cThe commissioner has to look out for the fans, and the owners don\u2019t want to hear me speak that idea,\" Vincent said.",
      "Selig was installed as chairman of the executive council, a new position that made him in effect acting commissioner. He led owners through a 7 1/2-month strike in 1994-95, was voted commissioner in 1998 and remained on the job until retiring in 2015.",
      "A longtime Anglophile, Vincent wanted to decompress and rented the Mill House in the Berkshire village of Sutton Courtenay for the first six months of 1993. Living in the home of former British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, Vincent frequently entertained visitors during his sabbatical.",
      "Francis Thomas Vincent Jr. was born May 29, 1938, at Waterbury, Connecticut. His father, Francis, was a football and baseball star at Yale in the 1930s and became a college football official. His mother, the former Alice Lynch, was a housewife.",
      "Vincent was a tackle and center at Williams until he broke his back during his freshman year, falling four floors from an icy ledge outside his dormitory after his roommates locked him out as a prank. His left leg was partially paralyzed and he walked with a cane. Vincent, a Roman Catholic, gave up thoughts of Jesuit training because of the injury. Still, he managed to finish school on time and graduate Phi Beta Kappa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky in a lot of ways \u2014 mostly I survived that terrible accident and being paralyzed for so long,\u201d Vincent said in 2023. \u201cI can\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d",
      "He went to Yale Law School, started as an associate at Whitman & Ransom in New York in 1963 and stayed there for five years.",
      "In 1968, he moved to Caplin & Drysdale Chartered in Washington and practiced securities law there for almost 10 years, becoming a partner. In March 1978 he quit the firm to become associate director of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Division of Corporate Finance. His stay there was rather brief.",
      "Allen, who was two years behind Vincent at Williams, decided that summer to fire Alan J. Hirschfield, Columbia Pictures Industries\u2019 CEO. For more than a year, the company had been in turmoil after David Begelman, president of the movie studio, was discovered to have forged checks.",
      "Vincent replaced Hirschfield on July 13 and ran the company so well that Allen & Co. sold it to Coca-Cola Co. in 1982 for $692 million. Vincent was promoted from president to chairman and was named executive vice president of Coca-Cola\u2019s new Entertainment Business Sector.",
      "He went to Hollywood only about six times a year and let his production heads \u2014Frank Price, Guy McIlwaine and David Puttnam \u2014 make the artistic decisions. While Vincent ran the company, Columbia released \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cThe Big Chill,\u201d \u201cGandhi\u201d and \u201cTootsie.\u201d",
      "Still, he remained devoted to baseball.",
      "\u201cHe talked about baseball every day,\u201d Allen said. \u201cA couple of times I went with him to Mets\u2019 opening day.\u201d",
      "On Sept. 1, 1987, Coca-Cola bought Tri-Star Pictures and Tri-Star\u2019s Victor A. Kaufman replaced Vincent, who was reassigned to oversee equity investments in Coca-Cola Bottling\u2019s properties. Vincent quit in 1988 and went to Caplin & Drysdale\u2019s New York office as a partner. Before he settled in, Giamatti asked him to join baseball.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d always been a baseball fan,\u201d Vincent said then. \u201cI\u2019ve followed baseball as long as I can remember.\u201d",
      "In one of his lasting acts as commissioner, he chaired an eight-member committee for statistical accuracy, which removed the asterisk that had been next to Roger Maris\u2019 entry as the season home run leader and deleted 50 no-hitters. The group defined a no-hitter as games of nine innings or more that ended with no hits.",
      "He recorded interviews with Hall of Fame members and Negro Leagues players for an oral history project that led to three books: \u201cThe Only Game in Town\u201d (2006), \u201cWe Would Have Played for Nothing\u201d (2009) and \u201cIt\u2019s What\u2019s Inside the Lines That Counts\u201d (2010). In 2024, he made a $2 million gift to Yale to endow the Yale baseball coach\u2019s position in the name of his father.",
      "Vincent married the former Valerie McMahon in 1965 and they had a daughter Anne and twin sons William, and Edward. They divorced in 1994 and he married Christina Watkins in 1998.",

      "It was a big opening for the Universal Pictures release adapted from the popular graphic novel series by author Dav Pilkey.

      "Federal authorities have arrested a former Federal Reserve senior adviser for allegedly giving inside economic information to China",
      "Federal authorities have arrested a former Federal Reserve senior adviser for allegedly giving inside economic information to China.",
      "A grand jury indictment accuses John Harold Rogers, 63, of Vienna, Virginia, of stealing Federal Reserve trade secrets and selling them to Chinese intelligence officials for at least $450,000 by posing as a university professor in China. He is also accused of lying to Federal Reserve investigators and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officials.",
      "The Department of Justice announced Rogers' indictment and arrest on Friday, the same day he made his first appearance before a Washington court. Rogers is being held without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, according to court records.",
      "\u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Rogers betrayed his country while employed at the Federal Reserve by providing restricted U.S. financial and economic information to Chinese government intelligence officers,\u201d said Assistant Director Kevin Vorndran of the FBI Counterintelligence Division in an announcement of Rogers' indictment and arrest.",
      "\u201cThis information could allow adversaries to illegally gain a strategic economic advantage at the expense of the U.S. This indictment sends a clear message that the FBI and our partners will hold accountable those who threaten our national security,\u201d Vorndran said.",
      "A public defender listed in court records as being assigned to Rogers' case did not immediately respond Saturday to a request for comment.",
      "The Justice Department said the information \u201ccould allow China to manipulate the U.S. market ... in a manner to insider trading.\u201d The department noted that China, as of October 2024, held about $816 billion in U.S. foreign debt and that Chinese financial players could benefit from inside knowledge of U.S. economic policy, such as advance notice of federal funds rate changes, when making decisions about buying and selling U.S. debt instruments.",
      "Rogers, a U.S. citizen with a doctorate in economics, worked for the Federal Reserve from 2010 until 2021, according to the indictment.",
      "According to the indictment, Rogers, a U.S. citizen with a Ph.D. in economics, worked as a Senior Adviser in FRB\u2019s Division of International Finance of the FRB from 2010 until 2021, where he would have had access to a range of classified information.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Rogers and two Chinese co-conspirators began communicating as early as 2013. The indictment asserts that Rogers later forwarded protected information to his personal email or made print copies to pass along to his co-conspirators. The cache allegedly included proprietary economic data and analysis, briefing books written for Federal Reserve governors, details of Federal Open Market Committee deliberations and future announcements, and accounts of conversations about tariffs targeted at China, according to the indictment.",
      "Rogers is accused of meeting co-conspirators in China for multiple visits, under the guise of him being an academic instructor teaching them as students. The indictment alleges that in 2023, Rogers received $450,000 as a part-time professor at a Chinese university. ___"

    "story": [
      "With home prices high, American families are grappling with the prospect that homeownership might remain out of reach for them for a long time",
      "The Petersen family\u2019s two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small.",
      "Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, says her mother, Jenn Petersen.",
      "The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area.",
      "According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing \u2014 including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment \u2014 to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent.",
      "Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens \u2014 they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house,\u201d Petersen said.",
      "The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash.",
      "\u201cThe American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThe whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I\u2019ve done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn\u2019t fit financially.\u201d",
      "The same is true for an increasing number of American families.",
      "In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018.",
      "The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option.",
      "\u201cWage growth hasn\u2019t kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates,\u201d said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Atlanta Fed. \u201cEven though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.\u201d",
      "That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the U.S. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.",
      "Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that \u201cthere are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they\u2019d rather own a home than rent.\u201d",
      "McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too \u2014 it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in.",
      "McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease \u2014 all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the \u201capex of the American dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?\u201d",
      "It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family \u201chouse poor.\u201d",
      "\"I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach,\" she said. \u201cAt some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?\u201d",
      "Petersen said she'll \u201calways hold out a little bit of hope\" that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget?",
      "\u201cI'd take that,\u201d she said.",
      "Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.",
      "\u201cThe prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher,\u201d said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations.",
      "Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place.",
      "Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing \u2014 funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage.",
      "Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself \u2014 Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.",
      "But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working so hard \u2014 jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics.",
      "\u201cI was determined to have my piece of the pie,\" she said. \u201cI felt I deserved that. I\u2019ve always worked. Always. Nonstop.\"",

      "Trump sued CBS for $10 billion over the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good. Published reports said CBS' parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump's lawyers about a settlement.",
      "The network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump's appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process.",
      "The case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump's lawsuit \u201ccompletely without merit\u201d and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.",
      "The Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Oct. 6 and the next night on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d The network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker's question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.",
      "In his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted \u201cpartisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.\u201d",
      "Trump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers.",
      "Trump had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he has also pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and raise revenues for the federal government.",
      "\u201cStarting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. \u201cThese are promises made and promises kept by the president.\u201d",
      "The tariffs carry both political and economic risks for Trump, who is just two weeks into his second term. Many voters backed the Republican on the promise that he could tamp down inflation, but the possibility of tariffs could trigger higher prices and potentially disrupt the energy, auto, lumber and agricultural sectors.",
      "Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts.",
      "The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\u201d",
      "Trudeau said tariffs would have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d for the U.S, putting American jobs at risk and causing prices to rise. Trudeau reiterated that less than 1% of the fentanyl and illegal crossings into the U.S. come from Canada.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has maintained a dialogue with Trump\u2019s team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \u201cPlan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",

      "\u201cFor Mexico,\u2019\u2019 the study said, \u201ca 25% tariff would be catastrophic.

      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey",
      "In the first serious fallout from President Donald Trump's early actions against offshore wind power, oil and gas giant Shell is walking away from a major project off the coast of New Jersey.",
      "Shell told The Associated Press it is writing off the project, citing increased competition, delays and a changing market.",
      "\u201cNaturally we also take regulatory context into consideration,\u201d spokesperson Natalie Gunnell said in an email.",
      "Shell co-owns the large Atlantic Shores project, which has most of its permits and would generate enough power for 1 million homes if both of two phases were completed. That\u2019s enough for one-third of New Jersey households.",
      "It's unclear whether Shell's decision kills the project \u2014 partner EDF-RE Offshore Development says it remains committed to Atlantic Shores.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order singling out offshore wind for contempt with a temporary halt on all lease sales in federal waters and a pause on approvals, permits and loans. Perhaps most of interest to Shell, the order directs administration officials to review existing offshore wind energy leases and identify any legal reasons to terminate them.",
      "Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three decades in Europe, and more recently in Asia. They are considered by experts to be an essential part of addressing climate change because they can take the place of fossil fuel plants, if paired with battery storage. New Jersey has set a goal of generating 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2035.",
      "The Biden administration approved plans to build the Atlantic Shores project in two phases in October, but construction has not begun. Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF, said the partners are facing significant uncertainty about their lease, and other developers are watching what happens with Atlantic Shores closely. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncertain territory here,\u201d he added.",
      "Offshore wind foes, who are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey, celebrated Shell\u2019s withdrawal. Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey, helped the Trump team draft the executive order. He said Shell\u2019s decision is a \u201cbig win\u201d for New Jersey\u2019s coastline and economy but \u201cthis fight is not over.\u201d",
      "Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, said that without Shell's financial backing, it appears the project is \u201cdead in the water.\u201d",
      "Shell is writing off a nearly $1 billion investment. It announced its decision on Thursday, as it reported a 16% decline in full-year earnings of $23.7 billion from $28.3 billion. Most of its business is oil and gas.",
      "Danish wind developer Orsted was close to beginning work on two offshore wind farms in New Jersey but scrapped the project in Oct. 2023 after deciding it would not be economical.",
      "A lot of clean energy is cheap now, but offshore wind is still among the most expensive. That can make these projects less attractive to investors, absent strong policy support, said Coco Zhang, vice president for environmental, social and governance research at ING.",
      "\u201cThe potential uncertainty that the executive order has brought to the market, it cannot be ignored,\u201d she said.",
      "The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution, setting national goals to deploy offshore wind energy, holding lease sales and approving nearly a dozen commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects.",

      "An inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose slightly last month, the latest sign that some consumer prices remain stubbornly elevated, even as inflation is cooling in fits and starts",
      "WASHINGTON -- An inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose slightly last month, while some underlying prices pressures showed signs of easing.",
      "The latest inflation figures arrive as President Donald Trump has threatened to impose big import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico, potentially affecting everything from autos to avocados, which could push prices higher in the coming months.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose 2.6% in December from a year earlier, up from a 2.4% annual pace in November and the third straight increase. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices increased 2.8% compared with a year ago, the same as in November and October.",
      "There were some positive signs in Wednesday\u2019s report, however. When measured in shorter time frames, inflation is slowing: In December, core prices ticked up 0.2% from the previous month, a pace that is nearly consistent with the Fed\u2019s annual target. Economists \u2014 and Fed officials \u2014 pay close attention to core prices because they provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures arrive just two days after Federal Reserve officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, decided to pause their interest rate cuts in part because inflation has largely been stuck at about 2.5%, above their 2% target, for the past six months.",
      "In the past three months, core prices have risen at an annual rate of just 2.2%, down from 2.6% in November.",
      "Many businesses raise prices at the start of the year, which could push up inflation a bit when January's figures are released next month. But the Fed's preferred gauge should decline steadily in the next few months, economists say, as higher inflation readings early last year fall out of the year-over-year figures.",
      "\u201cBeyond that, however, the growing risk that Trump will impose tariffs a little earlier than we are assuming presents an upside risk to inflation,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm, said in a written note.",
      "Overall inflation climbed 0.3% in December from the previous month, driven higher by a jump in gas prices. Monthly increases at that level, if they continued, would exceed the Fed's target.",
      "The Commerce Department's report also showed consumer spending rose a healthy 0.7% in December from the previous month, fueled in part by steady wage gains and higher stock prices and home values. Incomes rose 0.4%, the government said. With spending outpacing incomes, the savings rate fell to 3.8% from 4.1%.",
      "Americans specifically ramped up spending on goods, such as electronics and furniture, likely a sign that consumers are buying more manufactured products, many of which are imported, before the potential imposition of tariffs that Trump has threatened to implement.",
      "Underlying trends point to lower inflation ahead. Apartment rental prices and other housing costs are slowly moderating. And a sluggish labor market has meant wage growth has slipped, which means companies are under less pressure to raise prices to offset higher labor costs.",
      "\u201cWe seem to be set up for further progress,\u201d Powell said Wednesday at a news conference, referring to inflation. \u201cBut being \u2018seem to set up for' it is one thing, having it is another. So we're going to want to see further progress on inflation.\u201d",
      "Until then, Powell suggested, the Fed is likely to keep its key rate at about 4.3%, down a full percentage point from a two-decade peak last year before three cuts at the end of 2024. The Fed expects higher borrowing costs will weigh on spending and bring inflation down further.",
      "Consumers, meanwhile, powered strong growth in the final three months of last year, when the economy expanded at a solid 2.3% annual rate. Growth was stronger in the July-September quarter, at 3.1%, but the fourth-quarter expansion was held back by a sharp reduction in business inventories, which should reverse in coming quarters."

      "The drugstore chain said Thursday after markets closed that it made the move to strengthen its balance sheet and improve free cash flow as company leaders try to turn around the struggling business.",
      "Walgreens has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. The company is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The company said in a brief statement Thursday that its cash needs over the next several years for things like litigation and debt refinancing were big parts of the decision to suspend the dividend.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing the drugstore chain of filling millions of prescriptions without a legitimate purpose, including some for dangerous amounts of opioids.",
      "In September, the company said it would pay $106 million to settle separate litigation over false payment claims.",
      "Walgreens started last year by cutting the quarterly dividend nearly in half. The company slashed the payout to 25 cents from 48 cents after spending about $1.7 billion on cash dividends in fiscal 2023.",
      "Chief Financial Officer Manmohan Mahajan told analysts earlier this month that Walgreens still was evaluating \u201cthe appropriateness and size of our dividend as part of our capital allocation policy.\u201d",

      "There were only two dividend suspensions last year in the S&P 500, including one from the chipmaker Intel. There generally are only a few each year.",
      "A dividend suspension \u201cis sending a signal to the whole world that I have a problem, and it\u2019s cash flow and it\u2019s not short term,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.",
      "But he added that markets frequently see a dividend suspension as a positive sign initially because the company recognizes it has a problem and is taking a step to correct it.",
      "The company says it has paid cash dividends every quarter since 1933, a streak stretching more than 90 years or nearly 370 straight quarters.",
      "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., based in Deerfield, Illinois, were down more than 11% to $10.16 in premarket trading."

      "WASHINGTON -- The 25% tax that President Donald Trump plans to slap on imports from Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday could drive up the price of everything from gasoline and pickup trucks, to Super Bowl party guacamole dip.",
      "The tariffs would also invite retaliation. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, has already vowed to counterpunch by pulling American alcohol off store shelves in the Canadian province \u2013 no idle threat; Canada is the world\u2019s No. 2 market for America\u2019s distilled spirits (behind the 27-nation European Union).",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten to blow up the trade agreement he himself negotiated with America\u2019s neighbors in his first term. His U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2013 \u201cthe fairest, most balanced, and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law,\u2019\u2019 Trump once declared -- was supposed to bring predictability to North American trade, giving businesses the confidence to make investments.",
      "But when it comes to the self-proclaimed \u201cTariff Man,\u2019\u2019 Trump and his passion for plastering taxes on foreign goods, nothing is predictable, and nothing is ever really settled.",
      "\u201cTariffs at those levels and at that scope would effectively destroy the agreement that Trump himself negotiated and always brags about,\u2019\u2019 said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.",
      "The president says the 25% levies are designed to pressure America\u2019s two neighbors to do more to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Michael Robinet of S&P Global Mobility and many other analysts suspect the tariff threat is also designed to get Canada and Mexico to go along with America\u2019s demands for changes to the USMCA when it comes up for renewal next year.",
      "Robinet, executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global, said he doubts that Trump will go ahead with 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports \u2013 what he calls a \u201cshock-to-the-system\u2019\u2019 approach that would freeze the North American economy in a \u201cTariff Winter.\u2019\u2019 Instead, Robinet said, Trump might postpone or phase in the tariffs or initially exempt some industries to show Canada and Mexico how much worse things could get if he doesn\u2019t get his way.",
      "Trump pressured Mexico and Canada into agreeing to the USMCA five years ago, partly to narrow the United States\u2019 big trade deficit \u2013 the gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys.",
      "It hasn\u2019t worked out that way.",
      "The U.S. deficit in the trade of goods of Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023 (the last full year for which numbers are available). That is partly because Mexico has replaced China, locked in an ongoing trade war with the United States, as the source of many U.S. imports \u2013 furniture, textiles, shoes, laptops, computer servers.",
      "The trade gap in goods with Canada has ballooned, too: From $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023. The deficit largely reflects America\u2019s imports of Canadian energy.",
      "\u201cThe USMCA has not met the goals that Trump set forth for it. Our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico is bigger than it was, considerably,\u2019\u2019 said Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime critic of America\u2019s free trade pacts. \u201cA lot of jobs have been offshored to Mexico since USMCA.\u2019\u2019",
      "When the USMCA comes up for renewal next year, the U.S. is expected to press for rules that would do more to encourage factories to produce in the United States. And it could seek a crackdown on Chinese goods being sent through Mexico to the United States to evade tariffs that Trump and President Joe Biden imposed on Beijing.",
      "The United States now does far more business \u2013 exports and imports alike \u2013 with both Canada and Mexico than it does with China. In 2023, U.S. trade of both goods and services with Canada and Mexico came to more than $1.8 trillion, compared with $643 billion with China. Because of USMCA \u2013 and the regional trade deal it replaced in 2020 \u2013 most products cross the region\u2019s borders tariff-free.",
      "The threatened 25% tariffs are causing heartburn in corporate boardrooms. If Trump goes ahead with his threat, tariffs would surge from $1.3 billion to $132 billion a year on Mexico\u2019s imports to the United States and from $440 million to $107 billion on Canada\u2019s, according to the tax and consulting firm PwC.",
      "And no one knows if Trump will really pull the trigger or how long the tariffs would stay in place if he does. \u201cIt\u2019s really thrown industry into this turmoil of anxiety,\u201d said trade lawyer Chandri Navarro, senior counsel at Baker & McKenzie. \u201cWhat industry likes is certainty. You\u2019re making production decisions, supply chain decisions, purchasing decisions five years out.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump views tariffs as a fix-it for most of what ails the economy. He says they raise money for cuts in income and corporate taxes, encourage companies to move production to the United States and offer useful leverage in pressuring other countries to make concessions on trade and other issues.",
      "Trump administration officials also say critics of potential tariffs shouldn't view them in isolation, arguing that their other policies, including lowering taxes and easing regulations, will strengthen the economy.",
      "Companies are scrambling to prepare. Some bought goods and shipped them to the United States ahead of time to beat the tariffs. Others are calculating how much of the cost they can pass along to their customers. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going to impact a lot of consumers,\u2019\u2019 said Dave Evans, co-founder and CEO of Fictiv, a San Francisco company that helps clients manage their supply chains in plastics and metals. \u201cWe saw this in his first term. A tariff isn\u2019t fully absorbed by the companies.\u2019\u2019",
      "Canada and Mexico are bracing, too. Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister who represented Canada in USMCA negotiations, has called for retaliation if Trump moves ahead with tariffs. \u201cBeing smart means retaliating where it hurts,\u201d said Freeland, who is running to replace prime minister Justin Trudeau. \u201cOur counterpunch must be dollar-for-dollar \u2014 and it must be precisely and painfully targeted: Florida orange growers, Wisconsin dairy farmers, Michigan dishwasher manufacturers, and much more.\u201d",
      "Likewise, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum promised in November that \u201cfor every tariff, there will be a response in kind.\u2019\u2019",
      "A closer look at three industries that likely would bear the brunt of Trump\u2019s tariffs:",

      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt freeze of U.S. foreign aid is sending shockwaves through Eastern Europe, leaving pro-democracy groups, independent media, civil society initiatives and local governments scrambling to make ends meet in a region often defined by rivalries between East and West.",
      "The U.S. State Department said that the 90-day freeze aims to root out waste and block so-called woke programs to expose U.S.-funded activities \u201cthat run contrary to our national interests\u201d \u2014 as Trump aggressively rolls out his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",
      "Eastern Europe has been a longtime geopolitical battleground where Western foreign policy interests often collide with those of Moscow or Beijing.",

      "\u201cIn Moldova\u2019s case, foreign donor support is vital to balancing the media landscape,\" says Oxana Greadcenco, the director of independent media platform Moldova.org. \u201cMany television networks and media institutions are funded by Russia so there needs to be a counterbalance ... This is an unprecedented situation, but we are trying not to panic.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, informed her that grants officially ended on Jan. 24 and they aren\u2019t allowed to spend any remaining funds in their accounts. This week, Greadcenco promoted their online Patreon campaign, which garnered 135 new backers in two days, which should cover salaries for the platform\u2019s 16-strong staff through March, she said.",
      "\u201cWe did not expect it to impact Moldova so severely, as we thought there would only be a partial cut in funds,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \"Being aware of how much Moldova depends on U.S. funds, not just NGOs and the press but also local municipalities, many public institutions \u2026 this is a shock for everyone.\"",
      "Since the 1990s, USAID has invested several billion dollars in countries like Moldova, Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 all former communist countries with aspirations of joining the European Union.",
      "In these countries, USAID money has promoted democratic institutions and reforms, aided infrastructure and energy security projects, bolstered businesses and economies, and supported a significant number of nongovernmental organizations and independent media platforms. The agency says it \u201ctailors its approach to each country\u2019s unique challenges and opportunities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that we have democracy in Moldova, in part thanks to American financial support,\u201d Valeriu Pasa, the chairman of the Chisinau-based think-tank WatchDog, said in a statement on Wednesday. He added that the U.S. benefits \"from us being more democratic and developed, ensuring we don\u2019t turn into a Russian or Chinese colony.\u201d",

      "\u201cKosovo, but also our association \u2026 is dependent on foreign aid, mostly on U.S. aid,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we really do hope that this measure will be \u2026 canceled after 90 days,\u201d when the funding reviews by U.S. officials have concluded.",
      "Safet Gerxhaliu, an independent economic analyst in Kosovo, also believes the USAID freeze could have \u201ca very negative impact\u201d on the country\u2019s future, affecting everything from the government to the private sector and education.",
      "\u201cI do believe that the impact is very bad, because those measures come at the same time that Kosovo is under sanctions from the European community,\u201d he said. Brussels froze some funding to Kosovo in 2023 following a series of clashes with ethnic Serb minorities.",
      "Although Serbia obtained EU candidate status in 2012, the Balkan nation is also a key ally of Russia and China in Europe. Under the government of populist President Aleksandar Vucic, reforms in areas such as strengthening the rule of law and tackling corruption have been slow, and the USAID suspension could further hamper progress.",
      "\u201cWe currently have a USAID project about public financing. Training for local NGOs regarding following of public finances,\u201d Nemanja Nenadic from Transparency International organization in Serbia, told the AP. \u201cThis has been put on hold.\u201d",
      "For the Promo-LEX Association, a longtime pro-democracy and human rights NGO in Moldova, USAID funds are vital since they account for about 75-80% of its projects, which include monitoring elections, political financing and parliamentary oversight.",
      "\u201cAll USAID-funded activities have been put on hold. Without immediate alternative support, these crucial activities may not continue at the same scale or effectiveness,\u201d said Ion Manole, the association\u2019s executive director. \u201cGiven previous Russian interference \u2014 through illicit campaign funding, political corruption, and disinformation \u2014 our observation mission is essential to ensuring electoral transparency.\"",
      "Moldova will hold a pivotal parliamentary election this fall which comes after the pro-Western government accused Russia of meddling in two key votes last year \u2014 including backing a vast vote-buying scheme in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWithout resources, we cannot deploy long-term observers, conduct election-day monitoring, or track foreign interference effectively,\" Manole said. \u201cA change to an anti-Western government could affect Moldova\u2019s European path and ... significantly destabilize the whole of Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain hopeful that the U.S. government\u2019s evaluation process will allow programs like ours to resume,\u201d he said, adding that his NGO is already seeking alternative funding, mainly from European donors.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that any suspension of aid \u201cgives Russia an unnecessary opportunity to exploit and benefit further from Moldova\u2019s weaknesses, which the lack of USAID funding would exacerbate.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoscow would therefore have greater abilities to derail Chisinau from its European Union integration course,\u201d he said. \u201cSimilarly, cutting funding to independent news outlets makes it more difficult for journalists to hold corrupt politicians \u2014 many of whom have connections to Russia \u2014 accountable and therefore weakens Moldova\u2019s sovereignty and institutional independence.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has cast the aid freeze as an accountability quest to justify American spending abroad. Beyond support for Ukraine in recent years, the U.S. is spending about $40 billion in foreign aid annually, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "Greadcenco of the Moldova.org news platform hopes that other international partners will consider stepping in to stem a potential longer-term shortfall.",
      "\u201cThese funds are vital to keeping Moldova afloat,\u201d she said. \u201cI dread to think what the complete cessation of these funds would mean for our country.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Friday marks five years since Britain left the European Union at 11 p.m. on Jan. 31, 2020",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Five years ago Friday, two crowds of people gathered near Britain\u2019s Parliament \u2014 some with Union Jacks and cheers, others European Union flags and tears.",
      "On Jan. 31, 2020 at 11 p.m. London time \u2013 midnight at EU headquarters in Brussels \u2014 the U.K. officially left the bloc after almost five decades of membership that had brought free movement and free trade between Britain and 27 other European countries.",
      "For Brexit supporters, the U.K. was now a sovereign nation in charge of its own destiny. For opponents, it was an isolated and diminished country.",
      "It was, inarguably, a divided nation that had taken a leap into the dark. Five years on, people and businesses are still wrestling with the economic, social and cultural aftershocks.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been really quite profound,\u201d said political scientist Anand Menon, who heads the think-tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s changed our economy.",
      "\u201cAnd our politics has been changed quite fundamentally as well,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a new division around Brexit becoming part of electoral politics.\u201d",
      "An island nation with a robust sense of its historical importance, Britain had long been an uneasy member of the EU when it held a referendum in June 2016 on whether to remain or leave. Decades of deindustrialization, followed by years of public spending cuts and high immigration, made fertile ground for the argument that Brexit would let the U.K. \u201ctake back control\u201d of its borders, laws and economy.",
      "Yet the result \u2014 52% to 48% in favor of leaving \u2014 came as a shock to many. Neither the Conservative government, which campaigned to stay in the EU, nor pro-Brexit campaigners had planned for the messy details of the split.",
      "The referendum was followed by years of wrangling over divorce terms between a wounded EU and a fractious U.K. that caused gridlock in Parliament and ultimately defeated Prime Minister Theresa May. She resigned in 2019 and was replaced by Boris Johnson, who vowed to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t so simple.",
      "The U.K. left without agreement on its future economic relationship with the EU, which accounted for half the country\u2019s trade. The political departure was followed by 11 months of testy negotiations on divorce terms, culminating in agreement on Christmas Eve in 2020.",
      "The bare-bones trade deal saw the U.K. leave the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union. It meant goods could move without tariffs or quotas, but brought new red tape, costs and delays for trading businesses.",
      "\u201cIt has cost us money. We are definitely slower and it\u2019s more expensive. But we\u2019ve survived,\u201d said Lars Andersen, whose London-based company, My Nametags, ships brightly colored labels for kids\u2019 clothes and school supplies to more than 150 countries.",
      "To keep trading with the EU, Andersen has had to set up a base in Ireland, through which all orders destined for EU countries must pass before being sent on. He says the hassle has been worth it, but some other small businesses he knows have stopped trading with the EU or moved manufacturing out of the U.K.",
      "Julianne Ponan, founder and CEO of allergen-free food producer Creative Nature, had a growing export business to EU countries that was devastated by Brexit. Since then she has successfully turned to markets in the Middle East and Australia, something she says has been a positive outcome of leaving the EU.",
      "Having mastered the new red tape, she is now gradually building up business with Europe again.",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019ve lost four years of growth there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the sad part. We would be a lot further ahead in our journey if Brexit hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d",
      "The government\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that U.K. exports and imports will both be around 15% lower in the long run than if the U.K. had remained in the EU, and economic productivity 4% less than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Brexit supporters argue that short-term pain will be offset by Britain\u2019s new freedom to strike trade deals around the world. Since Brexit. the U.K. has signed trade agreements with countries including Australia, New Zealand and Canada.",
      "But David Henig, a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, said they have not offset the hit to trade with Britain\u2019s nearest neighbors.",
      "\u201cThe big players aren\u2019t so much affected,\u201d Henig said. \u201cWe still have Airbus, we still have Scotch whisky. We still do defense, big pharmaceuticals. But the mid-size players are really struggling to keep their exporting position. And nobody new is coming in to set up.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Brexit has not played out as either supporters or opponents anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine piled on more economic disruption, and made it harder to discern the impact of Britain\u2019s EU exit on the economy.",
      "In one key area, immigration, Brexit\u2019s impact has been the opposite of what many predicted. A desire to reduce immigration was a major reason many people voted to leave the EU, yet immigration today is far higher than before Brexit because the number of visas granted for workers from around the world has soared.",
      "Meanwhile, the rise of protectionist political leaders, especially newly returned U.S. President Donald Trump, has raised the stakes for Britain, now caught between its near neighbors in Europe and its trans-Atlantic \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe world is a far less forgiving place now than it was in 2016 when we voted to leave,\u201d Menon said.",
      "Polls suggest U.K. public opinion has soured on Brexit, with a majority of people now thinking it was a mistake. But rejoining seems a distant prospect. With memories of arguments and division still raw, few people want to go through all that again.",
      "Labour Party Prime Minister Keir Starmer, elected in July 2024, has promised to \u201creset\u201d relations with the EU, but has ruled out rejoining the customs union or single market. He\u2019s aiming for relatively modest changes such as a making it easier for artists to tour and for professionals to have their qualifications recognized, as well as on closer cooperation on law enforcement and security.",
      "EU leaders have welcomed the change of tone from Britain, but have problems of their own amid growing populism across the continent. The U.K. is no longer a top priority.",
      "\u201cI completely understand, it\u2019s difficult to get back together after quite a harsh divorce,\u201d said Andersen, who nonetheless hopes Britain and the EU will draw closer with time. \u201cI suspect it will happen, but it will happen slowly and subtly without politicians particularly shouting about it.\u201d",

      "Police boats have returned to the Potomac River as part of the recovery and investigation after the United States\u2019 deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Police boats combed the banks of the Potomac River on Friday morning, moving slowly and scanning the shoreline as part of the investigation into the midair collision that killed 67 people in the United States' deadliest aviation disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "More than 40 bodies have been pulled from the river as the massive recovery effort continued, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. The officials were not authorized to discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Crews worked under overcast skies Friday morning with rain expected throughout the day. Planes continued to take off and land at Reagan National, with airport operations gradually returning to normal after a slew of canceled and delayed flights following the crash.",
      "Investigators have already recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder of the American Airlines plane that collided with an Army helicopter as the plane was landing Wednesday night at Ronald Reagan National Airport next to Washington, D.C. Officials are scrutinizing a range of factors in what National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has called an \u201call-hands-on-deck event.\u201d",
      "All aboard the two aircraft were killed, with officials examining the actions of the military pilot as well as air traffic control after the helicopter apparently flew into the path of the American Airlines jet.",
      "Air crash investigations normally take 12-18 months, and investigators told reporters Thursday they would not speculate on the cause.",
      "Authorities were still looking for the helicopter's black box recorder, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday on Fox News Channel. Other factors in the crash, including the helicopter\u2019s altitude and whether the crew was using its night vision goggles, are still under investigation, Hegseth said.",
      "Although some of the airspace had already been restricted following the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration decided to indefinitely bar most helicopters from using the low-to-the-ground routes that run under or parallel to the airport\u2019s flightpaths, an official told the AP on Friday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.",
      "Military aircraft frequently conduct such flights in and around the nation\u2019s capital for familiarization with routes they would fly in case of a major catastrophe or an attack on the U.S. that would require relocation of key officials from the capital region.",
      "\u201cYou need to train as you fight, you need to rehearse in ways that would reflect a real world scenario,\u201d Hegseth said. He stressed that it remained the Pentagon\u2019s duty to also mitigate risks, while conducting such training. But he underscored U.S. forces need \u201cto ensure, if unfortunately, there were a real world event where things needed to happen we could respond to it day or night.\u201d",
      "The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew members, and three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.",
      "One air traffic controller was responsible for coordinating helicopter traffic and arriving and departing planes when the collision happened, according to a report by the FAA that was obtained by the AP. Those duties are often divided between two people, but the airport typically combines the roles at 9:30 p.m., once traffic begins to slow down. On Wednesday the tower supervisor directed that they be combined earlier.",
      "\u201cThe position configuration was not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic,\u201d the report said.",
      "A person familiar with the matter, however, said the tower staffing that night was at a normal level. The positions are regularly combined when controllers need to step away from the console for breaks, during shift changes or when air traffic is slow, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures.",
      "The FAA has long struggled with a shortage of air traffic controllers.",
      "Officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, carrying, among others, a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches, and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.",
      "A top Army aviation official said the crew of the helicopter, a Black Hawk, was \u201cvery experienced\u201d and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around the city.",
      "\u201cBoth pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn\u2019t something new to either one of them,\u201d said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation.",
      "The helicopter's maximum allowed altitude at the time was 200 feet (about 60 meters), Koziol said. It was not immediately clear whether it exceeded that limit, but Hegseth said altitude seemed to be a factor in the collision.",
      "Koziol said investigators need to analyze the flight data before making conclusions about altitude.",
      "President Donald Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform that the helicopter was \u201cflying too high\u201d at the time of the crash.",
      "\u201cIt was far above the 200 foot limit. That\u2019s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\u201d Trump said. His comments came a day after he questioned the helicopter pilot's actions while also blaming diversity initiatives for undermining air safety.",
      "Flights at Reagan National resumed around midday Thursday.",
      "Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight slammed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five people on the ground.",
      "The last major fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, along with one person on the ground, bringing the total death toll to 50.",
      "Experts often highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, however. The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "But the airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots no matter how ideal the conditions. They must navigate hundreds of other commercial planes, military aircraft and restricted areas around sensitive sites.",
      "Just over 24 hours before the fatal collision, a different regional jet had to go around for a second chance at landing at Reagan National after it was advised about a military helicopter nearby, according to flight tracking sites and control logs. It landed safely minutes later.",

      "Satellite analysis and on-the-ground visits found a rapid increase in land given over to mining pits in Raja Ampat Regency, a group of tropical islands near West Papua, according to the report from Auriga Nusantara, an environmental and conservation organization in Indonesia.",
      "A few degrees south of the equator, the islands are home to 75% of the world\u2019s coral species and over 1,600 fish species, including critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles and vulnerable reef manta rays. The regency has at least nine marine protected areas spread over nearly 2 million hectares (4.9 million acres), and was named a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2023, recognizing the international value of its geological heritage.",
      "Much of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more. Experts fear that continued expansion of mining \u2014 which more than tripled in the area the past five years \u2014 will lead to further deforestation, water pollution and disruption of the area's precious ecosystem.",
      "Auriga Nusantara's report found that land used for mining in Raja Ampat grew by about 494 hectares (about 1,220 acres) from 2020 through 2024. That was about three times the rate of expansion from the previous five years. The total permit area for mining in Raja Ampat \u2014 all for nickel \u2014 is more than 22,420 hectares, or about 55,400 acres.",
      "Felled trees and open pits of orange-brown gravel and earth scar the islands where mining has started, according to Auriga Nusantara. Sediment from the mines could also be seen along the islands\u2019 coasts as it was carried away by the ocean\u2019s current.",
      "\u201cAs long as the nickel mining continues to operate, the sediment will destroy coral and its surrounding ocean ecosystem,\u201d said Timer Manurung, the director of Auriga Nusantara. \u201dIt\u2019s really a threat for Raja Ampat, as the archipelago is known for ocean biodiversity and richness that makes it an international tourism destination.\u201d",
      "With the world\u2019s largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "New mining pits were located on at least four islands in the regency, according to the report. One island where mining has occurred is located within the UNESCO Global Geopark area.",

      "Local communities who rely on the area for their local livelihoods \u2014 including subsistence fishing for food and tourism-related activities for income \u2014 have said they've noticed decreased water quality since mining began, said marine ecologist Edy Setyawan, who works in Raja Ampat.",

    "story": [
      "Civil rights activists have gathered outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters to call for a boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Civil rights activists gathered outside the headquarters of Target Corp. on Thursday to call for a national boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target announced last Friday that it would join competitor Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back their DEI initiatives, which have come under attack from conservatives and the new White House of President Donald Trump.",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, a veteran civil rights lawyer in Minneapolis and founder of the Racial Justice Network, joined other local activists and their supporters at a news conference to urge people to begin the boycott on Saturday, the first day of Black History Month. Many of the participants were regular Target shoppers until now, she said.",
      "Levy Armstrong said they were \u201cstunned\u201d that Target, which increased its commitment to building a more diverse workforce in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in 2020, backed away from its support of racial equity.",
      "\u201cWe thought that they would hold the line. We thought that they would continue to stand for the values that we all hold dear,\u201d she said. \"But instead they acted cowardly, and they made the decision to bow down to the Trump administration. Well, we are here today saying we will not bow down. We will not step back, and we will not turn around.\u201d",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on Islamic-American Relations, said that as a company based in the city where Floyd's murder sparked a national reckoning with racial injustice, Target must be called out.",
      "\u201cWe here in Minneapolis today, the good people of the state, are saying to our friends all over the country, \u2018If you were moved to do something good after the murder of George Floyd, it is time for you to stand up and boycott Target,\u2019\u201d Hussein said.",
      "The organizers of the boycott include local Black Lives Matter groups. During the boycott announcement, some speakers cut up their distinctive red Target charge cards, while others called on DEI supporters to shop at Costco, which reaffirmed its commitment to DEI last week.",
      "Despite the anger with Target, the news conference-turned-rally took on a festive atmosphere, with a New Orleans-style brass band playing protest songs like Bob Marley's \u201cGet Up, Stand Up.\u201d Participants circled up for a prayer before the speeches began.",
      "Target, which long was viewed as a strong advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the call for a boycott. But in a memo to employees last week, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the company's decision to retire its diversity goals as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s human resource and customer engagement strategy.",
      "\u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Levy Armstrong said Target has not reached out to her or other local Black leaders. She said they expected more from Target, and now feel like everything it had done in support of people of color was just window dressing. The starting point for any conversation, she said, would be for the company reverse its decision immediately.",
      "\u201cTarget knows what its presence and its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion means to this community,\" Levy Armstrong said. \u201cSo that is why we are focusing on Target first. But that does not mean that those other businesses should not also be held accountable. All of those businesses should be held accountable, and they should not have access to our dollars.\u201d",

      "Ever since calls for a boycott began circulating on social media, the founders of several Black-owned businesses that sell their products in Target stores or through the company's online platforms have expressed concern that a broad boycott might hurt them.

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:54:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal Doug Burgum as North Dakota governor catered to the whims of oil and gas executives while leveraging those connections to expand his political profile",
    "story": [
      "Emails obtained by The Associated Press reveal Doug Burgum as North Dakota governor catered to the whims of oil and gas executives while leveraging those connections to expand his political profile",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- When North Dakota's petroleum association was going to hold a banquet honoring top fracking executives last year, it turned to Gov. Doug Burgum. The two-term Republican, now President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, co-hosted the event \u2014 at the governor's mansion.",
      "And when energy industry lobbyists were looking for help taking on Biden administration greenhouse gas rules, they also turned to Burgum. In an email to Burgum's office seeking the legal heft the state could provide, an industry lobbyist argued that \u201ccombating\u201d such regulations required \u201ca one-two punch\" from industry and government.",
      "While it is not surprising that the governor of the third-largest oil producing state would have a close relationship with fossil fuel producers, records obtained by the Associated Press reveal Burgum's administration eagerly assisted the industry even as the governor was profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies. And his assistance came at a time when Burgum was leaning on those very connections to build his national profile in the Republican Party.",
      "Now that he's been confirmed to run the Interior Department, Burgum will have vast control over federal lands, including the issuance of oil and gas leases, as well as a mandate from Trump to extract such resources even though the U.S. is producing record amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "Those ties concern Democrats and environmentalists who say his zeal to expand drilling was \u201ctroubling.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre you going to protect our resources, or are you going to \u2018drill, baby, drill?\u2019\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat, asked during Burgum's confirmation hearing this month.",
      "The selection of Burgum, who briefly pursued the presidency in 2023 before endorsing Trump, represents an abrupt pivot from Biden's emphasis on combating climate change. It also signals that Trump intends to follow through on a proposal made last spring when he urged oil and gas CEOs to donate $1 billion to his campaign in exchange for the dismantling of Biden's environmental agenda.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesman for Burgum declined to make him available for an interview.",
      "\u201cGovernor Burgum worked tirelessly to build a prosperous economy in North Dakota,\" spokesman Rob Lockwood said in a statement. \"This economic growth included sustainably developing natural resources. As governor, he met with job creators and leaders who generated opportunities for the people of North Dakota.\u201d",
      "Under the partisan glare of Washington, and faced with stricter federal ethics rules governing conflicts of interest, Burgum has pledged to sell his interest in his family\u2019s lease with the shale oil giant Continental Resources, as well as another one with Hess, a Chevron subsidiary. He has also pledged to sell stock held in a handful of energy companies, some of which he interacted with as governor, which are worth as much as $200,000 according to his 2023 financial disclosures.",
      "There is perhaps no better demonstration of Burgum\u2019s close ties to oil and gas producers than his friendship with Harold Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources who is responsible for much of North Dakota\u2019s fracking boom. The billionaire Oklahoma wildcatter advises Trump on energy policy and is widely viewed as playing a role in helping Burgum secure the nomination to lead Interior.",
      "Hamm did not respond to a request for comment made through his company.",
      "During his 2023 state-of-the-state speech, Burgum likened Hamm to Teddy Roosevelt for his \"grit, resilience, hard work and determination\" that he said \u201cchanged North Dakota and our nation.\u201d The shout-out came after Hamm had donated $50 million toward a library honoring Roosevelt in western North Dakota \u2014 a passion project of Burgum's.",
      "The documents obtained by AP reveal that several months later Hamm gifted Burgum a set of cuff links along with a note thanking Burgum for his \u201cfriendship\" and willingness to take a break from the \u201cgrueling task\u201d of running for president to speak at an energy conference that Hamm had hosted in Oklahoma City.",
      "These were not his only displays of patronage. Though Burgum, an independently wealthy former software company CEO, had a dim chance of winning the Republican presidential primary, Hamm's Continental Resources contributed $250,000 in the summer of 2023 to a super PAC supporting Burgum, campaign finance disclosures show. He also contributed to Burgum's campaign for governor.",
      "Emails between Burgum and Hamm's offices reveal the two communicated often.",
      "In a May 2020 email, Hamm's executive assistant asked if Burgum had time to talk with Hamm and shared a briefing document that railed against wind power, blasting wind turbines as a blight on \u201cour special places and sacred lands\u201d while excoriating tax breaks for wind energy providers as \"unconscionable.\"",
      "\u201cThis does NOTHING to Make America Great Again!\u201d the document states.",
      "Though Burgum set a goal in 2021 to make North Dakota carbon-neutral by 2030, he has adopted Hamm's tone. During his Senate confirmation hearing this month, he was dismissive of renewable energy, such as wind power, suggesting such sources were unreliable when compared to fossil fuels.",
      "In early 2023, as Hamm prepared to publish a memoir, Continental lobbyist Blu Hulsey emailed to ask if Burgum could write a blurb praising the book, the newly obtained records show. Burgum happily complied, heaping praise on the memoir, which the governor called \u201can inspiring story worthy of sharing.\u201d Burgum added that Hamm's impact was \"immeasurable.\u201d",
      "Ethics experts say there are other aspects of their relationship that pose a greater conflict of interest. As governor, Burgum never disclosed that his family leased roughly 200 acres of farmland to Continental for well drilling, as previously reported by CNBC. When Burgum ran for president and faced greater transparency requirements, he revealed making as much as $50,000 in royalties from Continental in 2023.",
      "Despite this relationship, Burgum routinely took action that benefited Hamm's company. As chairman of North Dakota's Industrial Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, he voted nearly a dozen times or more on measures that had favorable outcomes for Continental, records show.",
      "\u201cNorth Dakota is a leading energy producing state,\" Lockwood, the Burgum spokesman said. \"Tens of thousands of families and mineral owners have similar arrangements. As the publicly available disclosures show: the cited agreement began many years before he became governor.\u201d",
      "Burgum also used the governor's office to support a proposed pipeline that received $250 million in financial backing from Hamm. If completed, it will transport earth-warming CO2 gas that is the byproduct of ethanol fuel production to North Dakota, where it will be stored deep underground. It\u2019s been touted as a way to decarbonize the atmosphere, but has also run into stiff resistance from landowners, who fear their property will be seized to complete the project.",
      "Sarah Vogel, a Democrat and former North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner who previously sat on the commission, said Burgum seemed more like a cheerleader of the industry than a regulator.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he had a regulator\u2019s mindset. He had a promoter\u2019s mindset, which has probably made him beloved in the oil and gas industry,\u201d Vogel said.",
      "Hamm is not the only oil executive or lobbyist who has cultivated ties with Burgum, emails and office schedules show. Ryan Berger, a lobbyist for Occidental Petroleum, emailed Burgum's staff last year seeking a meeting for Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub after Burgum moderated a panel she participated in at an oil industry conference.",
      "\u201cIn an ideal world, a face-to-face over lunch or dinner would be amazing,\u201d Berger wrote in a May 2024 email. He added that Hollub had recently discussed energy issues \u201cdirectly with President Trump\u201d and \u201cwe thought you would benefit from hearing from her\u201d to see \u201cif there are mutually shared policies and perspectives that could be amplified this year.\u201d",
      "Berger declined to comment on the email. Lockwood, the spokesman, declined to say if Burgum had a meeting with Hollub happened.",
      "The records revealed that a Who's Who of oil executives had calls scheduled with Burgum. The include: CEOs of Chevron and Exxon; Marathon Oil officials had an audience with Burgum in 2022; and the governor also spoke before the Hess Corporation's board of directors' dinner. Burgum's family also has an oil lease with Hess that paid him as much as $1,000 in 2023, according to his financial disclosure.",
      "Burgum turned down an invitation to address an American Petroleum Institute convention in Washington, the records show, but agreed to speak at a private dinner for the American Exploration and Production Council in 2023, which drew top executives from Conoco Phillips, Devon Energy, Hilcorp and others.",
      "When Burgum was a leading contender last year to be Trump's vice presidential pick, he co-hosted a banquet at the governor's mansion with the North Dakota Petroleum Council that drew fracking industry heavy hitters, lobbyists and executives. Burgum, Hamm and Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy who is now Trump's pick for energy secretary, addressed attendees as they dined on beef, walleye cakes and bourbon caramel-topped cobbler.",
      "On Inauguration Day, after he had been named by Trump to lead Interior, Burgum declined an invitation to a party at the posh Hay-Adams Hotel that was hosted by Hamm and a number of petroleum trade associations and oil companies.",
      "Burgum\u2019s presence may not have been missed. Many of those executives and lobbyists, who will have business before the Interior Department, have shown they know how to reach him.",

      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including how the bond market reacts to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low just above 6% last September, but has been mostly rising since then, echoing a sharp rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 3.62% in mid-September, reached 4.79% two weeks ago amid fears inflation may remain stubbornly higher than the Fed's 2% target. A solid U.S. economy and worries about tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump have also helped push bond yields higher.",

That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. But you\u2019ve done more than that in the last four years, more than anyone can imagine.\u201d",
      "Clark reflected before the game on her time with the Hawkeyes, when she was part of teams that reached four NCAA tournaments and won three Big Ten Tournament titles.",
      "\u201cThe winning came because of the great culture that we had,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, I hope that\u2019s the thing that always stays intact, and I know it will, because of the great coaching staff we have and the type of players that they are here. We had players that were selfless. We had players that didn\u2019t care how many points you were going to score. They\u2019re going to do whatever they could for your teammates. They were going to hold their teammates accountable. And I think that\u2019s a lost art in college these days, and you don\u2019t always see that.\u201d",
      "Clark knows she is in a constant media spotlight these days, whether it\u2019s attending concerts or joining Taylor Swift in a suite at a Kansas City Chiefs NFL playoff game. She said she understands the criticism that comes with the attention.",
      "\u201cI feel like one of my greatest skills is I really don\u2019t care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI don\u2019t care \u2014 I believe in myself. I\u2019m confident in myself. I\u2019m confident in my teammates. I try to instill that in them. I\u2019m confident in the coaching staff on whatever team I was on, whether that was here, whether that\u2019s with the Fever now, and you just rely on those people. Nobody gets to step inside of your locker room. Everybody thinks they know everything and have an answer, but that\u2019s just not reality.\u201d",
      "Clark's jersey was hung in the rafters on the same day that South Carolina retired A'ja Wilson's jersey. They both wore 22 in college.",

      "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company designs and supplies the advanced computer chips that play an integral role in developing artificial intelligence.",
      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he might continue and harden Biden\u2019s approach.",
      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",
      "Trump said it was a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China. DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",
      "Countries such as Singapore, they added, should be subject to strict licensing requirements if they aren't willing to \u201ccrack down\u201d on China using their country as an intermediary for shipments.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nvidia said that its revenue associated with Singapore \"does not indicate diversion to China.\"",
      "\u201cOur public filings report \u2018bill to\u2019 not \u2018ship to\u2019 locations of our customers,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said. \u201cMany of our customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the U.S. and the west. We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "The unsolved death of a teenager in 1977 haunted students and staff at Honolulu's McKinley High School for nearly half a century",
      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

      "The iPhone\u2019s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year\u2019s October-December period wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device\u2019s AI features didn\u2019t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn\u2019t available in many markets outside the U.S.",
      "The countries still awaiting Apple\u2019s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground.",
      "Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion.",
      "Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple\u2019s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year.",
      "Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone\u2019s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple\u2019s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp.",
      "The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple\u2019s other products may not boost the company\u2019s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June.",
      "The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple\u2019s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple\u2019s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible.",
      "Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn\u2019t been investing as heavily in AI \u2013 one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek\u2019s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum.",
      "Apple\u2019s services division remained the company\u2019s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google\u2019s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly."

      "The Justice complaint alleges that Hewlett Packer Enterprise, under increased competitive pressure from the fast-rising Juniper, was forced to discount products and services and invest more in its own innovation, eventually leading the company to simply buy its rival.",
      "The lawsuit said that the combination of businesses would eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation.",
      "HPE and Juniper issued a joint statement Thursday, saying the companies strongly oppose the DOJ's decision.",

      "The Justice Department's intervention \u2014 the first of the new administration and just 10 days after Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 comes as somewhat of a surprise.

      "The Justice Department said that Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper are the U.S.'s second- and third-largest providers of wireless local area network (WLAN) products and services for businesses.",
      "\u201cThe proposed transaction between HPE and Juniper, if allowed to proceed, would further consolidate an already highly concentrated market \u2014 and leave U.S. enterprises facing two companies commanding over 70% of the market,\u201d the complaint said, adding that Cisco Systems was the industry leader.",
      "Many businesses and investors accused Biden regulatory agencies of antitrust overreach and were looking forward to a friendlier Trump administration.",
      "Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block a $24.6 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons that would have been the largest grocery store merger in U.S. history. Two judges agreed with the FTC\u2019s case, blocking the proposed deal in December.",

      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

      "NEW YORK -- The New York architect facing murder charges in a string of deaths known as the Gilgo Beach killings is challenging the DNA evidence against him and seeking separate trials in the sprawling case.",
      "Rex Heuermann\u2019s lawyers argue DNA analysis relied on by prosecutors is not widely accepted in the scientific community and should be excluded from the trial. The Long Island resident's defense team also wants to break out the case against him into multiple trials.",
      "Since late 2010, police have been investigating the deaths of at least 10 people \u2014 mostly female sex workers \u2014 whose remains were discovered along an isolated highway not far from Gilgo Beach on Long Island\u2019s south shore.",
      "Heuermann was arrested in 2023 and charged in the deaths of three of the victims between 2009 and 2010: Melissa Barthelemy, Amber Lynn Costello and Megan Waterman.",
      "While in custody, he was subsequently charged in the deaths of Valerie Mack in 2000, Jessica Taylor in 2003, Maureen Brainard-Barnes in 2007 and Sandra Costilla in 1993.",
      "Huermann has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty to all counts.",
      "Michael Brown, Heuermann's attorney, said following a Wednesday court hearing that his client risks being improperly convicted because of the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the evidence put forward by prosecutors.",
      "He also argued there\u2019s a \u201csubstantial disparity\u201d in the evidence in the some of the deaths, which he maintained involves different time frames, killing methods and locations for disposing the bodies.",
      "\u201cThe danger of having count after count, victim after victim in the same trial is that 'If there's smoke, there\u2019s fire' mentality,\" Brown said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be tried together. One issue has nothing to do with the other.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors on Wednesday filed a written response to the DNA challenge and said they will respond to the motion for separate trials later. Heuermann\u2019s next court date is Feb. 18.",
      "DNA results from hair strands found at some of the crime scenes are among the key pieces of evidence prosecutors have put forward in the case.",
      "Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney has maintained the DNA science is sound and that his office will oppose separate trials.",
      "In their Wednesday filing, prosecutors argued that the \u201cwhole genome sequencing\u201d technique utilized in the case has been accepted in peer-reviewed scientific journals and by federal regulators, paleontologists, virologists, and medical communities.",
      "The findings by Astrea Forensics, a California lab, were also independently corroborated by mitochondrial DNA testing, a methodology long accepted by New York courts, prosecutors said.",
      "Whole genome sequencing \u201cenables more comprehensive collection and evaluation of DNA,\u201d prosecutors wrote. It is \u201cso widely used for scientific, medical, and forensic purposes, it would seem there is little question as to whether it has been accepted in the relevant scientific community.\"",
      "Prosecutors also say Heuermann kept a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his alleged crimes on his computer that included a series of checklists with tasks to complete before, during and after the killings, as well as practical lessons for \u201cnext time.\u201d"

      "The turtles arrived in Juno Beach on Friday from the Marine Science Center in Volusia County, Florida.

      "It shows the copyright office will continue to reject copyright claims for fully machine-generated content. A person simply prompting a chatbot or AI image generator to produce a work doesn't give that person the ability to copyright that work, according to the report. \"Extending protection to material whose expressive elements are determined by a machine ... would undermine rather than further the constitutional goals of copyright,\u201d Perlmutter said.",

      "What started as a COVID-era necessity has become one of the festival\u2019s most beloved components, even for those who do brave the cold and the lines to see films in person.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great to be able to offer that opportunity to our audiences, but also to our artists. Sundance is a festival of discovery and each of the films coming to the festival is seeking that moment with audiences,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cHow cool is it that even for that short window of time, just a few days, folks from anywhere in the country can log on in their living room with family and friends, get together and watch a few of the films?\u201d",

      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",

These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",

      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",

      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "Darren Beattie is the acting under secretary in a top State Department role.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration is filling one of the State Department\u2019s top positions with a controversial conservative journalist who has promoted conspiracy theories related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and was fired as a speechwriter by the first Trump administration when it was revealed that he had spoken at a conference tied to White nationalists, sources familiar with the move told ABC News.",
      "The sources said that the man, Darren Beattie, will now be the acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, a so-called \u201cTop 10\u201d position that, as the State Department\u2019s website describes it, \u201cleads America\u2019s public diplomacy outreach, which includes messaging to counter terrorism and violent extremism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Under Secretary oversees the bureaus of Educational and Cultural Affairs and Global Public Affairs, and participates in foreign policy development,\u201d the website adds.",
      "Beattie is slated to start in the position on Monday, sources said. He was already serving in another senior role within the State Department, but the new move to such a high-level position has raised concerns among many of its employees, sources said.",
      "More than two years ago, Beattie launched a right-wing media outlet called Revolver News, which has raised funds in part by selling pro-Trump apparel and merchandise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to deny 2020,\u201d reads two shirts still being sold on the outlet\u2019s website. Another shirt promotes the refuted claim that Jan. 6, 2021, was an \"FBI setup to frame Trump supporters as insurrectionists,\" as the shirt says.",
      "And Beattie has become a frequent guest on other right-wing media, often promoting conspiracy theories related to Jan. 6.",
      "On Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s podcast last month, Beattie repeated his claims that the FBI knows who\u2019s behind the pipe bombs left at DNC and RNC offices on Jan. 6 but \u201cwhat they found out was profoundly embarrassing to the government and to the narrative that the Biden regime wanted to promote, and so instead of following that investigation further, they basically just killed it,\u201d Beattie said.",
      "Beattie also claimed that surveillance video released by the FBI to seek help in identifying the perpetrator was \u201cclearly tampered with.\u201d",
      "In mid-August 2018, he made national headlines, with the Washington Post reporting then that he \u201cwas terminated last week after revelations that he had spoken at a conference attended by well-known white nationalists\u201d two years earlier.",
      "According to the Washington Post, Beattie \u2013 who is Jewish \u2013 insisted that he was not racist and said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2016 I attended the [H.L. Mencken Club] conference in question and delivered a stand-alone, academic talk titled \u2018The Intelligentsia and the Right.\u2019 I said nothing objectionable and stand by my remarks completely,\" the statement said. \"It was the honor of my life to serve in the Trump Administration. I love President Trump, who is a fearless American hero, and continue to support him one hundred percent.\u201d",
      "At the end of the Trump administration, in November 2020, the Trump White House appointed Beattie to a three-year term with the Commission for the Preservation of America\u2019s Heritage Abroad, which helps preserve sites related to the Holocaust.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League strongly objected to the appointment, issuing a statement at the time saying, \u201cIt is absolutely outrageous that someone who has consorted with racists would even be considered for a position on a commission devoted to preserving Holocaust memorials in Europe.\u201d",
      "The New York Times then asked Beattie for comment, and he told the paper: \u201cThe ADL pretends to be an organization that protects Jews, but it really exists to protect Democrats. As a Jewish Trump supporter, I consider it an honor to be attacked by the far-left ADL and its disgraced leader, Jonathan Greenblatt.\u201d",
      "Asked about Beattie\u2019s new position at the State Department, a White House spokesperson referred ABC News to the State Department. First reached on Friday, the State Department has so far not commented.",

    "summary": "Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America.",
    "story": [
      "The trip is Rubio's first as America's top diplomat.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America over the first week of February.",
      "During the trip, Rubio is expected to reinforce the Trump administration's immigration priorities with leaders in the region, according to a senior official, who said the secretary is also planning to address Beijing's influence during several of the stops.",
      "The State Department is also billing Rubio's trip as historic -- saying his six-day journey to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic marks the first time a U.S. secretary of state has opted to make his or her first official visit to Latin America in over 100 years.",
      "\"This is where we live\"",
      "In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Rubio said the trip is part of a realignment of American diplomatic priorities.",
      "\"For many reasons, U.S. foreign policy has long focused on other regions while overlooking our own. As a result, we've let problems fester, missed opportunities and neglected partners,\" he said. \"That ends now.\"",
      "State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the region's proximity to the United States was an important factor in selecting it for Rubio's first trip.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is, this is where we live. This is who we are,\" she said. \"This is about not just wanting to have new partnerships -- but that's always good -- but the nature of what it means to have an extended relationship with the people closest to you.\"",
      "Those relationships are vital for fulfilling the Trump administration's border security and deportation plans, Rubio noted.",
      "\"Diplomacy's role in this effort is central. We need to work with countries of origin to halt and deter further migrant flows, and to accept the return of their citizens present in the U.S. illegally,\" he said.",
      "Cooperation and coercion",
      "However, the countries on his itinerary have largely been very cooperative with the administration so far, as other countries in the region Rubio will skip over remain hesitant to comply.",
      "Guatemala, for instance, has accepted hundreds of migrants brought to the country on military planes since Trump took office, and the country's leadership has signaled it is open to accepting deportees of other nationalities.",
      "Meanwhile, Mexico, which is traditionally the U.S.' most important partner in handling illegal immigration, has been much more tentative.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum originally said the country wouldn't accept migrants from other countries, but she quietly reversed course in late January when she revealed Mexico had accepted over 4,000 deportees and that while \"the large majority\" was Mexican, others were not.",
      "Mexico has also so far refused requests from the U.S. to allow military flights carrying deportees to land in the country, according to officials from both countries.",
      "Honduras has posed another challenge to the administration's agenda. According to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the end of 2024, Hondurans made up the largest share of the population in the deportation pipeline. But ahead of Trump's inauguration, the president of Honduras threatened to expel members of the U.S. military stationed in the country in response to mass deportations of Honduran nationals.",
      "However, Honduran authorities have signaled the country's position may be softening. The country's foreign minister wrote on X that the government is in the process of launching a program to support returning migrants called \"Brother, Come Home.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also had some early success in overtly pressuring countries to acquiesce. His threatened trade war against Colombia prompted its government to allow military deportation flights to land on its territory.",
      "\"It sends a message that this administration, President Trump, Secretary Rubio -- they mean what they say,\" said Mauricio Claver-Carone, special envoy for Latin America.",
      "Claver-Carone also suggested the Trump administration would use gentler diplomatic tactics as well, saying that during Rubio's trip, he will attempt to lay the groundwork for a program to repatriate migrants travelling through Central America with the government of Costa Rica.",
      "He also addressed Richard Grenell's visit to Venezuela to meet with strongman Nicolas Maduro on Friday.",
      "\"President Trump expects Nicolas Maduro to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to United States and to do so unequivocally and without condition,\" he said, adding that Grenell, the envoy for special missions, will also urge Maduro to release American hostages held in the country.",
      "A \"direct threat\" from China",
      "Beyond immigration, Claver-Carone said Beijing's growing influence in Central America will also be top of mind for Rubio through much of the trip, but it is expected to take center stage during the secretary's first stop in Panama.",
      "Trump has lodged a litany of complaints related to Panama's operation of the canal that cuts through the country -- claiming that American vessels are overcharged, lamenting that the U.S. ceded control of the vital waterway in the first place and promising \"we're taking it back\" during his inaugural address.",
      "Rubio has taken a more measured approach in discussing the Panama Canal while also underscoring that what he says are Trump's legitimate concerns about the waterway -- especially when it comes to companies controlled by Beijing located on each end of it.",
      "\"If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to,\" Rubio said in an interview on Thursday. \"That is a direct threat.\"",
      "Rubio continued to say it is a dynamic that cannot be allowed to continue.",
      "\"It is not in the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a leverage and a weapon against us. That can't happen,\" he said.",
      "But ahead of Rubio's visit, Panama President Jose Raul Mulino said handing back control of the canal isn't a thought he can entertain.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" Mulino said during a press conference on Thursday. \"I cannot negotiate, and much less open, a process of negotiation over the canal. That's sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.\"",

      "\"The only conclusion I know is last night we met with several hundred family members who lost their loved ones in the Potomac,\" he said. \"We don't need that to happen anymore. ... We're going to find out what happened, and we're going to try to stop it from happening again.\"",
      "Trump was asked by a reporter on Friday if he had any concerns that his comments could interfere with the investigation.",
      "\"No, I think they'll do an investigation. It'll probably come out the way I said it,\" Trump responded. \"I'd like to put it up front. I'm so tired of listening to things happen to our country and then people say we'll do an investigation. And three years later, they come up with a report that nobody looks at, especially not in all cases.\"",
      "Trump accused former President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama of hiring air traffic controllers based on diversity goals.",
      "\"I put safety first -- Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first, and they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen,\" Trump claimed at Thursday's news conference.",
      "When pressed by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce what proof he had that the crash was caused by DEI efforts, Trump responded: \"It just could have been.\"",
      "DEI or any similar program does not apply to hiring for air traffic control, which requires rigorous health examinations and a multiyear training process. Applicants must pass a medical exam, an aptitude test and a psychological test that is more stringent than that required of a pilot, said Chris Wilbanks, FAA deputy vice president of safety and technical training.",
      "Trump pointed to a New York Post article as he accused Democrats of pushing to hire people with severe mental disabilities at the Federal Aviation Administration. But the diversity language referenced in the article was on the FAA website during the entirety of Trump\u2019s first term and has been on the site for more than a decade, according to Snopes.",
      "Trump's attacks, though, are in line with his agenda to dismantle DEI from the federal government. In his first week in office, he signed multiple orders to place federal employees working on DEI on administrative leave and to remove DEI efforts from the Pentagon.",
      "Democrats pushed back on Trump's claims about the crash.",
      "\"Listen, it's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories. It's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families still being notified,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Thursday. \"It just turns your stomach.\"",
      "Pete Buttigieg, Biden's transportation secretary and another target of Trump's criticism in the wake of the crash, called Trump's comments \"despicable.\"",
      "\"President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,\" Buttigieg wrote in a social media post. \"One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.\"",

      "The White House's Office of Personnel Management had told government workers in an email Tuesday that if they quit by Feb. 6, they would still get paid through Sept. 30.",
      "Employment lawyers questioned whether such an offer was lawful because Congress, not the White House, is responsible for authorizing workers' paychecks. Many agencies are expected to run out of money this spring, with the federal government only funded through March, raising questions about how the Trump administration can promise those who take the buyouts would still get paid if the executive branch doesn't control spending.",
      "Many federal workers also wondered whether the memo, titled \"A Fork in the Road,\" was a phishing scam, prompting OPM to release a new memo assuring workers they are \"most welcome [to] stay at home and relax or to travel to your dream destination. Whatever you would like.\"",
      "On Friday morning, senior officials at the various agencies sent memos to staffers assuring them the offers were indeed real.",
      "\"On behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), I am informing you that the offer is valid, lawful, and will be honored by USDA,\" said one such memo signed by Kailee Tkacz Buller, chief of staff at the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\"If you accept the deferred resignation offer, you will receive pay and benefits through September 30, 2025, and will not be subject to a reduction-in-force or other premature separation,\" she wrote.",
      "However, Max Alonzo, the national secretary-treasurer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, a labor union that represents 110,000 federal workers, said his union is advising federal workers not to respond to the email.",
      "In part, he said, the union is worried about the lack of clarity and specifics in the offer email. He pointed to the lack of a contract and the fact that Congress has not allocated funds for large-scale federal buyouts, and he worried people might offer to resign but not actually be paid in the end or may have their benefits stripped.",
      "\"Absolutely do not resign. There is nothing that says that the day that you resign, that they can't just let you go,\" he said. \"They don't have to pay you -- there's nothing that says they have to pay you till Sept. 30. This is nothing that has been done before. This is not in our regulations. There's no regs about it. We're not even sure if it's actually legal. So, yeah, absolutely do not resign.\"",
      "The buyout offers come as President Donald Trump has pushed for federal employees to return to working in person, signing an executive order on his first day in office calling for an end to teleworking.",
      "However, the email went to many workers across the country who never had telework agreements, including firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and nurses at hospitals with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and many remain skeptical about the intention of the offer and ramifications for those who reply.",
      "Asked about the buyout offers in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was blunt, saying, \"We'd love to have them leave.\"",
      "\"We're trying to reduce government,\" Trump added, noting that he didn't know how many people had taken the offer but that it would become clear on Feb. 6, when the offer expires.",
      "\"Nobody knows how that's going to turn out,\" Trump said. \"Everybody's replaceable, and we'll get very good people to replace them if it turns out to be more than we thought it could be.\"",

      "The order was rescinded following legal challenges and intense backlash amid widespread confusion and disruptions to critical services like Medicaid.",
      "And now, amid the fallout, finger pointing has begun inside the administration, sources said, with the attention turning to Mark Paoletta, OMB's general counsel, who played a key role in drafting the order.",
      "Top White House policy adviser Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf were among those who had been left out of the review process, sources said.",
      "The fallout has already led to discussions about reassigning Paoletta away from his position as OMB's general counsel, though no final decision has been made, according to multiple sources.",
      "Sources said senior advisers were caught off guard and frustrated that they had not reviewed the memo before its release, seeing its rollout as a stain on what had otherwise been smooth messaging around President Donald Trump's rapid rollout of executive orders.",
      "Meanwhile, some rank-and-file officials at OMB were themselves left confused both when the memo was issued and after it was rescinded, sources said.",
      "OMB officials did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "On Wednesday, a federal judge signaled he would issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants. That's now raised concerns that the White House will try to enact the same policy described in the now-rescinded memo.",
      "District Judge John McConnell Jr. had harsh words for the Trump administration following a social media post by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in which Leavitt said it was the memo that was being rescinded, not the freeze itself.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" Leavitt posted on X, defending the policy after the memo was rescinded. \"It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Despite the Office of Management rescinding their directive, Judge McConnell said he believed there was \"sufficient evidence\" that the government still plans to carry out the policy based on Leavitt's social media post.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans could feel \u201csome pain\u201d from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, and claimed that Canada would \u201ccease to exist\u201d without its trade surplus with the United States.",
      "The trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort caused a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty, and threatened to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China. But by following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year's election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation.",
      "\u201cWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cBUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\u201d",
      "His administration has not said how high that price could be or what improvements would need to be seen in stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of fentanyl to merit the removal of the tariffs that Trump imposed under the legal justification of an economic emergency. The tariffs are set to launch Tuesday.",
      "In his Truth Social post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, which responded with retaliatory measures. Trump is placing a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, with a 10% tax on oil, natural gas and electricity. Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on more than $155 billion on U.S. products, including alcohol and fruit.",
      "Trump railed against Canada's trade surplus with the United States: \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s claim that the U.S does not need Canada, one-quarter of the oil that the America consumes per day is from its ally to the north.",
      "Trump contended that without that surplus, \"Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\u201d",
      "Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year, but noted that one-third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports and that there is a deficit when oil prices are high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is encouraging Canadians to buy more Canadian goods, and says Trump's moves will only cause pain across North America. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is going to have real consequences for people, for workers on both sides of our border,\" Trudeau said Saturday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here. We didn\u2019t ask for this but we will not back down in standing up both for Canadians and for the incredible successful relationship between Canada and the United States.\u201d",

      "The Chinese government said it would take steps to defend its economic interests and intends to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization.",
      "For Trump, the open question is whether inflation could be a political pressure point that would cause him to back down. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly hammered Democrats over the inflation under President Joe Biden that resulted from supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic, the Biden administration\u2019s own spending to spur the recovery and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump said his previous four years as president had low inflation, so the public should expect the same if he came back to the White House. But he also said specifically that higher inflation would stagger the U.S. as a nation, a position from which he now appears to be retreating with the tariffs.",
      "\u201cInflation is a disaster,\u201d he said at a Philadelphia campaign rally. \u201cIt\u2019s a country-buster. It\u2019s a total country-buster.\u201d",
      "Outside analyses make clear that Trump's tariffs would hurt the voters that he intended to help, meaning that he might ultimately need to find a resolution.",
      "An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows, if the tariffs were to continue, an average U.S. household would lose roughly $1,245 in income this year, in what would be the overall equivalent of a more than $1.4 trillion tax increase over the next 10 years.",
      "Goldman Sachs, in a Sunday analyst note, stressed that the tariffs go into effect on Tuesday, which means they're likely to proceed \u201cthough a last-minute compromise cannot be completely ruled out.\u201d",
      "The investment bank concluded that because of the possible economic damage and possible conditions for removal that \u201cwe think it is more likely that the tariffs will be temporary but the outlook is unclear.\u201d",

      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- Families of victims of the deadliest U.S. air disaster in nearly 25 years visited the crash site Sunday just outside Washington, D.C.",
      "Dozens of people walked along the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport, close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard.",
      "They arrived in buses with a police escort, memorializing loved ones as federal investigators work to piece together the events that led to the crash and recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.",
      "But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on morning TV news programs.",
      "\u201cWhat was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? \u2026 The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?\u201d Duffy asked on CNN.",
      "The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged to the Potomac River after colliding.",
      "The plane\u2019s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.",
      "Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "Data from the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters), when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.",
      "The discrepancy has yet to be explained.",
      "Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter\u2019s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what our job is, to figure that out,\u201d NTSB member Todd Inman said.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex investigation,\u201d investigator in charge Brice Banning said. \u201cThere are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.\u201d",
      "Banning said the jet\u2019s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.",
      "\u201cThe crew had a verbal reaction,\u201d Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed \u201cthe airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.\u201d",
      "Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.",
      "Inman said he spent hours meeting with victims\u2019 families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.",
      "\u201cSome wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,\u201d Inman said. \u201cThey are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.\u201d",
      "The remains of 42 people had been pulled from the river as of Saturday afternoon, including 38 that have been positively identified, officials said. They expect to recover all of the remains, though the plane\u2019s fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get the rest.",
      "More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.",
      "On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.",
      "Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.",
      "According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic.

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

      "Independent journalists live outside the mainstream and their numbers are growing",
      "First word of the Trump administration's since-rescinded order to freeze spending on federal loans and grants came not from a major news organization, but from a woman working alone in her Brooklyn apartment.",
      "Marisa Kabas' scoop this past week was a key moment for a growing cadre of journalists who work independently to gather and analyze news and market themselves as brands. Many are refugees from legacy outlets while others are scrappy newcomers like Kabas, who found traditional career paths unappealing or out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis week has been career-changing,\u201d Kabas said in an interview. \u201cIn a sense, my job has changed overnight.\u201d",
      "She was sitting at her kitchen table last Monday, sifting through emails on her laptop, when a source forwarded her a copy of a memo announcing the freeze sent by the Office of Management and Budget's acting director. Kabas has her own website, the Handbasket, but to give the story wider visibility, she posted a screen shot of the memo on the social media site Bluesky.",
      "Then she waited.",
      "Her stomach was in knots. She calmed herself with a walk on a frigid night. Despite her belief in independent journalism \u2014 and her own work \u2014 she recognized that to many, news only becomes \u201creal\u201d when it appears in a major outlet. Three hours later, The Washington Post published its story, with a hat-tip to Kabas.",
      "The directive caused such an uproar that the administration walked back its order two days later.",
      "Kabas, 37, kicked around in various journalism and publicist jobs and freelanced for outlets like MSNBC.com, the Huffington Post and New Republic. She started her website in 2022 primarily for personal writing and decided to go \u201call in\u201d with journalism the next year.",
      "The advantage to going it alone is that \u201cI get to write about things that I care about,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't have to work on assignments that are given to me that I don't care about.\u201d The down side is she's all alone, dependent upon her own hustle.",
      "Kabas wrote on ex-congressman George Santos, the raid on a weekly newspaper in Kansas and Elon Musk, although much of her writing was essays instead of reported work.",
      "Like many in the independent journalism world, she doesn't hide her opinions. She wrote that the OMB memo was \"a truly unhinged document that sounds like it was written by the world's most petty 4Chan poster.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's got attitude, she's got personality,\u201d said Greg Munno, a journalism professor at Syracuse University. \u201cI think attitude and personality help these independent journalists connect with readers and potentially sources.\u201d",
      "A wide variety of independent journalists have made their mark, often working on publishing platforms like Substack and Beehiiv.",
      "Seamus Hughes' Court Watch pulls together interesting legal documents from around the country. Heather Cox Richardson's Letters From an American explores the intersection of history and today's politics. Peter Geoghegan's Democracy for Sale investigates money in politics.",
      "Casey Newton, a former editor at The Verge, looks at the tech world on Platformer, and this past week urged people worried about the A.I. company DeepSeek to take \u201ca few long, deep breaths.\u201d Molly Knight's The Long Game writes smartly about sports and even admits to her clunkers, like recently revisiting her prediction that the Texas Rangers would repeat as American League champions.",
      "Oliver Darcy left CNN to break news and offer commentary about the media on his own site, Status. Two former Washington Post journalists have set up their own shops: opinion writer Jennifer Rubin's site, The Contrarian, boasts the tagline \u201cNot owned by anybody,\u201d and tech writer Taylor Lorenz's User Mag broke its own news last week on conservative influencer Candace Owens' new venture.",
      "Days ago, CNN anchor Jim Acosta announced he was setting up shop at Substack after quitting the network rather than accept a transfer to a middle-of-the-night time slot.",
      "\u201cIndependent journalism is now the way forward,\u201d Dan Rather, the former CBS News anchor and perhaps quintessential old-school journalist, posted on Facebook Thursday. \u201cSadly, we can no longer rely on legacy media to hold the powerful accountable.\u201d",
      "Expand the definition of independent journalist more broadly, and you can include the exploding world of podcasts, many of which played a key role in the presidential election, and TikTok or YouTube influencers who comment on the news.",
      "The more that traditional news outlets shrink or die, \u201csomething is going to fill that gap,\u201d said Jeremy Littau, a Lehigh University journalism professor. \u201cThere is going to be a need for it.\u201d",
      "It's exciting for those who seek variety and new voices, particularly with legacy media lagging in public esteem. The danger comes in figuring out who to trust in a world where a single person often performs the role of reporter, editor, sales person and business manager.",
      "That's particularly important with breaking news, Littau said. Who is out there cutting corners, or repackaging things they see online without the standards that a traditional news organization imposes?",
      "Munno is skeptical about how much support there is in the marketplace.",
      "\u201cI don't think the consumer's appetite for news is high enough to support a really deep pool of independent journalists that would be able to create an audience and make a living,\u201d he said.",
      "Kabas cobbled together what she considered a typical journalist's living \u2014 translation: modest \u2014 before this past week. Her earnings through the Handbasket come through subscribers who pay $8 a month or $80 annually. This week alone, she jumped from 800 paid subscribers to about 1,500.",
      "Her scoop is making her rethink the purpose of her work, that now the pressing need is to report deeply on how the country is changing as the result of its new government. She's even thinking of hiring another reporter to help.",
      "\u201cI've gone from very much taking my time, sitting with my thoughts and writing from a personal perspective to being a breaking news reporter,\u201d Kabas said. \u201cThey are very different skills.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The City of New Orleans says it has spent more than 18 months preparing to host its 11th Super Bowl on Feb. 9",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- After a New Year's Day attack struck at the heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super Bowl.",
      "Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season's NFL champion.",
      "Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city's most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are ready to play host.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going above and beyond what we\u2019ve seen in the past when we\u2019ve hosted previously,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. \u201cWe know we\u2019re safer than we\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d",
      "Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about details.",
      "Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city's transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said the Homeland Security Department's Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security.",
      "Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and across the city's historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said.",
      "No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.",
      "Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 400,000 square feet (37,161 square meters) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it\u2019s clear and it\u2019s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,\u201d DeLaune said.",
      "Much of the security infrastructure will carry over to the Mardi Gras season, which has been upgraded to Homeland Security's highest risk rating to receive more manpower and resources.",
      "With the sheer amount of law enforcement on every street corner and security measures in place, \u201cNew Orleans will be the safest place to be anywhere in the country,\u201d said Phillip Constantin, an adviser with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street's vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.",
      "The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said.",
      "Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.",
      "The NFL and federal and city agencies have \u201cput a fresh set of eyes\u201d on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.",
      "\u201cNo specific or credible threats\u201d have surfaced targeting the Super Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an \u201cenhanced security zone\u201d along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen.",
      "After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street zone during the Super Bowl weekend.",
      "But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from bars.",
      "Landry also ordered the removal of multiple homeless encampments near the stadium and funneled dozens of unhoused people into a temporary warehouse shelter.",
      "The Superdome\u2019s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time.",
      "The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.",
      "Dataminr uses generative AI to produce memos alerting Superdome officials of trending patterns, such as an influx of posts showing swelling crowds or other public disturbances as they unfold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThe faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.\u201d",

      "Women represent half of the U.S. population",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Women represent half of the U.S. population but it's still rare for them to have leading roles in setting taxes or budgets in some states.",
      "Take Mississippi, for example. Only one woman currently serves on the 14-member Joint Legislative Budget Committee. The elite group makes the first recommendations on how much money the state should spend on schools, prisons, Medicaid and other programs, giving these lawmakers substantial influence over their colleagues and over the lives of people who use government services.",
      "Second-term Sen. Nicole Akins Boyd was appointed to the committee by Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, a fellow Republican who said he did not consider whether to choose a balance of men and women.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t look at it so much like, \u2018We need a woman here,\u2019 or something like that,\" Hosemann said. \"I look at the abilities and there are plenty of people that have great abilities, male and female. Nicole Boyd, I believe, is outstanding.\u201d",
      "Just over 2,400 women are serving in state legislatures across the U.S., or about 33% of the total, according to the Center for American Women and Politics, at Rutgers University. Almost 1,600 are Democrats, just over 800 are Republicans and the others are nonpartisan or independent.",
      "Last year, when 31% of state lawmakers nationwide were women, they held about 30% of the seats on committees overseeing taxes, revenues and other financial matters, according to a review by The Associated Press.",
      "But participation varies widely by state, and by session. In Utah, women held only 5% of those seats in 2024. This year, they hold 28%. In Nevada, 62% of finance-related seats were held by women when the Legislature last met in 2023.",
      "Jean Sinzdak, associate director of The Center for American Women and Politics, notes that people who serve in legislatures for a long time tend to receive the most desired committee assignments.",
      "\u201cAnything budget- and appropriations-related is always one at the top,\u201d Sinzdak said. \u201cAnd so part of the challenge of getting more women is that women haven\u2019t been serving as long and in the numbers needed.\u201d",
      "Mississippi has the third-lowest percentage of women in its legislature, at 15%, according to the center. The only states behind it are South Carolina, with 13%, and West Virginia, with 11%.",
      "All together, women hold just over 11% of seats on Mississippi\u2019s five money committees: Joint Legislative Budget, House and Senate Appropriations, House Ways and Means and Senate Finance.",
      "Mississippi has never had a woman as governor or House speaker. Only two women have been elected lieutenant governor, decades ago. All of those roles are crucial to setting taxes and budgets.",
      "\u201cLook, I want to see more women there because I think we add to the conversation,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe work together differently, and I think those are all good things for the Legislature.\u201d",
      "For example, women in the Mississippi Legislature banded together in 2023 to secure money for evidence testing in rape cases when a backlog at the state crime lab was delaying trials.",
      "\u201cOur male colleagues supported us just as strongly,\u201d Boyd said.",
      "In West Virginia, Republican Delegate Kathie Hess Crouse said she believes women generally get the committee assignments they ask for. The low number of women on tax and budget committees is not only due to the fact that few serve in the legislature, but also because female lawmakers sometimes prioritize other committees, she said.",
      "That\u2019s the case for Hess Crouse, who chaired the House Committee on Workforce Development and served on other committees focusing on energy, manufacturing and government organization last year. She said legislative leadership has conversations with all the GOP lawmakers before the session starts and asks what their interests are. She always has received her top picks; it just so happens finance is not one of them.",
      "\u201cDo I like money? Yes,\u201d Crouse said. \u201cI do my home budget. I don\u2019t necessarily like it, but I do it. I file my own taxes normally. I work on those things, but it\u2019s not my main interest area. So do I want to serve on finance? No, I have interests elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The balance is different in Nevada, which in 2019 became the first state where a majority of legislators were women.",
      "That is reflected on key committees. Women have most of the seats on the Assembly\u2019s Revenue and Ways and Means committees. And they hold seven of eight seats on the Senate\u2019s finance committee, including the entire Democratic delegation on the committee.",
      "The chair, Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop, said there could be areas, such as breast cancer funding, where female lawmakers might be more likely to put taxpayer money because of their personal connections to the issue. But she said she doesn\u2019t approach her work thinking about gender.",
      "\u201cWhenever I vote and my other colleagues vote,\u201d Dondero Loop said, \u201cwe do it solely as being a Nevadan and making things better.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Steiner served as co-chair of the Oregon Legislature\u2019s Ways and Means Committee, which handles money matters and has members from the House and Senate, before being elected state treasurer last year. She said it's important for women's personal and professional life experiences to be brought into state decision-making.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t include 50% of the population, the perspective of 50% of the population in your decision-making, then you\u2019re really disadvantaging everybody: men and women, and certainly children,\u201d said Steiner, a Democrat.",
      "Other states also have women in prominent roles. In Alaska, a Republican woman was one of three co-chairs of the House Finance Committee last year. Connecticut has two Democratic women leading the Appropriations Committee and another co-chairing the Finance Committee. Vermont had two Democratic women in charge of the Appropriations committees for 2023-24.",
      "South Carolina has never had a woman chair a money committee. Three served on the 25-person House Ways and Means Committee in 2024. A Republican woman was rising in the 23-member Senate Finance Committee, but she took a stand against a total abortion ban and lost her primary along with the only two other Republican women in the South Carolina Senate.",

The $27 million price tag includes 100 acres (40 hectares) of prime property along the Oklahoma River in a growing city of roughly 700,000 residents, where a state-of-the-art NBA arena is set to break ground and a developer is pushing plans for the country's tallest skyscraper.",
      "Although the stockyard's owners are hopeful a buyer will keep the cattle coming, they acknowledge the land is attractive for redevelopment.",
      "The sale is a sign of the times for livestock auctions and America's cattle market, a volatile industry squeezed in recent years by drought, higher production costs and the lowest number of cattle in the U.S. since the 1950s.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on imported goods has created uncertainty in the industry, although the potential impact is not yet clear. The U.S. is the world's largest producer of beef but is still a net beef importer, with Canada and Mexico among the top countries accounting for U.S. beef imports.",
      "The number of cattle moving through the maze of wooden pens in Oklahoma City is down roughly 20% over the past two years, said Jerry Reynolds, the stockyard's president.",
      "The same family has owned the grounds since 1910, but Reynolds said younger generations of the owners are simply not interested in overseeing a major stockyard and the daily grind that entails: a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation with tens of thousands of animals auctioned every week and a seemingly endless maintenance to-do list.",
      "\u201cThe handwriting has kind of been on the wall for a long time, as the cities grow and surround these facilities,\u201d said Derrell Peel, a professor at Oklahoma State University who studies cattle markets. \u201cNot only is that a prime piece of real estate, but the increasing challenges, the environmental challenges, of operating a stockyard in a major city, is pretty tricky.\u201d",
      "The stockyard went on the market in October and the current owners do not have a timetable for completing the sale.",
      "As many as 10,000 head of cattle still rumble each week through the stockyard, an urban survivor in an industry that is largely now scattered across rural America. One of the largest stocker/feeder cattle markets in the world, the Oklahoma City grounds are the last of the so-called \u201cterminal markets\u201d that dotted the Midwest, where cattle were shipped, sold, slaughtered and then processed at nearby packing houses.",
      "In the mid-20th century, such stockyards thrived in bigger cities including Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska, and Fort Worth, Texas. But with the advent of refrigeration and the increasing value of those properties in urban centers, they slowly transitioned to more rural areas closer to feedlots and meatpacking plants, according to Peel, a professor of agricultural economics.",
      "If Oklahoma City's stockyard is shuttered, an auction market in Joplin, Missouri, would likely claim the title of the largest in the country, Peel said. That stockyard, a little more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Oklahoma City, as well as another large facility just west of the metro in El Reno, Oklahoma, would pick up much of the business, he said.",
      "\u201cAs a member of the family that began the yards and has been involved throughout our entire 115-year history, obviously I have some feelings about the outcome there,\" said Chris Bakwin, chairman of the stockyard's board and one of the major shareholders in the company founded by his great-grandfather. \u201cBut I have to do what\u2019s best for shareholders.\u201d",
      "The stockyard's pens are set up on the original bricks laid during its construction more than a century ago. From a metal catwalk that runs over the stockyard, visitors can hear the thundering sound of hoofs and the yells of cowboys on horseback leading them into pens or running a few at a time into a small, tightly packed arena where buyers signal their interest to a fast-talking auctioneer.",
      "On a recent January morning, rancher Garrison Duke, his wife Pamela, and their children, Pecos, 3, and 1-year-old Sterling, hauled a trailer full of cattle from their ranch in Lexington, on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.",
      "Duke was a boy when he first started going to the stockyard with his father and, on a good trip, they would leave town with a full stomach after a steak dinner and perhaps a new pair of boots.",
      "\u201cIt was just always a thrill, getting to see all the cattle and how they all handled them, seeing them sell and my dad get a big paycheck at the end of the year. It was good for everybody,\" Duke said. \u201cNow we're trying to keep the kids a part of it all.\"",
      "Adjacent to the stockyard is a business district filled with shops boasting western charm: Shorty's Hattery, National Saddlery, western wear stores and popular steakhouses. The area has become a tourist destination for travelers seeking a bit of Americana in the U.S. heartland.",
      "Oklahoma City's population grew by 3% over the past few years, according to the Census Bureau, making it the nation's 20th largest city.",
      "And while other stockyards in major cities have gone away, largely because of the increasing value of urban land, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said he believes the stockyard can coexist in the center of a booming city.",
      "\u201cI do, probably for no other reason but that Oklahoma City is so geographically large,\" Holt said. \u201cIt's not like the stockyards is in midtown Manhattan.\u201d",
      "Still, there is some fear among those who make their living at the stockyard that a buyer could have a different vision in mind.",
      "\u201cThere definitely is,\u201d said Jason Baker, who owns one of the nine commission firms that buy and sell cattle at the stockyard. \u201cIt's very vital for my family. It's our livelihood.\""

      "As crews work to clean up from the Los Angeles wildfires, city officials and residents are opposing the designation of a federally owned park to process hazardous waste",
      "DUARTE, Calif. -- Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San Gabriel Valley, she said.",
      "Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires, she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the community and also the school districts here, where we have children,\u201d said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23 years and former local school board member.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous materials,\" she said. \"Parents are absolutely concerned.\"",
      "Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities opposing the Environmental Protection Agency's use of Lario Park in Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire.",
      "In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater.",
      "The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints, pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when burned.",
      "\u201cThe removal of these materials should not come at the cost of creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately impacted by pollution,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said in a statement.",
      "The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.",
      "Experts acknowledge residents' concerns, but say hazardous waste is not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the waste is not stored on site for years.",
      "At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was the site chosen? Why weren't we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic waste 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the burn zone and risk contaminating our communities? What testing will be done after it's closed?",
      "Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and spilled into the hall. They shouted \u201cShut it down!\u201d and chanted \u201cLeave it in Altadena!\u201d",
      "EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations, including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was available.",
      "She emphasized the EPA has done this work for years across the state.",
      "\u201cWe did the exact same thing\" for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa fires, Fitzgerald said, and \"we did not have any impacts to the community during the entire process.\"",
      "But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire.",
      "The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily.",
      "The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA\u2019s Celeste McCoy told the county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less than six months, and more areas are being considered.",
      "With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and soil.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through, and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,\u201d Mohanty said. \"And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into the soil in a short time. \"",
      "The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated.",
      "Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal officials.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have confidence when they\u2019ve really done this behind our backs,\" she said.",
      "While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and Environmental Health.",
      "\u201cThe community has the right to know that information from the EPA and the Army Corps,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable for ensuring safety.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we don\u2019t want it here, and we\u2019re going to continue to fight to not have it here,\u201d she said of the site. \u201cBut the fact is, it\u2019s here right now. And so we have to just acknowledge the safety of our students, the concerns of our families.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- From an ice cream parlor in California to a medical supply business in North Carolina to a T-shirt vendor outside Detroit, U.S. businesses are bracing to take a hit from the taxes President Donald Trump imposed Saturday on imports from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 America\u2019s three biggest trading partners.",
      "The levies \u2014 25% on Canadian and Mexican and 10% on Chinese goods \u2013 will take effect Tuesday. Canadian energy, including oil, natural gas and electricity, will be taxed at a lower 10% rate.",
      "Mexico\u2019s president immediately ordered retaliatory tariffs and Canada\u2019s prime minister said the country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in U.S. imports. China did not immediately respond to Trump\u2019s action.",
      "The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that Trump's tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 to $1,200 in annual purchasing power.",
      "Gregory Daco, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm EY, calculates that the tariffs would increase inflation, which was running at a 2.9% annual rate in December, by 0.4 percentage points this year. Daco also projects that the U.S. economy, which grew 2.8% last year, would fall by 1.5% this year and 2.1% in 2026 \u201cas higher import costs dampen consumer spending and business investment.\u2019\u2019",
      "The Penny Ice Creamery in Santa Cruz, California, has had to hike prices of its ice cream \u2014 including popular flavors \u201cstrawberry pink peppercorn\u2019\u2019 and \u201cchocolate caramel sea salt\u2019\u2019 \u2014 repeatedly in recent years as an inflationary surge increased the cost of its supplies.",
      "\u201cI feel bad about always having to raise prices,\u2019\u2019 said co-owner Zach Davis. \u201cWe were looking forward to inflation coming down, the economy stabilizing in 2025 ... Now with the tariffs, we may be back at it again.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump tariffs, Davis said, threaten to drive up the cost of the mostly made-in-China refrigerators, freezers and blenders he\u2019ll need if Penny Ice Creamery goes ahead with plans to add to its six shops. He still has painful memories of the extra equipment costs the company had to absorb when Trump slapped massive tariffs on China during his first term.",
      "The new tariffs will also raise the price of a customer favorite \u2014 sprinkles \u2014 which Penny Ice Creamery imports from a company in Whitby, Ontario. Tacking a 25% import tax on even something as small as that can damage a small business like his.",
      "\u201cThe margins are so slim,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBeing able to offer that add-on can maybe generate an additional 10 cents in profit per scoop. If a tariff wipes that out, that can really be the difference between being profitable and being break-even and even being underwater by the end of the year.\u2019\u2019",
      "In Asheville, North Carolina, Casey Hite, CEO of Aeroflow Health, expects to take a hit because his company gets more than half its supplies \u2014 including breast pumps \u2014 from Chinese manufacturers, providing them to American patients through insurance plans. Aeroflow Health gets paid by insurers at pre-negotiated rates, put in place before Trump decided on his tariffs.",
      "Hite said the tax on Chinese imports would hit the company\u2019s finances, forcing it either to purchase cheaper and lower-quality products or pass higher costs along via higher health insurance premiums. Those might take two years to materialize, Hite said, but eventually they would hit consumers\u2019 budgets.",
      "\u201cIt will impact the patients,\u201d Hite said. \u201cIn time, patients pay more for the products.\u201d",
      "Even the made-in-USA absorbent incontinence pads Aeroflow Health buys aren\u2019t safe from Trump\u2019s import taxes. They may include pulp from tariff target Canada and plastics and packaging from China, according to the Aeroflow Health, which warns of \u201cturbulences\u201d from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cIs this going to affect our business? You bet it is,\u2019\u2019 said Linda Schlesinger-Wagner, who owns skinnytees, a women\u2019s apparel company in Birmingham, Michigan, north of Detroit, that imports clothing from China. She said the 10% tax would increase her costs, though she plans to absorb the extra expense instead of passing it along to customers.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u2019 she said, referring to the broader impact of the tariffs. \u201cAnd I think people are going to be truly shocked at the pricing they\u2019re going to see on the cars, on the lumber, on the clothes, on the food. This is going to be a mess.\u2019\u2019",
      "William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that many companies that stocked up on imported goods ahead of time to avoid the tariffs. They will be able to draw on their piled-up inventories for weeks or a couple of months, delaying their customers\u2019 pain.",
      "George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, an industry advocacy group, said construction companies have been hoarding materials in anticipation of Trump\u2019s actions, but he worries about the possibility of inflation spiking in three to six months.",
      "\u201cOnce that inventory starts to get low, we\u2019re going to start feeling the effects,\u201d Carillo said in a phone interview Saturday, ahead of the announcement. \u201cDevelopers and general contractors need to keep up with the pace and they\u2019re going to start buying more products and it\u2019s going to be at a higher price point.\u201d",
      "All that will be exacerbated by an emerging immigration crackdown that is already spooking the construction industry\u2019s labor pool, he said.",
      "\u201cYou put tariffs and you put workforce instability, it\u2019s going to create major delays in projects. It\u2019s going to create an increase in prices because of the lack of availability,\u201d Carrillo said.",
      "Then there are the industries that don't have the luxury of stockpiling, including supermarkets whose farm products will spoil. So the tariff impact will show up on grocery shelves within days.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t stockpile avocados,\u2019\u2019 Reinsch said. \u201cYou don\u2019t stockpile cut flowers. You don\u2019t stockpile bananas.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the tomato trading hub of Nogales, Arizona, produce vendor Rod Sbragia, who followed his father into the business nearly four decades ago, worries that the import levies will force some distribution companies out of business and \u201cwould be detrimental to the American consumer, to the choices they have at the supermarket.\u201d",
      "Sbragia voted for Trump in the past three elections and calls himself a \u201cstaunch Republican.\u201d The president, he said, must not have been properly advised on the matter.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re worried about cost to consumers, inflationary pressures and the overall health of our population,\u2019\u2019 he asked, \u201cwhy are we going to make it more difficult to get access to fresh fruits and vegetables?\u201d",
      "American farmers are also likely to get caught in Trump\u2019s trade tussle with Canada, China and Mexico. The president\u2019s supporters in rural America make a tempting target for retaliatory tariffs. That is what happened in Trump\u2019s first term when other countries, notably China, slapped back against the president\u2019s tariffs with levies of their own on things like soybeans and pork. In response, Trump spent billions in taxpayer money to compensate them for lost sales and lower prices.",
      "Many farmers are now counting on the president to come through and protect them from reprisals.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration provided a safety net,\u201d said former tobacco grower Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a collection of 700 farms that lawfully brings in foreign temporary laborers to work the fields through a federal visa program. Many of the association's farmers \u201ctrust him that he\u2019s going to take care of anybody who\u2019s hurt by the tariffs, and that\u2019s really all that we can ask for.\u201d",

      "Ex-Officer Derek Chauvin allegedly pinned Patty Day with his knee in 2020.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle a lawsuit by a woman who alleged that ex-Officer Derek Chauvin hauled her from her minivan and pinned her to the ground with his knee in January 2020, just as he did four months later when he killed George Floyd.",
      "Patty Day, formerly employed by the Public Works Department, claimed in a lawsuit filed last May that she was the victim of excessive force and a wrongful arrest. She acknowledged that she was drunk on the evening of Jan. 17, 2020, and depressed over her impending divorce and other difficulties when she got stuck in the snow for several hours.",
      "Chauvin and his partner that night, Officer Ellen Jensen, eventually arrived on the scene. The lawsuit alleged that the officers \u201cviolently yanked\u201d Day from her vehicle and threw her to the pavement, causing several injuries.",
      "\u201cChauvin then assumed his signature pose, pressing his knee into the subdued and handcuffed Patty\u2019s back \u2014 just as he would later do to snuff the life out of George Floyd \u2014 and remaining that way well after Patty was controlled,\u201d the complaint alleged. A drunken driving charge was later dropped after a judge ruled that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest her and suppressed the blood alcohol test evidence.",
      "The Minneapolis City Council unanimously approved the $600,000 settlement Thursday. Council member LaTrisha Vetaw told her colleagues that $175,000 will go to Day while her attorneys will get $425,000.",
      "The city has now paid over $36 million to settle police misconduct cases involving Chauvin, including $27 million to the Floyd family.",
      "\u201cWhile no settlement can undo what Patty endured, we are grateful to have reached an agreement that holds the officers accountable for their actions,\u201d Day's attorney, Katie Bennett, said in a statement. \u201cThis case is yet another example of the critical need for justice and reform in policing.\u201d",
      "Chauvin, who is white, remains incarcerated at a federal prison in Texas for his conviction in state court of murdering Floyd and a federal conviction for violating Floyd's civil rights. The Black man's murder sparked a national reckoning with racial injustice."

      "The watchdog for U.S. assistance to Afghanistan said the Taliban have no legal right to billions of dollars in funding set aside for the country because they are not recognized as its government and are under sanctions.",
      "In its latest report issued Friday, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction also said President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and Congress may want to examine returning nearly $4 billion earmarked for Afghanistan to the \u201ccustody and control\u201d of the U.S. government.",
      "In 2022, the U.S. transferred $3.5 billion in Afghan central bank assets previously frozen in America to the Swiss-based Fund for the Afghan People. The fund has grown to nearly $4 billion since then, according to the inspector general.",
      "Although no payments benefitting Afghans have been made, the fund is aimed at protecting and stabilizing the economy on their behalf.",
      "\u201cThe Taliban want these funds even though they have no legal right to them since they are not recognized by the United States as the government of Afghanistan, are on the U.S. Specially Designated Global Terrorist list, and are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions,\u201d the report said.",
      "The report follows Trump\u2019s decision to freeze foreign aid for 90 days pending reviews to determine whether they align with his policy goals.",
      "According to the report, the U.S. has spent nearly $3.71 billion in Afghanistan since withdrawing from the country in 2021. Most of that has gone to U.N. agencies.",
      "Another $1.2 billion remains available in the pipeline for possible disbursement, the report said.",
      "U.S. humanitarian assistance may have \u201cstaved off famine\u201d in the face of economic collapse, but it has not dissuaded the Taliban from taking Americans hostage, dismantling the rights of women and girls, censoring the media, allowing the country to become a \u201cterrorist safe haven,\u201d and targeting former Afghan government officials, added the watchdog.",
      "The U.S. remains the largest donor to Afghanistan, but the report said a lot of the money is taxed or diverted.",
      "\u201cThe further the cash gets away from the source, the less transparency there is,\u201d Chris Borgeson, the deputy inspector general for audits and inspections at the watchdog, told The Associated Press last August."

      "Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, which operated the Learjet 55, said in a statement: \u201cWe cannot confirm any survivors.\u201d There was no immediate word whether anyone on the ground was killed, but at least six people were treated for injuries at a hospital.",
      "Everyone aboard the flight was from Mexico. The child was being transported home, according to Jet Rescue spokesperson Shai Gold. The flight\u2019s final destination was Tijuana after a stop in Missouri.",
      "The patient and her mother were on board along with four crew members. Gold said this was a seasoned crew and everyone involved in these flights goes through rigorous training.",
      "\u201cWhen an incident like this happens, it\u2019s shocking and surprising,\u201d Gold told The Associated Press. \u201cAll of the aircraft are maintained, not a penny is spared because we know our mission is so critical.\u201d",

      "The plane was registered in Mexico. Jet Rescue is based in Mexico and has operations both there and in the U.S.",

      "The Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for Jet Rescue. In 2023 five crewmembers were killed when their plane overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed into a hillside.",
      "In Philadelphia, a doorbell camera captured video of the plane plunging in a streak of white and exploding as it hit the ground near a shopping mall and major roadway.",

      "The Learjet 55 quickly disappeared from radar after taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and climbing to an altitude of 1,600 feet (487 meters). It was registered to a company operating as Med Jets, according to the flight tracking website Flight Aware.",
      "Shortly after 6 p.m., audio recorded by LiveATC captured an air traffic controller telling \u201cMedevac Medservice 056\u201d to turn right when departing. About 30 seconds later it repeats the request before asking, \u201cYou on frequency?\u201d Minutes later, the controller says, \u201cWe have a lost aircraft. We\u2019re not exactly sure what happened, so we\u2019re trying to figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.\u201d",
      "In a post on the social media platform Truth Social, President Donald Trump said: \u201cSo sad to see the plane go down in Philadelphia.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore innocent souls lost,\u201d he added. \u201cOur people are totally engaged.\u201d",
      "A continuous stream of police vehicles and fire trucks initially responded at the crash site, taking over business parking lots. Within about an hour, the cry of sirens and shouted orders had faded into relative quiet at the edges of the closed-off area, and darkness settled in as drivers passing by peered out trying to see what was happening.",
      "The plane crashed in a busy intersection near Roosevelt Mall, an outdoor shopping center in the densely populated neighborhood of Rhawnhurst.",
      "One cellphone video taken by a witness moments after the crash showed a chaotic scene with debris scattered across the intersection. A wall of orange glowed just beyond as a plume of black smoke rose into the sky and sirens blared.",
      "Michael Schiavone, 37, was sitting at his home in Mayfair, a nearby neighborhood, when he heard a loud bang and his house shook. He said it felt like a mini earthquake and when he checked his home security camera, it looked like a missile came down.",

    "story": [
      "Groundhog Day predictions about the coming of spring put the spotlight on Punxsutawney Phil every Feb. 2",
      "Groundhog Day predictions about the coming of spring put the spotlight on Punxsutawney Phil every Feb. 2, but celebrating the midpoint between the shortest and darkest day of the year and the spring equinox has ancient roots in European agricultural life.",
      "Punxsutawney Phil is far from the only groundhog whose human handlers make annual announcements about whether they've seen their own shadows and are predicting six more weeks of winter or an early spring.",
      "The date not only divides the calendar between the winter solstice and the spring equinox \u2014 it's also a time of year that figures in the Celtic calendar and the Christian holiday of Candlemas.",
      "And in eastern and central Pennsylvania, where people of German descent have been watching the groundhog's annual emergence from hibernation for centuries, there's a tradition of groundhog clubs and celebrations that are independent of Phil.",
      "Some dismiss the Punxsutawney event as an unworthy rival to their own festivities, which they say forecast more accurate weather predictions. There have been weather-predicting groundhogs in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and less formal celebrations far and wide.",
      "One thing it's not: serious business.",
      "\u201cWe know this is silly; we know this is fun,\u201d said Marcy Galando, executive director of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. \u201cWe want people to come here with a sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Here are some things to know about the holiday:",
      "Celtic people across Europe marked the four days that are midway between the winter solstice, the spring equinox, the summer solstice and the fall equinox. What the Celts called Imbolc is also around when Christians celebrate Candlemas, timed to Joseph and Mary's presentation of Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem.",
      "Ancient people would watch the sun, stars and animal behavior to guide farming practices and other decisions, and the practice of watching an animal\u2019s emergence from winter hibernation to forecast weather has roots in a similar German tradition involving badgers or bears. Pennsylvania Germans apparently substituted the groundhog, endemic to the eastern and midwestern United States.",
      "Historians have found a reference in an 1841 diary to groundhog weather forecasts in early February among families of German descent in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, according to the late Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor whose 2003 book about Groundhog Day explored the Celtic connection.",
      "Yoder concluded the festival has roots in \u201cancient, undoubtedly prehistoric, weather lore.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Germans settled in the area, and in the late 1880s, they started celebrating the holiday by picnicking, hunting and eating groundhogs.",
      "Members of Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, organized in 1899, care for Phil and his woodchuck family at a customized space beside Punxsutawney Memorial Library, where there's a window with a view into the creature's burrow.",
      "The Punxsutawney groundhog makes predictions, but he's not always predictable. The designated groundhog emerged before sunrise in 1929 and didn't come out until late afternoon in 1941.",
      "The 1993 Bill Murray movie \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d caused such a resurgence of interest that two years after it came out, event organizers voiced concern about rowdy crowds drinking all night, people climbing trees and others stripping to their underwear. In 1998, a groundhog club leader wearing a $4,000 groundhog suit reported being assaulted by a half-dozen young men.",
      "Alcohol is now prohibited at Gobbler's Knob, Phil's spot some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.",
      "The early festivities in Punxsutawney were followed in 1907 by folks in Quarryville, a farming area in Lancaster County in Pennsylvania's southeastern corner. The roughly 240 members of the Slumbering Groundhog Lodge there report the winter forecast from Octoraro Orphie, or least via his well-preserved remains.",
      "The groundhog is a member of the squirrel family and related to chipmunks and prairie dogs. It's also known as a woodchuck, a whistle pig \u2014 or in the parlance of Pennsylvania Dutch, a language with German roots, a \u201cgrundsau.\u201d",
      "Groundhogs are herbivores that are themselves edible to humans, although they are not widely consumed. Their lifespan in the wild is typically two or three years.",
      "Some cooks advise groundhogs are best taken when they are young and after clover is in bloom, since a clover diet is thought to improve the meat's taste.",
      "Starting in the 1930s, groundhog lodges opened in eastern Pennsylvania. They were social clubs with similarities to Freemasonry.",
      "Intended to preserve Pennsylvania German culture and traditions, clubs would sometimes fine those who were caught speaking anything but their Pennsylvania Dutch language at meetings. They were traditionally all-male groups and several of the clubs remain active.",
      "They all share the unifying feature of a groundhog's weather prognostication, according to William W. Donner, a Kutztown University anthropology professor and author of \u201cSerious Nonsense,\u201d a book about the lodges and other efforts to preserve German heritage.",
      "\u201cI think it's just one of these traditional rituals that people enjoy participating in, that maybe take them away from modern life for 15 minutes,\u201d Donner said.",
      "Some well-meaning efforts have sought to determine Phil's accuracy, but what \u201csix weeks of winter\u201d means is debatable. Claims that a groundhog has or has not seen its shadow \u2014 and that it's able to communicate that to a human \u2014 are also fair territory for skeptics and the humor impaired.",
      "By all accounts, Phil predicts more winter far more often than he predicts an early spring.",
      "Groundhogs are mostly solitary creatures who start to emerge in midwinter to find a mate. The science behind whether they can make any accurate weather predictions is problematic at best.",
      "Among the skeptics is the National Centers for Environmental Information, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The government agency compares Phil's record with U.S. national temperatures to conclude he's hardly perfect."

      "Democrats are poised to elect a new leader in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party\u2019s future",
      "OXON HILL, Md. -- Democrats, desperately seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party's future.",
      "More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison is not seeking reelection.",
      "Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong.",
      "Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading candidates are talking tough.",
      "\u201cAs we reel with shock at the horror that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who\u2019s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman and a top candidate for DNC chair.",
      "The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand.",
      "Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.",
      "The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin's Wikler and Minnesota\u2019s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They're promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party's anti-Trump rapid response system.",
      "They have promised not to shy away from the party's dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011.",
      "Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author; former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O\u2019Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders\u2019 last presidential campaign.",
      "Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC.",
      "But he has struggled to gain traction.",
      "Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food.",
      "Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections.",
      "Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party.",
      "\u201cAs positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I\u2019m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, \u2018We\u2019re in real trouble because I don\u2019t see a desire to change,\u2019\u201d said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair.",

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services includes the names of doctors who have had their licenses revoked, suspended or faced other discipline, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The letter was meant to lend credibility to Kennedy\u2019s nomination, which has faced strenuous opposition from medical experts due to his two decades of anti-vaccine activism. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor who boasts on his official website of an effort he created to vaccinate 36,000 children against hepatitis B, expressed hesitancy about Kennedy's nomination and is seen as a key vote.",
      "The AP found that in addition to the physicians who had faced disciplinary action, many of the nearly 800 signers are not doctors. The letter with the names of those who signed was provided to the AP by Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s office after he entered it into the Congressional Record on Wednesday during the first of Kennedy\u2019s two confirmation hearings.",
      "Among those who signed it were a self-described journalist, a certified public accountant, a firefighter/paramedic, a certified health coach and someone who said they had a bachelor\u2019s degree \u201cwith an emphasis on Jungian Psychology.\u201d The signers include at least 75 nurses, as well as physician's assistants. More than 90 did not include any credentials at all.",
      "Over 20 were chiropractors, representing an industry that has funded Kennedy's work. An AP investigation found that donations from a chiropractic group represented one-sixth of the revenues collected by Kennedy's anti-vaccine nonprofit in 2019.",
      "The letter was organized and submitted by MAHA Action, which is run by Del Bigtree, who worked for Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign and is a longtime anti-vaccine activist. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Kennedy transferred the trademark for the \u201cMAHA\u201d slogan to an limited liability company run by Bigtree. Kennedy reported that he received $100,000 in income from licensing the slogan and said in his financial disclosures that he had transferred the trademark for \u201cno compensation.\u201d",
      "MAHA stands for \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d a play on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again.\"",
      "Emma Post, a MAHA Action spokesperson, said in an email that the letter was \u201cshared and circulated organically in a grassroots manner with explicit instructions that it was for physicians only to sign on to.\u201d She did not address the AP\u2019s questions about what further steps the group took to verify credentials, if any.",
      "Bigtree and Kennedy did not return messages seeking comment. A White House spokesman, Kush Desai, said the administration looks forward to the Senate's swift confirmation of Kennedy.",
      "The letter includes the header \u201c Doctors for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u201d and begins with the words, \u201cWe, the undersigned physicians.\" It says lower down that it \u201creflects the collective voice of physicians and medical professionals\u201d committed to addressing chronic disease.",
      "The AP\u2019s review found that at least 10 doctors who signed the letter had run into trouble with state medical boards or their board certification body for a variety of alleged misconduct. Sanctions they faced included having their license revoked or suspended, being put on probation, receiving a reprimand or other action. One received a warning letter from the Federal Trade Commission, which said he was unlawfully advertising products as treatments or prevention for COVID-19, including intravenous nutrient therapy and vitamins.",
      "Among the signers was Paul Thomas, an anti-vaccine doctor who voluntarily surrendered his medical license in 2022 after Oregon's medical board found he had engaged in repeated and gross negligence in the practice of medicine.",
      "Thomas did not admit or deny the finding. NBC News reported that Thomas was part of a team assembled by Kennedy who remotely advised an anti-vaccine activist in Samoa during a measles outbreak there on how to treat children with vitamins. A person who responded on behalf of Thomas, DeeDee Hoover, said the information the AP had was inaccurate but did not reply when asked what specifically was wrong.",
      "Other signers included Dr. Simone Gold, who was reprimanded by California\u2019s medical board after she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her conduct at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Gold was recently pardoned by Trump and told the AP in an email that her reprimand and other disciplinary action were overturned by a judge prior to her pardon.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is an honorable and honest person with vast subject matter knowledge and experience who values the health of the American people, and furthermore because he is willing to challenge corporate interests where they conflict with the best interests of those citizens,\u201d Gold wrote in an email.",
      "Meryl Nass, whose medical license was suspended in Maine over her treatment of COVID-19 patients, also signed. She told the AP she is appealing the decision and expects to be fully vindicated.",
      "At least two of the doctors were disciplined, prior to the pandemic, for improperly giving out vaccine waivers, including one who had his license revoked and another who was put on probation. Another doctor's license was revoked for refusing to follow COVID-19 guidelines.",
      "Post said MAHA Action\u2019s letter was just one of several provided to the Senate supporting Kennedy, including one that she provided a link to that she said was signed by \u201c17,000 medical professionals.\u201d That letter stated it was from international medical providers and did not include the names of those who signed.",
      "Opponents of Kennedy's nomination sent their own letter with signatures from what they said were more than 18,000 \u201cvetted and verified\u201d doctors. The group, the Committee to Protect Health Care, said that the letter was initially circulated among verified physicians and that as additional signatures were added, their credentials were checked. The group provided the list of signatories to the AP but with anonymized names that included the first initial of their first name along with the first three letters of their last name, as well as their medical credentials. They said doctors' names were anonymized for their privacy and to protect them from harassment.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 23:13:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump claims more taxes on trade wouldn't be a cost to the US - but almost all economists dispute this.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "The US president signed an executive order putting a 25% tariff - or tax on imports - on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, to get both countries to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "Goods coming from China will also be hit with a 10% tariff \"above any additional tariffs\" until it cuts fentanyl smuggling. He has already pledged to target the country with a 60% rate, and has mulled a 200% tax on some car imports.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "During his election campaign, he told voters that the taxes were \"not going to be a cost to you, it\u2019s a cost to another country\".",
      "That was almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.",
      "Trudeau urges buyers to 'choose Canadian' as Trump tariff dispute intensifies",
      "China, Canada and Mexico vow swift response to Trump tariffs",
      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",
      "And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.",
      "The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.",
      "If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.",
      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",
      "In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.",
      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",
      "Raising prices",
      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, has kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It has also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

      "Donald Trump's talk of applying new tariffs to goods from America's biggest trade partners has sparked months of uncertainty for business owners.",
      "On Saturday, the president made good on his threats, ordering a new 25% tax on shipments from Mexico and Canada and raising existing tariffs on goods from China by 10%.",
      "But that has not stopped the questions.",
      "\"Is it for a day, is it a political flex or is it something that will last for four years?\" asked Nicolas Palazzi, the founder of Brooklyn-based PM Spirits. He runs a 21-person business that imports and sells wine and spirits, about 20% of which come from Mexico.",
      "Trump's orders set in motion threats that the president has discussed for months, striking at shipments from America's top three trade partners, which together account for more than 40% of the roughly $3tn goods the US imports each year.",
      "Canadian oil and other \"energy resources\" will face a lower 10% rate. But otherwise, there will be no exceptions, the White House said.",
      "Trump said the tariffs were intended to hold Canada and Mexico accountable for promises to address illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "The measures go into effect on 4 February and are to remain in place \"until the crisis is alleviated,\" according to the orders.",
      "If the plans were not a surprise, they still presented a potentially stunning blow to many businesses, especially for those in North America. The three countries have become tightly linked economically after decades of free trade under a treaty signed in the 1990s, known then as Nafta and updated and renamed under the Trump administration to USMCA.",
      "The growth of mezcal in the US, brought in by businesses like Palazzi's, has been part of this shift.",
      "Since 2003, consumption of tequila and mezcal has roughly tripled, increasing at a rate of more than 7% each year, according to Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group.",
      "Overall since the 1990s, trade in spirits between the US and Mexico has surged by more than 4,000% percent, said the organisation, which issued a statement after the president's announcement warning that the tariffs would \"significantly harm all three countries\".",
      "For months, Palazzi has been fielding nervous questions from his suppliers in Mexico, who are typically small, family owned businesses and may not survive if the tariffs are prolonged.",
      "If it sticks, he said the 25% tax on the bottles of mezcal, tequila and rum he brings in will push up prices - and sales will drop.",
      "\"Definitely this is going to impact the business negatively. But can you really plan? No,\" he said. \"Our strategy is roll-with-the-punches, wait and see and adapt to whatever craziness is going to unfold.\"",
      "Economists say the hit from the tariffs could push the economies of Mexico and Canada into recession.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses, described the looming tariffs from the US, and expected retaliation, as \"existential\" for many of his members.",
      "\"Look, we get that the government has got to respond in some fashion \u2026. But at the same time we urge the government to use caution,\" he said, comparing tariffs on imports to chemotherapy: \"It poisons your own people in order to try and fight the disease.\"",
      "\"It's going to have an effect everywhere,\" said Sophie Avernin, director of De Grandes Vi\u00f1edos de Francia in Mexico, noting that many Americans own Mexican alcohol brands and Modelo beer is actually owned by a Belgian company.",
      "Trump, who has embraced tariffs as a tool to address issues far removed from trade, has dismissed concerns about any collateral damage to the economy in the US.",
      "But analysts have warned the measures will weigh on growth, raise prices and cost the economy jobs - roughly 286,000, according to estimates by the Tax Foundation, not including retaliation.",
      "Those in the alcohol business said the industry had already been struggling to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic and its after-shocks, including inflation, which has prompted many Americans to cut back on dining out and drinking.",
      "Smaller firms, who typically have less financial cushion and ability to swallow a sudden 25% jump in cost, will bear the brunt of the disruption.",
      "\"I'm pretty frustrated,\" said California-based importer Ben Scott, whose nine-person business Pueblo de Sabor brings in brands from Mexico such as Mal Bien and Lalocura.",
      "\"There's just a huge cost that's going to affect so many people in ways other than they're paying a couple bucks more for a cocktail, which doesn't sound like a tragedy.\"",
      "Fred Sanchez has spent years pushing to expand his business, Bad Hombre Importing, a small California-based importer and distributor of Mexican agave-based spirits like Agua del Sol, and was recently working on deals in New York and Illinois.",
      "But his potential partners started hesitating as Trump's tariff talk ramped up last year.",
      "Now, instead of expanding, he is contemplating selling off his stock of liquor and possibly shutting down. He said he had little capacity to absorb the jump in costs and saw little scope for raising prices in the current economy.",
      "\"25% is just not something that we can realistically pass onto the consumer,\" he said.",
      "Sanchez said he believed that Trump might be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and the tax could be short-lived. Still, for his business, damage is already done."

      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "title": "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

      "Sales of Apple iPhones dropped at the end of last year, as the tech firm's roll out of new artificial intelligence (AI) features was met with a lukewarm response.",
      "Chief executive Tim Cook said the new features helped to drive stronger sales in the countries where they were available, such as the US.",
      "But iPhone sales slipped about 1% overall compared with last year, to $69.1bn (\u00a355bn).",
      "The company is also contending with other challenges, including a sales drop in China and the possibility its US sales will be hit by tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.",
      "He has called for tariffs of up to 60% on products made in China, where Apple does much of its manufacturing.",
      "But the timing and full scope of those plans, which would put a new tax on imports into the US, remains highly uncertain.",
      "Mr Cook told investors on Thursday the company was monitoring the situation.",
      "Apple has been gradually introducing AI features to its products, starting last year in the US.",
      "Investors have been hoping this will re-ignite sales, which have slowed as customers hold onto their phones and other products for longer.",
      "Mr Cook said Apple was expecting to push out the AI features to more languages in April.",
      "However, the features have not been without controversy. The AI's news roundup alerts came under fire earlier this month for making repeated mistakes in their summaries of news headlines - including ones from the BBC.",
      "The feature was eventually suspended following over a week of criticism.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr Cook said on Thursday Apple had seen a record number of purchases of new iPhones from people who already own older iPhones.",

It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

    "summary": "The commodities giant went on trial in Switzerland over attempts to gain access to Angola's oil market.",
    "story": [
      "Switzerland's highest court has convicted the commodities trading giant Trafigura and one of its senior executives of bribery over payments made by the firm to gain access to Angola's lucrative oil market.",
      "In a landmark case, the court handed the company's British former chief operating officer Mike Wainwright, who has also competed as a racing driver, a 32-month jail sentence and fined the company $148m (\u00a3119m).",
      "This is the first time an entire company has been charged by Switzerland's highest court, and bribery convictions of senior staff are rare.",
      "Trafigura's lawyers said the company and Wainwright intended to appeal against the verdict, so the former executive was not jailed immediately.",
      "The case against Trafigura has had all the elements of a financial thriller: millions of dollars, shady middlemen and a chain of shell companies located in offshore havens like the Virgin Islands.",
      "Trafigura's strategy, the court heard, was to set up a complex payment web, through which an official with Angola's state oil company was paid almost $5m (\u00a34.02m; \u20ac4.81) between 2009 and 2011.",
      "Documents presented to the court by Swiss prosecutors showed payments authorised on Trafigura's own headed notepaper.",
      "The strategy appeared to work: over the next few years, the court heard, Angola signed contracts with Trafigura worth almost $144m (\u00a3115.93; \u20ac138.56).",
      "Trafigura, whose lawyers appeared bullish before the verdict, denied bribery. The company said its own compliance and anti-corruption measures had been independently assessed and found to be excellent.",
      "But the sheer weight of the evidence - which included dozens of documents, emails and memos - revealed a different picture: strict anti-corruption measures on paper but an intricate structure set up to evade those measures in reality. At the heart of it sat a middleman named \"Mr Non-Compliant\" in an anonymous Geneva office.",
      "The case will send a chill through commodity brokers worldwide but especially in Geneva, where Trafigura and many other commodity trading houses are headquartered.",
      "In an eerie coincidence, the night before the verdict was delivered, a fire broke out at the five star Hotel des Bergues - where, court documents showed, an Angolan official stayed at the expense of Trafigura in 2008.",
      "Swiss federal prosecutors hope the case will be a symbol that the old ways of doing business are finally over.",
      "They brought the charges to Switzerland's highest court, reserved for the worst crimes, such as terrorist offences.",
      "Trafigura now faces a large fine and Wainwright, who was in court for the verdict and denied the charges, was told he must serve at least one year of his 32 month sentence in jail.",
      "However, he was not immediately detained, pending the appeal he intends to lodge."

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:42:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to see planes start using the new runway in the next decade.",
    "story": [
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built and operating in a decade's time, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.",
      "Reeves told the BBC she wanted to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "She also said that Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London who is opposed to Heathrow's expansion, could not stop the new runway.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives were in favour of a third runway at Heathrow \"in principle\" but \"it remains to be seen\" whether it can be built in a decade.",
      "The extra runway at Heathrow was one of a number of infrastructure projects announced by the chancellor on Wednesday as part of the government's plans to boost economic growth.",
      "\"We think that we can get flights off within a decade,\" Reeves told the BBC.",
      "\"I say that because we're not just announcing that we back it, we are changing the way that our planning system works to make it easier to deliver projects like the third runway at Heathrow.\"",
      "When asked if Sadiq Khan could stop the expansion the chancellor said \"no\".",
      "\"There can be judicial reviews but we are confident that this airport expansion will happen, that we will get the third runway built,\" she said.",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway at Heathrow to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building the runway could take about seven years.",
      "The airport's expansion is highly controversial - facing opposition from environmental groups, local authorities and nearby residents.",
      "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has called the plan \"a dead cat\".",
      "\"If it ever arrives, it will be about 2040, 2045 or 2050... it will not deliver any growth,\" he said on Wednesday.",
      "Reeves backs third Heathrow runway in growth push",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "The Green Party has called Heathrow's expansion the \"definition of irresponsible\", with the party's co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, saying it was a \"fantasy\" that the projects could be done without environmental damage.",
      "Reeves was questioned over her previous opposition to the expansion of Leeds-Bradford airport over air and noise pollution grounds.",
      "\"If Leeds-Bradford came back with plans to expand I would support these because I think things have changed significantly in the past few years,\" she said.",
      "She said there were now more efficient plane engines and the use of sustainable aviation fuel was a \"game changer\".",
      "However, supplies of this fuel are currently very low. According to the European regulator EASA, they made up just 0.05% of the fuel used in the EU in 2020. It also costs much more than regular jet fuel.",
      "The UK government has introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate which stipulates that 2% of all jet fuel supplied this year must be SAF, increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.",
      "The director-general of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh,  has cast doubt on how quickly this can be achieved.",
      "\"Sustainable fuel is a real thing, but we need it in significantly greater volumes than are available today,\" he told LBC on Wednesday.",
      "\"Mandating airlines to use a fuel source that doesn't exist today doesn't make an awful lot of sense.\"",
      "Stride said that while the Conservatives backed the third runway in principle, \"it will take some considerable time\".",
      "\"If the government keeps pushing on this it will be maybe the 2040s or the 2050s or who knows before it comes off.\"",
      "Despite broadly backing plans to boost the UK's infrastructure, the Conservatives have argued tax rises in the Budget and planned changes to employment rights will damage growth.",
      "\"The biggest barriers to growth in this country are Rachel Reeves, Keir Starmer and their job-destroying Budget,\" Stride said.",
      "Will sustainable aviation fuels take off?",
      "How will the UK's growth plans affect me?",
      "Reeves's growth plan comes under scrutiny from her own side",
      "As well as announcing backing for a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor also said on Wednesday that other projects would be supported to try to boost growth in the economy.",
      "Expansions at Luton and Gatwick airports are being backed, as well as a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge, which she claimed could be \"Europe's Silicon Valley\".",
      "Reeves also told the BBC that when it came to planning and decision making over infrastructure projects \"we need to do things differently\".",
      "It emerged last year that the HS2 rail line was spending \u00a3100m on a shield to protect bats in ancient woodland in Buckinghamshire.",
      "The chancellor said: \"There are trade-offs and the balance has gone too far in the direction of always protecting every bat and every newt.\"",
      "The government is setting up a fund which builders can pay into to help nature restoration, \"but not necessarily in the place the development is happening\", Reeves said.",
      "\"So builders can get on and build, and that money can be used for nature restoration projects elsewhere.\"",
      "Separately, a leading economic think tank has warned that higher borrowing costs for the government may mean tax rises or spending cuts if it wants to stick to its own self-imposed rules.",
      "According to a report from the Resolution Foundation, the government is spending \u00a37bn a year more paying interest on its debt than it was at the time of the Budget.",
      "As a result, the think tank said higher tax or cuts \"may be needed\" if the government wants to keep its promise not to spend more day-to-day than it brings in through tax.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC its commitment to its fiscal rules is \"non-negotiable\".",

      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",

      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "The plan had been to unveil the $100bn figure in May, for the Foundation's 25th anniversary. But Gates revealed it exclusively to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",

      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",

      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",

I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "summary": "The chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",
    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Friends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".",
      "Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible, said: \"This huge increase in emissions won't help our economy, and would just encourage the small group of frequent flyers who take most of the flights.\"",
      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",
      "Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.",
      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",

      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",

      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",

      "The Fab Four picked up best rock performance for Now And Then, their \"final\" song, which was assembled from a demo by the late John Lennon; while the Stones won best rock album for their 2023 comeback, Hackney Diamonds.",
      "The awards were handed out at the Grammys' \"premiere ceremony\", which precedes the main event at 5pm Los Angeles / 1am London time.",
      "Other winners in the early stages included Sabrina Carpenter, who won best pop solo performance for her percolating summer anthem, Espresso; and British star Charli XCX, who scooped three prizes, including best dance/pop album for Brat.",
      "The show started with an all-star rendition of Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water, dedicated to the victims of the LA Wildfires.",
      "Yolanda Adams and Angelique Kidjo were among the artists performing a raw, gospel-infused version of the 60s classic, dedicated to the first responders who risked their lives to tackle the inferno and protect the vulnerable.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason Jr told the audience at the Crypto.com arena that the awards would \"honour music's great power to inspire, to heal and to unite\".",
      "He added: \"Because of the recent fires that devastated Los Angeles, we're also going to recognise the resilience of our community and celebrate our first responders and do our very best to lift up this city that we love.\"",

      "Beyonc\u00e9 is the main nominee at this year's ceremony, with her country-adjacent album Cowboy Carter shortlisted for 11 awards.",
      "She has already won best country performance by a duo or group, for her duet with Miley Cyrus, II Most Wanted.",
      "However, she was beaten to best country song by Kacey Musgraves, whose song The Architect questions the existence of God after a school shooting.",
      "Taking to the stage, Musgraves said: \"There's so much darkness in the world right now, and it just feels so good to be able to fight some of that darkness through song\".",
      "Musgraves previously won album of the year in 2019 for Golden Hour.",
      "The nominees for that prize this year include Billie Eilish, Beyonc\u00e9 (who has never won the category, despite four previous nominations) Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan and rapper Andr\u00e9 3000, who is nominated for his spiritual jazz flute album New Blue Sun.",
      "Charli XCX and Sabrina Carpenter are also up for best album - and fans are already speculating whether their early wins increase their odds of taking the night's biggest prize.",
      "Neither artist was there in person to collect their initial trophies, as they are due to perform at the headline ceremony later in the evening.",
      "However Charli's producer, Finn Keane, accepted the award for dance/pop single (Von Dutch) on her behalf, calling her an \"amazing collaborator\".",
      "\"She has been making this kind of music for 10 years, but everyone's just caught up to it,\" he added.",
      "Her album, Brat, also won the \"best packaging\" award, recognising the deliberately ugly, low resolution lime green artwork that became a key part of her branding last year.",
      "John Lennon's son, Sean Ono Lennon, picked up the Beatles' award, calling them \"the greatest band of all time\".",
      "\"I just want to say, play the Beatles music to your kids,\" he added. \"I feel like the world can't afford to forget about people like the Beatles. We need this music in the world, we need peace and love, and we need the magic of the '60s to stay alive.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Kendrick Lamar won three consecutive prizes - best rap song, best rap performance and best music video - for Not Like US, his no-holds-barred takedown of fellow musician Drake.",
      "His producer, Mustard, accepted the awards, noting: \"He performed his ass off on that song, didn't he?\""

    "title": "How LA fires devastation will change the Grammys this year",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 05:06:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Showrunners say the ceremony will look different as they honour fire victims and first responders.",
    "story": [
      "The week leading up to the Grammy Awards is typically a star-studded seven days.",
      "It is filled with exclusive parties that draw some of music's top talents from across the globe - producers, singers, agents and musicians - all to the epicentre of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles.",
      "But nearly all of that is non-existent this year. Even the hallmark rowdy after-parties have been cancelled.",
      "There were questions over whether the Grammys ceremony, the \"Oscars for Music,\" would even go on as planned on Sunday after Los Angeles saw its most devastating fire disaster ever recorded - blazes that were only fully doused on Friday after burning for 24 days.",
      "Twenty-nine people have died and more than 16,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed - with whole neighbourhoods now ash. Many artists and industry professionals are among those who lost homes, studios and equipment.",
      "In the muted lead-up to the show, efforts usually put toward parties have gone instead toward fundraising efforts. Showrunners say the ceremony itself will also look different.",
      "To cancel the show or not?",
      "The Recording Academy, which runs the show, said the show is needed more than ever. Trustees say the evening will double as a charitable event to raise money and honour both the victims and the emergency responders who risked their lives.",
      "But it will look different than years past.",
      "Showrunners are looking to strike the right tone honouring the victims of the fire and displaying a defiant Los Angeles that will persevere. But there is concern the optics of rich celebrities dolled up with smiles on a red carpet could come off as tone deaf.",
      "Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said that the show include a reimagined format, scaled-back red carpet and a more reflective tone.",
      "He highlighted the economic impact, noting that thousands rely on Grammy-related work, particularly in the service industry. He framed the event as a symbol of resilience, arguing that cancelling would not benefit the city or music industry.",
      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",
      "Mr Mason told the New York Times that they consulted a range of public officials about whether they should hold the event - including the city's mayor and California Governor Gavin Newsom - and whether it would hinder fire response efforts.",
      "\"They strongly suggested that we continue forward with hosting the event,\" he told the outlet. \"Everyone said there's nothing good that comes from postponing.\"",
      "But there are still worries that the night will be a bad look for the music industry.",
      "\"I actually don't think that the Grammys should be happening,\" Elyn Kazarian, a creative director in the music industry, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's just very weird to me that there are going to be celebrities on a red carpet wearing expensive clothes while people in other parts of the city are suffering and whose livelihoods have been destroyed.\"",

      "Will the show look different?",
      "Showrunners say the fires will be a theme that runs throughout the ceremony and the city of Los Angeles will be centre stage.",
      "Ben Winston, one of the three executive producers of the show, told the New York Times that the awards will \"make LA a character in the night of Grammys\" and the show would pay tribute to first responders.",
      "A big aim of the show will be fundraising for fire relief efforts.",
      "Just days before the show, another big music event in the city raised millions for rebuilding efforts. The FireAid concert, hosted in two LA arenas with more than two dozen musical acts, raised more than $60 million in ticket sales alone.",
      "The Grammys will run for a staggering eight hours and hand out 94 awards, recognising everything from best pop album to best choral performance.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift will both be in attendance as they square off in the album of the year category for the first time since 2010 - which Swift won that year.",
      "There will also be performances from Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone, Shakira, Stevie Wonder, Teddy Swims and Raye - and an in memoriam tribute to Thriller producer Quincy Jones.",
      "Previous tragedies have impacted the Grammys",
      "This is not the first time a major disruption has impacted the music industry's biggest night.",
      "In 2021, the show was postponed due to Covid-19 and was significantly altered to accommodate safety protocols. It featured a socially distanced format, with no live audience and pre-recorded performances in an intimate outdoor setting rather than the usual large-scale arena production.",
      "Artists had to adjust to a new way of promoting their music, relying on digital platforms rather than in-person Grammy week events, which were either cancelled or moved online.",
      "\"I wouldn't necessarily compare the COVID pandemic to what's happening here,\" senior music writer for Variety, Steven J Horowitz, told the BBC. \"COVID lasted for so long and the effects were devastating for years. People had to cancel major releases, and everything shifted to a digital space.\"",
      "He said the fires are different.",
      "\"The industry has reacted in real time. It's not as widespread as a worldwide pandemic, so people are a little more flexible on how to properly react and help those affected,\" he said.",
      "Maps and images reveal scale of LA wildfire devastation",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 passes Jay-Z in all-time Grammy nominations",
      "How the industry has been impacted",
      "Artist Manager Dani Chavez told the BBC that the fires have affected many people working in LA's music industry.",
      "\"I know multiple musicians who lost their gear\", Chavez said. \"I know stylists who work in music who lost their houses, who had costumes and whatnot. I know musicians who are born and raised in LA who lost their house.\"",
      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events before the show helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",
      "One of the most sought-after parties is Spotify's event honouring the nominees for Best New Artist of the year. It is half party, half concert, with previous nominees showcasing their new music, and celebrities from all parts of the entertainment industry there to celebrate.",
      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing. It's not going to stop L.A. from being one of the main hubs for music in the world.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 15:39:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift have both confirmed their attendance, as they square off in the album of the year category for the first time since 2010",
    "story": [
      "The Grammys are music's biggest night, both literally and figuratively.",
      "The ceremony, which takes place in LA on Sunday night, runs for a staggering eight hours, attracting the biggest stars in pop, rock, country and hip-hop.",
      "Organisers will hand out 94 awards, recognising everything from best pop album to best choral performance.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift have both confirmed their attendance, as they square off in the album of the year category for the first time since 2010 (Swift won on that occasion, fact fans).",
      "There'll also be performances from Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone, Shakira, Stevie Wonder, Teddy Swims and Raye - and an in memoriam tribute to Thriller producer Quincy Jones.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the ceremony.",
      "1) Who's going to win album of the year?",
      "The big question of the night is whether Beyonc\u00e9 will finally win album of the year, after four previous losses in the category?",
      "During last year's ceremony, her husband Jay-Z addressed the oversight, telling the audience: \"I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's latest record, Cowboy Carter, is a wildly ambitious attempt to contextualise and commemorate the black roots of country music. It's the sort of thing that delights Grammy voters, who traditionally prefer albums that elevate America's musical history over contemporary, cutting-edge productions.",
      "But the album's excessive length - including a few weaker tracks in its latter half - could count against it.",
      "Billie Eilish is currently the bookmakers' favourite with her third album Hit Me Hard and Soft. Mixing passionate power ballads with violent electronic shifts and hip-hop swagger, it marks a new evolution in the star's songwriting partnership with her brother, Finneas.",
      "Charli XCX's Brat is a career-defining pop record that became a cultural phenomenon. The best-reviewed album of 2024, it's probably too abrasive for the Grammys' more conservative voters, but that's their loss.",
      "And you'd have to be crazy to ignore Taylor Swift. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, was the biggest-seller of last year; a fact that will undoubtedly be taken into account, even if the record is one of her weaker efforts.",
      "If she wins, Swift will collect her fifth album of the year trophy - more than any other artist in Grammy history.",
      "2) What about the other big prizes?",
      "One of the year's most stacked categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".",
      "Aside from a rogue nomination for The Beatles (see below), the shortlist reflects a stellar year for pop music, with Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso and Charli XCX's 360 up against Beyonc\u00e9's Texas Hold 'Em and Billie Eilish's Birds Of A Feather.",
      "But the front-runner is Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us. A furious take-down of his rap nemesis, Drake, it's as catchy as it is legally contentious. If it wins, it would be only the second hip-hop single to win the category, following Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019.",
      "In the parallel song of the year prize - which recognises achievement in songwriting - the smart money is on Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's Die With A Smile.",
      "Both artists are perennial Grammy favourites, and their virtuoso ballad will be catnip to voters.",
      "Their competition includes Shaboozey's A Bar Song (Tipsy), which was America's longest-running number one single of 2024. However, the fact that it's based on a previous hit (J-Kwon's Tipsy) is likely to count against it.",
      "Chappell Roan's breakout single Good Luck Babe is another strong contender, notable for its soaring high notes and a piercing lyric that skewers internalised homophobia. Billie Eilish's gossamer ballad Birds of a Feather is a similar masterclass in songcraft - making this category one of the hardest to predict.",
      "By contrast, the coveted best new artist prize is pretty much a two-way split between Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, both of whom established a dominant chart presence in 2024 after years on the pop sidelines.",
      "That's bad news for the sole British nominee, six-time Brit Award winner Raye. But at least she's in good company, alongside breakout rap star Doechii and big-hearted pop singer Teddy Swims.",

      "Chappell Roan interview: 'I'd be more successful if I wore a muzzle'",
      "3) Which Grammy records could be broken?",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter has 11 nominations, potentially making it the most-rewarded album in Grammy history.",
      "The record is currently held by Santana, who got nine trophies for his album Supernatural in 2000 (coincidentally, the same year that Beyonc\u00e9 received her first Grammy nomination, as part of Destiny's Child).",
      "And if Cowboy Carter doesn't take home best album, Beyonc\u00e9 still breaks a record, for the most nominations in that category without a win.",
      "Billie Eilish could become the first female artist to win Record of the Year three times with Birds of a Feather. Paul Simon and Bruno Mars are the only other artist with three wins in the category.",
      "Rapper turned flautist Andr\u00e9 3000 is also poised to make history. If he wins best instrumental composition, he does so with the longest song title in Grammy history: I Swear, I Really Wanted To Make A 'Rap' Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time.",
      "The current record holders, in case you were wondering, are Oklahoma band The Flaming Lips. In 2007, they won best rock instrumental performance for the magnificently-titled The Wizard Turns on the Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts On His Werewolf Moccasins.",
      "4) Who votes for the Grammys?",
      "More than 13,000 members of the Recording Academy vote for the Grammys every year - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write CD liner notes.",
      "To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (\u00a3120). All former winners are also eligible to vote.",
      "Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.",
      "Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.",
      "The 2025 awards recognise music released between 16 September 2023 and 30 August, 2024. The winners are not revealed until the ceremony.",
      "5) How did The Beatles get nominated?",
      "The Beatles might have broken up 55 years ago, but they're up for two prizes on Sunday: record of the year and best rock performance.",
      "Both nominations recognise Now and Then, a song that John Lennon demoed in the 1970s, and which was finally completed by his surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr last year.",
      "Grammy voters, with their eyes firmly trained on the past, rarely miss an opportunity to reward the Beatles. Eight years ago, for example, the band's documentary Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years beat Beyonc\u00e9's groundbreaking Lemonade for best music film.",
      "In some ways, that's correcting an historic wrong. In their prime, the Beatles were nominated for record of the year four times - for I Want to Hold Your Hand, Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be - but lost every time.",
      "A win in 2025 would prove that Beatlemania never fades - but voters may be put off by The Beatles' use of machine learning (a form of artificial intelligence), which was used to clean up Lennon's scratchy old cassette recordings.",
      "The Recording Academy's rules on AI say that \"only human creators\" can win Grammys, and that \"the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful\".",
      "That's true in the case of Now And Then, but many creators remain sceptical of the technology.",
      "6) How will the California wildfires affect the ceremony?",
      "Quite a lot.",
      "All the hoopla surrounding the Grammys has gone. No pre-parties, no after-parties. Everything except the ceremony itself has been cancelled. All the money that would have been spent on champagne and vol au vents is being funnelled into relief efforts.",
      "The Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity have also set up a Fire Relief fund, which has so far pledged more than $3.2 million (\u00a32.6 million) in emergency aid to assist music professionals affected by the fires.",
      "And the telecast itself will reflect the devastation, with segments honouring the first responders who risked their lives to tackle the inferno and protect the vulnerable.",
      "\"We'll still have performances, we'll still have awards and honour music,\" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason, Jr told Variety magazine.",

      "Musicians, however take the Grammys very seriously indeed. A big win can boost album sales and bump you up festival bills.",
      "That said, the awards themselves are notoriously ridiculous. According to legend, they were created in 1959 as a panicked reaction to the popularity of rock 'n' roll. Record companies hoped that by highlighting \"good\" music, they'd steer the public away from Elvis's swivelling hips.",
      "As if to illustrate that point, they didn't hand Mr Presley a trophy until 1968, and even that was for \"best sacred performance\", recognising his first gospel album, How Great Thou Art.",
      "Since then, the awards have remained wilfully arbitrary, woefully out of touch, or a combination of the two.",
      "Famously, The Beatles won more awards after they split up than they did together; and there were no rap categories until 1989.",
      "And if anyone still thinks that Herbie Hancock's jazz tribute to Joni Mitchell was the best album of 2008 - the year of Amy Winehouse's Back To Black and Kanye West's Graduation - I'd be interested to hear your arguments.",
      "So if Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't win on Sunday (or even if she does) don't let it affect your enjoyment of her music."

      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is then alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",

      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",

    "summary": "Ellen Elphick said teachers at the school had left her with lifelong psychological damage.",
    "story": [
      "The Royal Ballet School (RBS) has reached a financial settlement with a former student, who said the body-shaming she experienced while at the elite institution has left her with lifelong psychological damage.",
      "Ellen Elphick, 31, had claimed the London-based school breached its duty of care when she attended between 2009 and 2012.",
      "The school said it accepted no liability for the former dancer's case and has not issued an apology.",
      "\"We are pleased that both parties were able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement in this way and we wish Ellen and her family well for the future,\" said an RBS spokesperson - adding that the school \"continues to take the welfare of its students very seriously\".",
      "Last year, when Ellen spoke to the BBC she described how, as a 16-year-old, just two weeks into her training, a teacher publicly humiliated her by tracing a line around her body in front of a mirror.",
      "\"If I had a knife, this is what I would cut off,\" Ellen says the teacher said.",
      "The comment plunged Ellen into shame, she says, and exacerbated her struggles with disordered eating. She later received a diagnosis of atypical anorexia and body dysmorphia",
      "She said there was a pattern of similar comments from multiple teachers at the school, that further eroded her confidence and intensified her eating disorder.",
      "\"This settlement highlights the abuse dancers have suffered and the need for change,\" said Dino Nocivelli of Leigh Day solicitors - who has been representing Ellen.",

      "She said she had pursued legal action to bring attention to the harm caused by body-shaming in ballet. The financial terms of her settlement have not been publicly disclosed.",
      "\"It wasn't about the money,\" she said.",
      "\"It was about making people aware of what being a ballerina is really like and showing that what happened to me was unacceptable.\"",
      "Although she says she feels some validation from the settlement, Ellen expressed disappointment at the lack of an apology from RBS. \"That they couldn't even say 'sorry' shows there is so much more to do,\" she said.",
      "Now a mother, she said she wanted to shield her daughter from the ballet world and would \"never\" send her to ballet classes.",
      "However, she hopes her case could lead to meaningful reform and that ballet schools will prioritise students' mental health and train teachers to understand the impact of their words.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:52:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Staff felt they could not speak up with concerns about the star's behaviour, an internal review finds.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".",
      "The apology came as the BBC published the findings of an internal review into Brand's time as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008.",
      "The investigation considered eight complaints, two of which were made while he worked for the corporation.",
      "One of those, which related to him urinating into a cup and behaving aggressively during his Radio 2 show, was registered formally at the time, and the BBC has now admitted it was \"not dealt with effectively\".",
      "The BBC launched the investigation after separate allegations in 2023 from several women who accused the 49-year-old actor and comedian of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.",
      "Brand has denied all allegations and said his relationships were \"always consensual\".",
      "'Stayed silent'",
      "Thursday's report found that \"only one formal complaint was made about Brand's inappropriate conduct in the workplace\" during his stint on air, and beyond that there was \"no evidence that his behaviour was raised with management formally at the time\".",
      "But the BBC acknowledged that Brand was \"perceived to be too influential\" for staff to complain about.",
      "Many of those interviewed for the internal investigation \"believed, rightly or wrongly, that Russell Brand would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\", the report said. They also believed he \"had the support of the station management\".",
      "While one informal complaint was also made, the report said \"it is clear that there were other concerns but those involved felt unable or unwilling to raise these at the time as they felt the concerns would not be taken seriously and the systems for making complaints were not as clear as they are now\".",
      "Competition winner",
      "Commenting on the report, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the complaints were \"horrendous\".",
      "\"As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously,\" she said.",
      "She added that the BBC must \"take action to reassure its staff and the wider public that it takes these issues seriously\".",
      "\"For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand's has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.\"",
      "The review also found that Brand had consensual sex with a competition winner from his 6 Music show on BBC premises.",
      "Speaking to the review team, that person said that while what happened was consensual, they now felt \"Brand had abused his position and taken advantage of them\".",
      "The report added that there were \"management failings\" and \"there should have been better systems in place to ensure that Brand's unacceptable behaviour was promptly picked up and addressed\".",
      "Channel 4, where Brand also worked as a presenter, released its own internal review findings in March 2024. Its boss apologised to a former employee after the probe found it had not investigated a \"serious\" complaint made against the star in 2009.",
      "Brand has been interviewed three times by police since September 2023.",
      "In November 2024, the Metropolitan Police sent the Crown Prosecution Service a file of evidence, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges.",
      "'Not taken seriously'",
      "A BBC employee made a formal complaint to a manager in 2007 after Brand urinated into a cup in the Radio 2 studio, and then threw objects in anger when one of the production team made a mistake during a second show.",
      "The report said it was likely that this was then raised verbally with the Radio 2 controller at the time, Lesley Douglas, although she does \"not recall these concerns ever being raised with her\".",
      "Douglas denied that Brand ever sought to exercise any influence over her, and said her relationship with him was similar to that she had with other presenters on the station.",
      "The BBC made light of the 2007 incident in a press response at the time, the report said, when a spokesperson told the Independent that Brand had urinated in a cup \"and someone has shown him where the toilet is\".",
      "\"Regrettably this incident was not taken seriously at this time,\" the report said.",
      "Another staff member said they had raised concerns informally about Brand's conduct in 2006 and 2007, the report said.",
      "Someone else alleged that Brand \"tucked his fingers down their trousers and underwear and pulled them towards him\" in a corridor while on set of a BBC radio production, but did not complain at the time.",
      "Staff members who were \"most closely\" involved in his shows described his behaviour in general as \"promiscuous or out-of-control\", but said they did not \"witness anything non-consensual or potentially illegal\".",
      "'Inadequate' complaint handling",
      "Another complaint was made to the BBC about an incident in Los Angeles in 2008.",
      "Brand is alleged to have followed \"Olivia\" into a bathroom and shown his penis to her moments before he began pre-recording his radio show.",
      "The woman, who was not a BBC employee but worked in the same building, did not complain at the time, thinking \"she would not be believed\".",
      "The report found no evidence of anyone in BBC management being aware of Olivia's experience at the time.",
      "In 2019, a BBC News staff member raised the incident with their line manager after Olivia confirmed she wanted to take the matter further.",
      "\"It is likely those involved in escalating the complaint in 2019 felt that there was nothing that could be done as it was over ten years later,\" the report said.",
      "It concluded that the complaint process was \"inadequate\", as was the handling of the 2019 complaint, and the BBC has apologised to Olivia.",
      "Another of the complaints in the report was made by a woman named Alice, who said a car provided by the BBC for Brand collected her and took her to his house when he was in his 30s and she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl.",
      "The report concluded that it was not able to verify these claims but it was \"unlikely that the cars described by Alice were chauffeur-driven BBC cars or BBC management cars\".",
      "The report, and Alice, agree that if Brand did \"persuade a taxi or mini-cab pre-booked on his behalf by the BBC to make these journeys, it's likely to have been done without the knowledge of the BBC staff who booked his cars for him in advance\".",
      "The review cost \u00a3662,062 and was conducted by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston.",
      "He added: \"The processes for raising any concerns were also not as developed as they are now.",

      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "The plan had been to unveil the $100bn figure in May, for the Foundation's 25th anniversary. But Gates revealed it exclusively to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",

      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",

      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "summary": "Is skinny back for good? We speak to designers, casting agents and models at Paris Fashion Week.",
    "story": [
      "The high fashion industry has always been synonymous with thinness, but for a brief moment in the 2010s, the body positivity movement was at the forefront.",
      "It promised a revolution of accepting bodies of all shapes and sizes, welcomed curves and advocated for inclusion, particularly on the runway.",
      "But 10 years on, industry insiders tell us things have shifted. Was body positivity a flash-in-the-pan trend? And with help with weight loss medication such as Ozempic, is skinny back for good?",
      "We speak to designers, casting agents and models at Paris Fashion Week to investigate what is happening.",
      "The 2010s: The era of body positivity",
      "The body positivity movement finds its origins in the hazy days of the 1960s and was helped by icons like Marilyn Monroe who broadened Hollywood's rigid beauty standard.",
      "It was brought to the forefront again in the 2010s, when Instagram was launched and influencers began to highlight fashion and beauty outside of the glossy magazines and runways.",
      "Helping this was the celebrity Kardashian family, whose curves triggered BBLs  (Brazilian butt lift surgery) around the world.",
      "Enrika, a 28-year-old plus-sized model, said: \"When the body positivity movement emerged, it felt incredibly empowering and liberating.\"",
      "\"It felt like an act of rebellion - what had always been criticised was now being appreciated. It was as if we had finally had enough of being judged.\"",
      "Plus-size models were being booked for big brands, including Rihanna's highly coveted lingerie label, 'Savage x Fenty' which launched in 2018.",
      "The brand, valued at $1bn, became known for its runway extravaganzas, reminiscent of a modern alternative to the iconic Victoria's Secret shows, but this time with every body type on display.",
      "Felicity Hayward, a 36-year-old plus-sized model, reflects on being scouted in 2011.",
      "\"When I got that call from my first modelling agency Storm - who discovered Kate Moss - I thought I was being punk'd,\" she said.",
      "\"Before the 2010s, attitudes around bigger bodies weren't positive and I never thought being a plus-size model was a possibility.",
      "\"Seeing that narrative change over the last decade and a half has been life changing both emotionally, physically and financially.\"",
      "The 2020s: The era of Ozempic",
      "But then around 2020, progress started to slow. And come the autumn and winter of 2024, of the 8,800 looks across 230 shows, just 0.8 per cent were on plus-size models, Vogue reports.",
      "At the same time, a new weight loss drug used to treat diabetes came onto the market and skyrocketed in popularity.  Semaglutide, also known as Ozempic and Wegovy, curbs the appetite of users, and was approved by the NHS for weight loss in 2023.",
      "Celebrities including Elon Musk started crediting the drug for their newly slim frame and it was only a matter of time before that trickled down to consumers.",
      "As Ozempic and its counterparts become more commercially available for aesthetic purposes, industry insiders claim it has affected the body positivity movement.",
      "Model, Moya, said: \"We've seen how quickly the narrative shifted, with celebrities and influencers using surgeries or medication like Ozempic to chase what's considered 'in Vogue'.\"",
      "Another model, Jenny, said: \"When I realised skinny was back, it was positive because I was going to get more jobs.",
      "\"But I've realised it means now I have to keep up. Now I have to be the skinniest.\"",
      "Even the editorial director of British Vogue said that the fashion industry \"should be concerned\" by a recent trend back to using more skinny models",
      "Chioma Nnadi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:  \"I do think maybe perhaps Ozempic has something to do with it.\"",
      "\"We're in this moment where we're seeing the pendulum sort of swing back to skinny being 'in' and often these things are treated like a trend and we don't want them to be.\"",
      "Then Berlin brand, Namilia, went viral for an \"I love Ozempic\" T-shirt on their 2024 Fashion Week runway.",
      "\"The 'I love Ozempic' tee really hit a nerve,\" laughed Nan Li, the brand's creative director who claims the T-shirt was satire.",
      "\"With the rise of Ozempic, so many people are using it. Over the last few years, celebrities just lost weight and didn't talk about it.\"",
      "Paris 'celebrates elitism'",
      "Fast-forward to January, when Men's AW25 Fashion Week lands in Paris and audiences get a litmus test in real-time of exactly where brands stand.",
      "Aside from a selection of designers, including Rick Owens, LGN and Charles Jeffrey LOVERBOY, I can count on two hands how many plus-sized models I saw at a week of shows.",
      "Nan Li said: \"Paris celebrates elitism, and elitism means skinny and white.\"",
      "\"There's a handful of plus-sized models [at the shows] but they're not really plus - they're normal-sized. They are cast in every show to make the brand appear body positive.\"",
      "Amidst the hustle and bustle of fashion week, Shaun Beyen, casting director for iconic French brand Fursac, told the BBC: \"The only motivation for a brand is to sell clothes - that's it. I don't think we need to lie about this.",
      "\"Brands adopted body positivity in the 2010s because in part they saw it as a commercial opportunity, and when they saw it was no longer performing as they would hope in 2020, they hopped off.\"",
      "Beyen added: \"Full transparency - I don't really want to see clothes on someone like me. I want to see it on somebody I aspire to look like.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello, Fursac's creative director, laughed in agreement and said: \"I hate my body. I don't want to see clothes on people like me.\"",
      "On the other hand, designers like Charles Jeffrey believe brands have a moral imperative to cast inclusively. \"Body positivity was never a trend for me,\" he said. \"It was an opportunity to start being responsible.\"",
      "Body positivity is knitted into the very fabric of Charles' brand, which takes inspiration from the queer nightlife scene. This is readily apparent throughout his Paris Fashion Week show.",
      "The designer explained: \"The people in my shows are people I was clubbing with. It was never about models, it was my friends and their different body shapes. It was about the community I surrounded myself with.\"",
      "Body positivity 'taken a backseat now'",
      "It seem the reality is that designers like Charles are the exception to the rule. As much as activists resist it, industry insiders confirm that body positivity is behind us.",
      "Daniel Mitchell-Jones, co-founder of modelling agency Chapter Management, said: \"Yes, things have shifted. In 2020 and 2021, we saw so much more diversity and inclusion on the runways - but body-wise, that's taken a backseat now.\"",
      "Daniel said when he sends his curve models to castings, they're always pushed, but is often told the brand isn't interested this season.",
      "Plus-size model Enrika told the BBC that not only are plus-sized models being booked less, their agents are actively struggling to secure work for them.",
      "She explained: \"It's not unusual to see campaigns featuring four sample-size models and only one plus-size model. This can make you feel like you're just a token.\"",
      "Enrika said these brands sometimes often use tactics in campaigns to virtue-signal being inclusive - such as highlighting stretch marks on plus-sized models, whilst airbrushing them on others.",
      "She said: \"It sends the message that 'We don't actually think you look as good as the slim models in our skirt. But we accept you because we are such kind-hearted good people, so please give us your hard-earned money', it's nasty work and I don't support it.\"",
      "If you want change, change your buying habits. At least, that's what Shaun Beyen, believes: \"Everything is consumer-driven\".",
      "\"It's this kind of vicious circle. Every fashion house gives their version of what they know the customer wants, it's their interpretation and it's up to the consumer.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello said: \"There's a famous French saying: 'If people stop producing, people will stop buying.' But the inverse is true. If people stop buying, we stop producing.",
      "\"No-one is forcing you to do anything. It's an education of the customer: In a polite way - educate yourself.\"",
      "And the one benefit of bodies as trends is that the pendulum will eventually swing back. Beyen said: \"Nothing is ever gone, especially not in fashion.\"",

    "story": [
      "For Christmas I received an interesting gift from a friend - my very own \"best-selling\" book.",
      "\"Tech-Splaining for Dummies\" (great title) bears my name and my photo on its cover, and it has glowing reviews.",
      "Yet it was entirely written by AI, with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet.",
      "It's an interesting read, and very funny in parts. But it also meanders quite a lot, and is somewhere between a self-help book and a stream of anecdotes.",
      "It mimics my chatty style of writing, but it's also a bit repetitive, and very verbose. It may have gone beyond Janet's prompts in collating data about me.",
      "Several sentences begin \"as a leading technology journalist\u2026\" \u2013 cringe \u2013 which could have been scraped from an online bio.",
      "There's also a mysterious, repeated hallucination in the form of my cat (I have no pets). And there's a metaphor on almost every page \u2013 some more random than others.",
      "There are dozens of companies online offering AI-book writing services. My book was from BookByAnyone.",
      "When I contacted the chief executive Adir Mashiach, based in Israel, he told me he had sold around 150,000 personalised books, mainly in the US, since pivoting from compiling AI-generated travel guides in June 2024.",
      "A paperback copy of your own 240-page long best-seller costs \u00a326. The firm uses its own AI tools to generate them, based on an open source large language model.",
      "I'm not asking you to buy my book. Actually you can't \u2013 only Janet, who created it, can order any further copies.",
      "There is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody's name, including celebrities \u2013 although Mr Mashiach says there are guardrails around abusive content. Each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional, created by AI, and designed \"solely to bring humour and joy\".",
      "Legally, the copyright belongs to the firm, but Mr Mashiach stresses that the product is intended as a \"personalised gag gift\", and the books do not get sold further.",
      "He hopes to broaden his range, generating different genres such as sci-fi, and perhaps offering an autobiography service. It's designed to be a light-hearted form of consumer AI \u2013 selling AI-generated goods to human customers.",
      "It's also a bit terrifying if, like me, you write for a living. Not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate, and it does, certainly in some parts, sound just like me.",
      "Musicians, authors, artists and actors worldwide have expressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it.",
      "\"We should be clear, when we are talking about data here, we actually mean human creators' life works,\" says Ed Newton Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights.",
      "\"This is books, this is articles, this is photos. It's works of art. It's records\u2026 The whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that.\"",
      "In 2023 a song featuring AI-generated voices of Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd went viral on social media before being pulled from streaming platforms because it was not their work and they had not consented to it. It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

      "The UK government is considering an overhaul of the law that would allow AI developers to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders opt out.",

      "\"The government is undermining one of its best performing industries on the vague promise of growth.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"No move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives: increased control for right holders to help them license their content, access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK, and more transparency for right holders from AI developers.\"",

      "But this has now been repealed by Trump. It remains to be seen what Trump will do instead, but he is said to want the AI sector to face less regulation.",
      "This comes as a number of lawsuits against AI firms, and particularly against OpenAI, continue in the US. They have been taken out by everyone from the New York Times to authors, music labels, and even a comedian.",
      "They claim that the AI firms broke the law when they took their content from the internet without their consent, and used it to train their systems.",
      "The AI companies argue that their actions fall under \"fair use\" and are therefore exempt.

      "DeepSeek claims that it developed its technology for a fraction of the price of the likes of OpenAI. Its success has raised security concerns in the US, and threatens American's current dominance of the sector.",
      "As for me and a career as an author, I think that at the moment, if I really want a \"bestseller\" I'll still have to write it myself. If anything, Tech-Splaining for Dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects. It is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations, and it can be quite difficult to read in parts because it's so long-winded.",

      "Allegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.",
      "\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.",
      "\"A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\"",
      "Faithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.",
      "The lyrics - the authorship of which were later the subject of a legal dispute with the band - are a terrifying insight into the effect of heroin and cocaine addiction: \"The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears. Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?\"",
      "The relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.",
      "At the same time, Faithfull lost custody of her son and her life began to spiral out of control.",
      "A suicide attempt left her in a coma, and she ended up an alcoholic, anorexic heroin addict living in a bomb-damaged building in London's Soho.",
      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",
      "\"It was all too much for me,\" she explained. \"I really didn't like my gilded cage.\"",
      "Occasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.",
      "Her voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.",
      "But, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.",
      "Gone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.",
      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",
      "But she never quite lost the creative spark.",
      "In recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.",
      "And Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".",
      "It was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.",
      "\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"",
      "It also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.",
      "\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"",
      "Marianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.",
      "But her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 01:25:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The Scottish rock band explain how music helped them through a tough period in their personal lives.",
    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",
      "\"He was like, 'Wait, your last album went to number one?' And we were like, 'Yeah'.",
      "\"And he was like, 'Wow, that's weird'.\"",
      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "Lawyers acting for three people - including campaigner Keira Bell - have written to Streeting urging him to introduce a ban as he has done for puberty blockers for children questioning their gender identity.",
      "Ms Bell says her life has been \"flipped upside down\" by taking the drugs that have some irreversible effects. The other two people involved are parents and wish to remain anonymous.",
      "Cross-sex hormone therapy is used to help people transition to a different gender from the one they were born into.",
      "In December the health secretary announced an indefinite ban on puberty-suppressing drugs for gender dysphoria.",

      "The lawyers said private clinics are providing these to under 18s, despite the fact that they pose at least an equal risk as puberty blockers.",
      "The letter, seen by the BBC, points to potential health risks to children's developing brains, bones and reproductive system.",
      "Keira Bell has previously taken legal action against the NHS - after her treatment when she was a teenager more than a decade ago at what was then the only NHS gender clinic.",
      "She was given puberty blockers at 16 and then the male hormone testosterone at 17 before having surgery to remove her breasts.",
      "Ms Bell, 28, told BBC News: \"I was very vulnerable and was dealing with a lot of issues.",
      "\"With cross-sex hormones... it changes not only your physical and mental state, but also your social state, especially for females who are taking testosterone. I'm one of those people.\"",

      "\"Things can feel very urgent so it is important for young people to remember that your whole life is ahead of you.",
      "\"This sort of protection needs to be put into law,\" she says.",
      "Paul Conrathe, the lawyer who is representing Ms Bell and the two other individuals, said: \"Given what we know about the unscrupulous and harmful practices of unregulated overseas gender clinics it is remarkable that the secretary of state has not banned the prescription of cross-sex hormones.",
      "\"He banned puberty blockers, but failed to ban even more harmful cross-sex hormones that expose children to irreversible lifelong changes.",
      "\"This harmful trade continues unashamed and emboldened at the failure of the government to protect vulnerable children.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care did not respond directly to the threat of a judicial review, but said it was working with regulators to tighten up rules around private provision of cross-sex hormones.",
      "A spokeswoman pointed out that the landmark Cass Review into gender care published last year did not call for a ban of cross-sex hormones for those aged 16 to 18.",
      "She added that \"additional safeguards\" were being put in place in the NHS with a group of health professionals now reviewing cases before cross-sex hormones are given to young people.",
      "The NHS can prescribe cross-sex hormones to under 18s.",
      "But the Cass Review found that there was a lack of research and \"weak evidence\" for medical interventions.",
      "As a result, NHS England wrote to all NHS gender clinics saying \"extreme caution\" should be exercised before recommending cross-sex hormones for under 18s.",
      "Changes are being made to the way NHS gender services for children are run with a move away from medical interventions and a greater focus on wider needs, including with mental health. Puberty blockers are no longer used by them at all - except in clinical trials.",
      "The legal move comes as the courts continue to hear the case involving a mother who is trying to stop her 16-year-old being given cross-sex hormones to change their gender.",
      "The case will return to the High Court on Friday.",
      "Between the ages of 16 and 18, whilst not legally an adult, a young person is usually viewed as being able to make their own medical decisions."

      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",
      "\"These nurses have seen everything,\" Megan adds.",
      "Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says \"you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things\".",
      "While most people only feel light pain at their appointments, some people do experience more discomfort at their appointments.",
      "\"Some people find cervical screening uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful,\" the Eve Appeal says. It notes that some conditions like endometriosis, vaginismus and being menopausal can make the screening painful.",
      "The NHS says that patients are in control of screening and \"can ask the nurse to stop at any time\".",
      "Did you know about the adjustments available?",
      "People can ask for adjustments to make their screening easier or more comfortable. These include:",

      "Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations.",
      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",
      "But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot.",
      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",
      "Trans and non-binary people who have a cervix should still have regular cervical screenings.",
      "Jack says he'd put off the appointment out of fear, until he went for a blood test in summer 2024 and the nurse offered him a cervical screening on the spot.",
      "\"It was so much quicker and much less of a bigger deal,\" Jack says. \"It's nowhere near as bad as you think it will be.\"",
      "Some trans men previously told the BBC they had not been invited to get cervical screenings because they were listed as male on medical records, though they still had a cervix.",
      "How could the process be improved?",
      "The NHS wants to encourage more people to go for their cervical screenings. NHS England has promised to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040.",
      "Women aged 25-49 are encouraged to have a screening every three years, while women aged 50-64 should have one every five years.",
      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS national clinical director for women's health, told the BBC in a statement that medics know that some women find screenings \"very worrying and uncomfortable\".",
      "She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago.",
      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",
      "Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware.",
      "Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for.",
      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:21:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The gene therapy Casgevy, which will now be offered to some patients in England, could help people live disease-free, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease, with a price tag of \u00a31.65m, is to be offered to patients on the NHS in England.",
      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",
      "When she was younger she was in and out of hospital three to four times a year with painful sickle cell crises.",
      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "How many people still smoke in the UK?",
      "In June 2018, then-health minister Steve Brine wrote to the company that makes iQos, Philip Morris International (PMI), to say advertising for it was \"prohibited\" and to ask them to \"desist from such promotion in the future\".",
      "Two months later, he wrote to thank them for \"agreeing to comply with our request to stop advertising and promoting the iQos device\".",
      "PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"",
      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",
      "Both supermarkets say they do not sell the devices to children.",

      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said supermarkets advertising these products was \"disgraceful behaviour\".",
      "\"[It] puts pressure on overstretched enforcement services and risks introducing children and young people to new tobacco products.\"",

      "A spokesperson said: \"This government's landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill will enhance existing legislation, including on advertising, and put us on track for a smoke-free UK.\"",
      "The forthcoming bill is expected to ban all advertising of nicotine and tobacco products including nicotine pouches and vapes.",

    "story": [
      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) said that there are 800 arrests each month relating to threats posed to children online. It said 840,000 adults are a threat to children nationwide - both online and offline - which makes up 1.6% of the adult population.",
      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",
      "Some experts, however, believe the government could have gone further.",
      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",
      "Lynn Perry, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, welcomed government action to tackle AI-produced CSAM \"which normalises the abuse of children, putting more of them at risk, both on and offline\".",

      "\"Tech companies must make sure their platforms are safe for children. They need to take action to introduce stronger safeguards, and Ofcom must ensure that the Online Safety Act is implemented effectively and robustly.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Sir Keir Starmer was preparing to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, his campaign director told the future prime minister what mattered to the party.",
      "Morgan McSweeney emphasised that whatever their faction, Labour members shared certain core principles - and top of the list was a commitment to combatting poverty and defending the welfare state.",
      "That is why any Labour politician treads carefully when looking at welfare reform.",
      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",
      "What did that mean?",
      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",
      "\"Lots of people tell us they're scared to go to work in case it doesn't work out and they then can't go back to the safety net,\" a senior government source said.",

      "Labour says it will cut benefits bill in its own way",
      "DWP must focus on work not welfare, says minister",
      "Some in government say this may need more frequent assessments of claimants' health, but those involved in discussions acknowledge that being required to explain their condition to the DWP can often be \"traumatic\", \"humiliating\" and \"terrifying\" for vulnerable claimants.",
      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",
      "Jon Ashworth, a former shadow cabinet minister who is still close to top party figures, urged the government to put \"helping people move into good, well-paid jobs\" at the heart of their arguments for reform.",
      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",
      "\"Of course I'm worried about the politics of this,\" one minister said.",

      "The Home Office has announced an extra \u00a3100m for neighbourhood policing in England and Wales, as part of its pledge to put more officers on the ground by 2029.",
      "It comes on top of an initial \u00a3100m announced in December, when the government made recruiting an extra 13,000 officers into neighbourhood roles one of its central pledges.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"Restoring local policing will not happen overnight, but this funding boost will get more officers into our town centres and rural areas.\"",
      "However, several forces have warned that existing funding levels mean they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year.",
      "Last year, when the first tranche of money was announced, the National Police Chiefs Council said forces faced an estimated gap of \u00a31.3bn in their overall finances over the next two years.",
      "On Thursday evening, Lincolnshire Police announced that it has cancelled its upcoming intake of new police officers due to financial challenges.",

      "But senior police sources have criticised the lack of detail in the government's plans and are questioning whether the money will go into plugging existing gaps rather than recruiting extra officers.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, a senior police source said that forces had not had any details as to how they could spend the first \u00a3100m announced in December.",
      "He asked whether the money was for new PCs or PCSOs, whether it could be used to plug existing funding gaps, and how items like uniforms and cars would be paid for.",
      "PCSOs are paid employees but only share some of the powers that police officers have.",
      "They can hand out fixed-penalty notices and take alcohol from a person under the age of 18, but must ask a police officer to arrest someone.",
      "Policing Minister Dame Dianna Johnson has said the increase in funding would \"allow police forces to kick start\" the recruiting process.",
      "Asked on the Today programme about forces making cuts, Dame Diana said she wouldn't \"pretend it's not challenging for police forces\" but overall an \"extra \u00a31.1bn was going\" into policing.",
      "The money will come alongside a major police shake-up in spring. Forces will be asked to work together more and cut waste, like merging IT systems, Dame Diana said.",
      "\"We recognise that the current way policing is structured is not the most efficient or best way of providing a police service in England and Wales,\" Dame Diana said.",

      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government would \"reflect carefully\" on the court's decision but that he had not yet been able to analyse it \"in detail\".",
      "He told reporters the judgement highlighted the significance of climate implications being considered in any consenting decisions. He said that had always been an \"essential part\" of the Scottish government's stance.",

      "\"Rosebank is critical for the UK's economic growth,\" a spokesperson said, adding that it was investing \u00a32.2bn in the project and a pause would have meant job losses and a cut in tax income for the Treasury.",
      "In court, counsel for Shell had argued that quashing consent could threaten the overall viability of Jackdaw, not just costing the company and its partners huge sums of money but also impacting UK energy security, the transition to renewable energy and the wider economy.",
      "However, Lord Ericht concluded that these were not matters for him, writing: \"The question for me is not whether the projects should go ahead, but whether the unlawful decisions should be retaken in a lawful manner.\"",
      "He also rejected arguments from the companies that they had acted in good faith because the UK government had told them there was no need to include downstream emissions in their environmental assessments.",

      "The platform is currently in a fabrication yard at Verdal near Trondheim, Norway and is due to be lifted onto a barge and towed into place in the next few months.",
      "BBC News visited the yard earlier this month and witnessed engineers making final adjustments to a vast and complex array of shining pipes, valves and dials.",
      "On a misty and mild winter's day, the platform loomed up beneath a giant red and white crane, boasting a gleaming aluminium helipad and a bright orange lifeboat.",
      "The structure to support the platform, known as a jacket, is already on the seabed 150 miles east of Aberdeen.",
      "Several Norwegians we spoke to on our brief visit to Verdal, some 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle, said the weather was remarkably warm for January.",
      "This would be no surprise to climate scientists who have pointed out that Norway is home to some of the fastest-warming places on earth.",
      "In court last year, Shell's lawyer, Christine O'Neill KC, said the company accepted that greenhouse gas emissions contributed to climate change and urgent action was needed to tackle it.",
      "However, she added, \"whether, how and to what extent\" any individual project contributed to climate change was \"a complex one.\"",
      "In his judgment, Lord Ericht wrote: \"The effect of the burning of fossil fuels on climate change and the lives of individual persons is now well recognised in law.\"",
      "The judge has now, in effect, batted the case out of the judicial arena and into the wilds of politics, where the landscape has shifted even in the two months since verbal arguments in the case were heard in Edinburgh.",

      "There has been speculation that Ed Miliband is uncomfortable with this position but he has not broken ranks.",
      "On the other hand, the oil industry says it is already facing difficult conditions because of political uncertainty and high levels of taxation, with the US firm Apache recently announcing it would leave the North Sea by the end of 2029.",
      "Given that backdrop, Shell is now understood to be pressing government in private for assurances about Jackdaw.",
      "\"The addition of downstream emissions will add to the assessment process a new and significant factor which was not included on the previous assessment and may change the result of the assessment,\" wrote Lord Ericht.",

    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",

      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",

      "Many of those Labour MPs most in favour of what the chancellor has said in her speech on economic growth are part of the Labour Growth Group, a new alliance formed last year to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects and housebuilding as fast as possible.",
      "MP Chris Curtis, the group's co-chair, told the BBC: \"Anyone worrying about the opposition the Chancellor will face should know there's more than 100 MPs in the Labour Growth Group who are ready to back her every step of the way in bringing this bold vision to life.\"",

His instant restatement of his opposition to the scheme  - because of its \"severe impact\" on noise, air pollution and climate change  - may well embolden Labour critics in the House of Commons, including within the government.",

      "Opponents of the runway insist the generational split will prove to be the other way round, citing the concerns of young voters about the environment.",
      "Of course, Heathrow was not the only meaty part of the chancellor's speech. There is some private unease among Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the projects are mostly, but not all, located in the south.",
      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",

      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",
      "One Labour adviser said: \"We need to do what we did today, but that's not about winning the next election. For that we need to give the voters we need to keep what they want and need.\""

      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 01:04:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The breeds show different reaction to clocks going back and forward, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",
      "\"But we didn't really find that in pet dogs in our study.\"",
      "The team carried out their research in 2021, when Covid lockdown restrictions were in place in Canada. So they advertised for pet-owning participants, who had huskies or malamutes, to join their study remotely.",
      "\"They were amazing,\" recalled Li. \"They'd ask us questions, put the trackers we sent them by post on their dogs' [collars], most of them kept really good notes.\"",
      "The researchers say their \"takeaway finding\" is that, for working dogs, gradually easing into a timetable change might be beneficial.",
      "Because, while you can teach an old dog a new routine, such an abrupt, overnight shift can be unsettling. Unless, of course, you Are a pet with no work demands and a particularly comfortable dog bed."

    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",

      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",

      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "summary": "Tomohiko Sho says the unreleased game was something fans were 'starting to get a bit bored of'.",
    "story": [
      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",
      "\"If there is a chance, I'd definitely love to take on the challenge,\" he said."

      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",

      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse.

      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

    "story": [
      "A few hours after President Donald Trump announced that he would impose steep tariffs on Canada, hockey fans in the capital Ottawa booed the Star-Spangled Banner during a National Hockey League game against a visiting US team.",
      "On Sunday, during a National Basketball Association game between the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers, it happened again, continuing throughout the song and almost drowning out the 15-year-old's singer's arena performance.",
      "The vocal displeasure from usually respectful fans is a clear sign of Canadians' deep dismay at Trump's move to hit its nearest ally with punitive taxes, which threaten to spark an unprecedented trade war on the North American continent.",
      "The 25% tariffs imposed by Trump on all Canadian imports into the US - with a lower 10% levy on energy - are set to take effect on Tuesday.",
      "And they come as President Trump doubles down on his push - no longer dismissed as a joke - for Canada to join America and become the 51st state.",
      "While many economists project the tariffs will also drive up costs for Americans on everyday essentials, from gas to groceries, Canada is the more exposed trade partner. If they last for months, the country could tip into a painful economic recession.",
      "Anger is building - and with it, a desire to mount a fightback that has been echoed by political leaders in the country of 40 million.",
      "\"Many among us will be affected by this, and we will have some hard times. I ask you to be there for each other,\" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a Saturday evening address. \"Now is the time to choose Canada.\"",
      "Some Canadians have already heeded the calls for solidarity. On social media, guides have circulated on how to avoid American-made products. One local grocery store in Toronto even began labelling its Canadian yogurt for shoppers, according to an image posted by Toronto doctor Iris Gorfinkel on X.",
      "Others have stated they will be cancelling travel plans to the US, or forgoing visiting there altogether.",
      "\"Yesterday, in response to Trump tariffs, we cancelled our family March break to the US,\" wrote Seth Klein, a Canadian author, on Bluesky on Sunday. \"Took a small hit on cancelled train tickets, but it needed to be done.\"",
      "In some Canadian provinces - namely Ontario, the largest by population - American booze will be pulled off the shelves indefinitely starting on Tuesday.",
      "This is in addition to a total of C$155bn ($105bn; \u00a386bn) of American goods that Canada has said it will tariff in retaliation, including vegetables, clothing, sports equipment, perfume and other items. Goods originating from Republican-led states, like Florida orange juice, are specifically being targeted.",
      "The US imports more of its oil from Canada than any other country, and Trudeau's government has signalled \"all options remain on the table\" for further retaliation.",
      "A 'destabilising' moment for Canada",
      "Trump's follow-through on his threat of steep tariffs - which were long speculated to be a negotiation tactic to get concessions on border security - have bewildered Canadians, who have enjoyed close economic, social and security ties to the US for decades.",
      "\"It's a shock,\" Michael Ignatieff, the former leader of Canada's Liberal Party, told the BBC.",
      "\"We're into a new world, in which the question on whether you can trust America becomes the fundamental question in foreign policy for every country.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's opposition Conservative Party, called the tariffs on Sunday \"massive, unjust and unjustified.\"",
      "\"Canada is the United States' closest neighbour, greatest ally and best friend,\" he  said, noting that Canada fought alongside the US in two world wars, as well as in Korea and Afghanistan. \"There is no justification whatsoever for this treatment.\"",
      "Prime Minister Trudeau questioned in his Saturday address why the US would target Canada instead of looking to \"more challenging parts\" of the world.",
      "A portion of his speech was directly addressed to Americans, and he too, pointed to a history of shared bloodshed. \"We have fought, and died, alongside you,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa with a focus on national security, told the BBC that Trump's tariffs \"undoubtedly represent an earthquake in Canada-US relations.\"",
      "\"This is extremely destabilising for Canada,\" Prof Juneau said. \"As a country, we have massively benefited from our extremely close trade and security partnership with the US for decades.\"",
      "While the trade battle would likely force Canada to look for partners elsewhere, it ultimately can't escape geography, he said. It will remain reliant on the economic superpower next door.",
      "\"That is why Canada must absolutely now focus on salvaging the relationship as much as possible,\" Prof Juneau said.",
      "An unclear, costly fight ahead",
      "The big unknown remains how long the US will keep the tariffs in place, and what steps Canada could take to appease the Trump administration, which has said it expects action on cross-border fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "TD Economics projects that the longer the tariffs remain in place, the worse the impact will be. Canada could enter a recession in five to six months, and its unemployment rate could hit more than 7%.",
      "Theo Argitis, managing director of the Ottawa-based public affairs firm Compass Rose Group, said the unknowns had left Canada no choice \"but to hit (Trump) back hard.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we don't even really know why he's doing this,\" Mr Argitis told the BBC.",
      "Trump says the flow of fentanyl, a highly potent and deadly drug, into the US from Canada and Mexico, is one key reason. US officials say the levies will remain in place \"until the crisis is alleviated.\"",
      "In response, the Canadian government has noted that less than 1% of fentanyl and illegal border crossings into the US come from Canada. It has offered to spend an additional C$1.3bn to secure the US-Canada border",
      "But Trump has also spoken publicly about his frustration with the trade deficit between Canada and the US, and more broadly his view that tariffs could be a source of revenue for Washington's coffers.",
      "On Sunday, he wrote on Truth Social that the US does not need Canadian products, and said the US pays \"hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize Canada.\"",
      "\"Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable country,\" Trump wrote, before repeating his view that Canada should instead become a US state.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 23:13:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited the country amid US threats to retake control of the Panama Canal.",
    "story": [
      "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has demanded that Panama make \"immediate changes\" to what he calls the \"influence and control\" of China over the Panama Canal.",
      "America's top diplomat said Panama must act or the US would take necessary measures to protect its rights under a treaty between the two countries.",
      "The warning follows President Donald Trump's vow to retake the canal and a meeting between Rubio and Jose Raul Mulino, Panama's conservative president, in Panama City on Sunday.",
      "The two men appeared to emerge from their two-hour meeting with different interpretations.",
      "Mulino told reporters he did not see a serious threat of US military force to seize the canal, saying he had proposed technical-level talks with the US to address Mr Trump's concerns about Chinese influence.",
      "However, Trump's vow to retake the canal has sparked a significant backlash in Panama. Protesters in Panama City on Friday burned effigies of Trump and Rubio.",
      "Riot police moved in on another crowd of demonstrators, firing tear gas and wrestling people away. The clashes were small-scale, but the resistance to the US president's stance is widely felt.",
      "On Thursday, Mulino said the issue of the canal's ownership would not be up for discussion with Rubio.",
      "\"I cannot negotiate or even open a negotiation process about the canal. It's sealed, the canal belongs to Panama,\" he said.",
      "Mr Trump's comments about the canal included an unfounded claim that Chinese soldiers are operating it. He also said American ships were unfairly charged more than others, despite the fact such a practice would be unlawful under treaty agreements.",
      "The waterway is in fact owned and operated by the Panamanian government, under a neutrality treaty signed with the US decades ago. However, Chinese companies have invested heavily in ports and terminals near the canal. A Hong Kong based company runs two of the five ports close to its entrances.",
      "But President Trump's muscular approach - even refusing to rule out military action to take the canal - has aroused a strongly patriotic reaction in the small strategic nation.",
      "\"It's ridiculous,\" says Panama City resident Mari, who asked not to have her surname published.",
      "\"There's a treaty that he has to respect, and there's nothing in the treaty that says that we cannot have ports run by the Chinese,\" she told the BBC, pointing out that there is Chinese investment in American ports and cities.",
      "Surrounded by tourists and stalls hawking Panama hats and souvenirs, Mari explained that many residents have strong memories of US control of the canal and don't want to go back.",
      "The US and Panama signed a treaty in 1979, starting a handover process that saw Panama take full control of the canal in 1999.",
      "\"We could not cross into the canal zone without being arrested if we didn't follow all the American rules. The minute you stepped across that border, you were in the United States,\" Mari said.",
      "\"We had no rights within our own country, and we will not put up with that again\u2026 We are very insulted by [Trump's] words.\"",
      "For some, Trump's refusal to rule out the use of military force has also triggered suspicion and fear. It evokes memories of the 1989 US invasion of Panama to depose de facto ruler General Manuel Noriega, a conflict that lasted several weeks and rapidly overwhelmed Panamanian forces.",
      "\"I was the political leader of the opposition when Noriega said he was going to kill all the leaders of the opposition if the US were to invade,\" recalled former Panama congressman Edwin Cabrera, speaking to the BBC by the locks of the canal's Pacific entrance.",
      "\"I heard the bombs and started seeing people dying\u2026 The only thing President Trump and Rubio have left to say is that they will invade us,\" he told the BBC. \"I wouldn't like to live that again in the 21st Century, relive the imperial experience. Panama is in the middle of war between two powers, the USA and China, while we are looking at the sky.\"",
      "Marco Rubio is the first Hispanic Secretary of State and is well known for his hawkish positions on some leaders in the region and on China. While Panama closely co-operates with the US on many issues, Mr Rubio's visit is meant to signal the administration's intolerance of countries soaking up Chinese investment in what the US sees as its own backyard.",
      "In Panama, he claims China could ultimately use its interests at the ports to block US merchant or war ships in the event of a conflict or trade war.",
      "\"If China wanted to obstruct traffic in the Panama Canal, they could. That's a fact\u2026 That's what President Trump is raising and we're going to address that topic\u2026 That dynamic cannot continue,\" Mr Rubio said on The Megyn Kelly Show last week.",
      "Despite the overwhelming support among ordinary Panamanians for their country's ownership of the canal, some remain sceptical of their own leadership, arguing profits from the waterway don't filter through to enough ordinary Panamanians.",
      "\"What you see here - that the United States and Donald Trump want to take back the canal - that's what we call cause and effect,\" says Andre Howell, a hotel worker in the historic centre of Panama City.",

    "summary": "Luis Rubiales is standing trial for kissing football player Jenni Hermoso without her consent after her team won the World Cup.",
    "story": [
      "The former president of Spain's football federation, Luis Rubiales, goes on trial on Monday, accused of sexual assault for kissing the player Jenni Hermoso, in a case which has fed into wider discussions about sexism and consent.",
      "Hermoso is scheduled to appear as a witness on the opening day having travelled from Mexico, where she plays club football. The trial runs until 19 February.",
      "As Spain's players received their medals after defeating England in Sydney to win the 2023 World Cup, Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips. Afterwards, Hermoso said the kiss had not been consensual, while Rubiales insisted it had been.",
      "The incident triggered protests and calls for Rubiales's resignation, and it also entered the political arena. Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, whose left-wing government has approved reforms seeking to boost gender equality and ensure consent in sexual relations, said that Rubiales's kiss had shown that \"there is still a long way to go when it comes to equality and respect between women and men\".",
      "After initially remaining defiant and denouncing a witch-hunt driven by \"fake feminism\", the federation president eventually resigned, before legal charges were brought against him.",
      "Prosecutors are calling for Rubiales to receive a one-year prison sentence for sexual assault for the kiss. They are also calling for him to be given a sentence of a year-and-a-half for coercion, for allegedly trying to pressure Hermoso into saying publicly that the kiss was consensual. Rubiales denies the charges.",
      "Three colleagues of Rubiales are also on trial, accused of colluding in the alleged coercion: Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rub\u00e9n Rivera, the federation's former head of marketing, and former sporting director, Albert Luque. They all deny the charges.",
      "Isabel Fuentes has watched the female national team closely ever since she was among the first women to represent Spain at football, from 1971 onwards. She describes the furore caused by the Rubiales kiss as \"very sad\", because of how it overshadowed the World Cup victory, which, when mentioned, brings her to the verge of tears.",
      "\"It was something we would have liked to experience, but we weren't allowed to,\" she says. \"These players won it for us. They have lived out our dreams.\"",
      "Fuentes played when the dictatorship of Francisco Franco was still in place and the women's team were not even allowed to wear the Spanish flag on their shirts.",
      "\"The regime said: 'We don't want you to play football, but we'll just ignore you,'\" she says. \"And the federation put all manner of obstacles in our way.\"",
      "Like many fans, she was concerned by how the Rubiales controversy affected the international image of Spanish football and she was also shocked by footage showing the former federation president celebrating the World Cup win by grabbing his crotch as he stood just a few feet away from Spain's Queen Letizia.",
      "But younger players, like Bel\u00e9n Peralta, prefer to emphasise how far women's football has come, rather than dwell on the Rubiales case. Playing for third-division side Olimpia Las Rozas, Peralta says that even in the last few years she has noticed a shift in terms of the attention and support that women's football receives.",
      "\"When I was younger, girls playing football was kind of strange, you were told,  'Oh, that's for boys,' or 'That's not a girl's thing,'\" she says. \"And nowadays, you go to some places and you say, 'I'm a footballer,' and that's so cool and attractive.\"",
      "Her teammate, Andrea Rodr\u00edguez, agrees. Although she says that occasionally she might hear sexist comments about women's football, social attitudes are overwhelmingly positive.",

    "title": "Bill Gates has given away billions, but 'still has more to give'",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "The plan had been to unveil the $100bn figure in May, for the Foundation's 25th anniversary. But Gates revealed it exclusively to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Joel Le Scouarnec is accused of having abused hundreds of young patients, often while they were under anaesthetic.",
    "story": [
      "A former surgeon who is accused of abusing hundreds of young patients, often while they were under anaesthetic, is set to go on trial this month in the largest child abuse trial in French history.",
      "Joel Le Scouarnec, 73, is accused of assaulting or raping 299 children \u2013 the majority former patients of his \u2013 between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany.",
      "He has admitted to some charges, but not all.",
      "The trial in Vannes, north- west France, follows a painstaking police investigation lasting several years.",
      "It is likely to raise uncomfortable questions over whether Le Scouarnec was protected by his colleagues and the management of the hospitals that employed him, despite an FBI warning to the French authorities that he had been consulting child abuse websites, after which he was given only a suspended sentence.",
      "A staggering number of opportunities to stop the former surgeon from having contact with children appear to have been missed or rejected.",
      "Members of his own family also knew of Le Scouarnec's paedophilia but failed to stop him, it is claimed.",
      "\"It was the family's omert\u00e0 which meant his abuse was allowed to continue for decades,\" one lawyer involved in the case told the BBC.",
      "Le Scouarnec, once a respected small-town surgeon, has been in jail since 2017, when he was arrested on suspicion of raping his nieces, now in their 30s, as well as a six-year-old girl and a young patient. In 2020 he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.",
      "After his arrest, police searched his home and found child-sized sex dolls, more than 300,000 child abuse images, and thousands of pages of meticulously compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over 25 years.",
      "He has denied assaulting or raping children, arguing that his diaries merely detailed his \"fantasies\".",
      "In several instances, however, he had also written: \"I am a paedophile\".",
      "Le Scouarnec is facing more than 100 rape charges and more than 150 charges of sexual assault.",
      "Some of his former patients, who are all now adults, have said they remember the surgeon touching them under the guise of medical examinations, sometimes even when their parents or other doctors were in the room.",
      "But because a huge number of his alleged victims were under the effect of anaesthetics when it is claimed the assaults took place, they had no recollection of the events and were shocked to be contacted by police and told their names \u2013 alongside graphic descriptions of abuse \u2013 allegedly appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.",
      "Le Scouarnec felt \"all-powerful\" and liked the feeling of \"flirting with danger\" through \"calculated transgressions,\" French daily Le Monde quoted the court order against the former surgeon as saying.",
      "Some of the alleged victims have said the unsettling revelations helped them make sense of unexplained symptoms of trauma that had burdened them their whole lives.",
      "France's elite confronted by sexual abuse scandals",
      "French clergy abused 216,000 children since 1950",
      "'My father should die in prison', daughter of Dominique Pelicot tells BBC",
      "Lawyer Francesca Satta, who represents several alleged victims, told the BBC that among her clients are \"the families of two men who did remember, and who ended up taking their own lives.\"",
      "Olivia Mons of the France Victimes association spoke to many of the alleged victims and said several only had blurry recollections of events which they were never able to \"find the words to explain\".",
      "When the surgeon's case came to light, \"it provided them with the beginning of an explanation,\" Ms Mons said.",
      "But she added that most of the alleged victims were people who had no memories of being raped or assaulted, and who were living ordinary lives before police contacted them. \"Today, many of these people are understandably very shaken,\" Ms Mons said.",
      "One woman told French media that when police showed her an entry under her name in Le Scouarnec's diary, memories instantly flooded in. \"I had flashbacks of someone coming into my hospital room, lifting the bedsheets, saying he would check if everything had gone well,\" she said. \"He raped me.\"",
      "Margaux Castex, a lawyer for one of the alleged victims, told the BBC her client is \"traumatised that he ever gave his trust to a medical professional, and that's been hard to shake\".",
      "\"He wishes he had never been told what happened,\" Ms Castex said.",
      "Another woman called Marie, now a married mother in her mid-thirties, said that police came to her house and revealed that her name appeared in the diaries of a surgeon who was accused of child abuse.",
      "\"They read out what he had written about me and I wanted to read it back myself but it was impossible,\" she told outlet France Bleu. \"Can you imagine reading hardcore pornography and knowing that it is about you, as a child?\"",
      "Marie said she had seen mental health specialists for years because of \"issues\" she had with regards to men, and that doctors had wondered whether she had experienced childhood trauma.",
      "\"I have to believe that my memory protected me from that. But the [police] examination brought it all back to the surface - images, sensations, memories came back to me day by day,\" she said. \"Today, I feel this as if it had just happened.\"",
      "Marie added that when she was shown a photo of Le Scouarnec, \"everything came back to me... I remembered his icy gaze.\"",
      "She wondered how the surgeon had been able to commit his alleged crimes unnoticed for so long.",
      "It is a haunting question that is bound to be explored at length during the trial.",
      "'Institutional and judicial missteps'",
      "The first court proceedings heard claims that several members of Le Scouarnec's family had been aware since the mid-1980s of his disturbing behaviour towards children, but did not intervene.",
      "His ex-wife has denied knowing what her husband \u2013 and father of their three children \u2013 allegedly did until he was arrested.",
      "Le Scouarnec \u2013 a medical professional and a lover of opera and literature \u2013 had long been the pride of his middle-class family. He was a respected small town medical practitioner for many years, which may have afforded him a significant degree of protection in the workplace.",
      "\"A huge degree of dysfunction allowed Le Scouarnec to commit his deeds,\" lawyer Frederic Benoist told the BBC.",
      "Mr Benoist represents child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice), which is pressing to highlight what it calls the \"crucial institutional and judicial missteps\" which allowed Le Scouarnec to allegedly continue abusing children for decades.",
      "In the early 2000s, an FBI alert to the French authorities that Le Scouarnec had been accessing child abuse websites only resulted in a four-month suspended sentence with no obligation to follow medical or psychological treatment.",
      "Mr Benoist said prosecutors never shared this information with the medical authorities and there were no consequences for Le Scouarnec, who continued in his role as a surgeon, often operating on children and managing their aftercare.",
      "When a colleague \u2013 who already harboured suspicions against Le Scouarnec \u2013 read about the charges against him in the local press in 2006, he urged the regional medical association to take action.",
      "All but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics, which states that doctors \"must in all circumstances be trustworthy and act with integrity and devotion to duty\". No sanctions were imposed.",
      "\"We therefore have proof that all these colleagues knew, and none of them did anything,\" Mr Benoist said. \"There were many circumstances which meant he could have been stopped; he wasn't, and the consequences are tragic.\"",
      "The BBC has approached both the regional medical association and prosecutors for comment.",
      "Le Scouarnec was eventually arrested when the six-year-old victim told her parents that he had assaulted her. By then, he was living like a recluse in a large derelict home, surrounded by child-sized dolls.",
      "Moment of reckoning",
      "Ms Driguez, the nieces' lawyer, sat opposite Le Scouarnec during the 2020 trial in the south-western town of Saintes. \"His answers were cold and calculated,\" she said. \"He is extremely clever, but showed no empathy whatsoever.\"",
      "The trial uncovered more allegations of child abuse within Le Scouarnec's family, Ms Driguez said, but the former surgeon never had any particular reaction and mostly looked at the floor.",
      "At one point, the court was shown lurid videos of Le Scouarnec and his dolls. \"Everyone was watching the screen but I was watching him,\" Ms Driguez said. \"Up to that point he had always kept his gaze down. But at that moment, he looked up, staring intently at the video. His eyes were twinkling.\"",
      "As the city of Vannes prepares to host the trial, three lecture halls in a former university building nearby have been made available to accommodate the hundreds of alleged victims, their legal representatives and families. The trial starts on 24 February and is due to last until June.",
      "Whether the press and the public are allowed in will depend on all of the alleged victims giving up their right to a closed trial.",
      "Many lawyers believe the trial could be a moment of reckoning for the authorities that failed to take provisions against Le Scouarnec, as well as an important moment for the victims to voice their trauma.",
      "Ms Satta said that although many people involved in this case have no memory of what happened to them, they were still victims, adding that the former surgeon had enjoyed the \"impunity of silence\" for too long.",
      "\"The trial will be a moment for the victims to speak out,\" Mr Benoist agreed. \"It would be terrible, in my eyes, if it was held behind closed doors.\""

      "Air traffic control staffing was \"not normal\" at the time of a mid-air collision between a military helicopter and passenger plane in Washington, DC that killed 67 people, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has acknowledged.",
      "US media reported that Reagan National Airport tower was understaffed during Wednesday's crash, according to a government report.",
      "\"I'll take the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at their word that it wasn't normal,\" Duffy said when asked about reports during the FOX News Sunday programme.",
      "So far, 55 victims have been recovered from the Potomac River, with divers continuing to search for 12 more.",
      "There were 64 passengers aboard the American Airlines flight when it collided mid-air with an army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers as crew. There were no survivors.",
      "At the time of the crash, one air traffic control worker was managing helicopters and some planes from the airport, a job normally done by two people, two sources told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner.",
      "Duffy said \"that was part of the review process that we have to do\".",
      "He explained there was a \"consolidation of air traffic controllers an hour before it was supposed to happen during the time of this crash. And so was, what was the appropriateness of that?\"",
      "Duffy raised questions about whether controllers did \"appropriately direct traffic, consistent with procedures at the FAA\", as well as the elevation of the helicopter.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Board Member Todd Inman said preliminary data revealed the helicopter was flying at about 200ft (60m), CBS reported. The flight ceiling for helicopters in the area near Reagan National Airport is 200ft.",
      "Duffy also questioned the timing of its flight.",
      "\"Why would they fly a mission at nine o'clock at night through really busy air space... as opposed to flying that mission at one o'clock in the morning, when there's very little traffic\"? he asked.",
      "\"I want our military to be trained up and ready to go, but I also want air travellers to be safe as well, and there's a time and a place to do it, not at nine o'clock at night when there's heavy traffic.\"",
      "Investigators are considering a number of factors, including height, in determining the cause of the crash, but have not yet made any public conclusions, NTSB officials said on Thursday.",
      "Military officials told a news conference on Sunday said the helicopter crew was based in DC, where they flew daily missions to support senior army leadership and other government leaders.",
      "Wednesday's flight was a training mission required annually for recertification, led by two experienced pilots who had flown in the local area many times before, officials said.",
      "Duffy said the US has a chronic understaffing problem in air traffic control.",
      "US media has reported that more than 90% of air traffic control facilities in the country are operating below FAA recommended staffing levels.",
      "\"We haven't had enough air traffic controllers in America for a very long time,\" Duffy said, adding \"they are stressed out. They're tapped out. They're overworked. That's no excuse. It's just a reality of what we have in the system.\"",
      "The new transportation secretary said he was working with the FAA to train new air traffic controllers and \"has a plan that's going to come out to fix the problem, but the issue is you can't flip a switch and get air traffic controllers here tomorrow.\"",
      "As officials investigate the cause of the crash, recovery operations continue.",
      "\"We believe we're going to be able to recover all of the victims, but we don't know where they are at this point,\" DC fire chief John Donnelly said.",
      "At first light on Monday morning, the Army will begin to lift the wreckage, pausing if they recover any remains, Col Francis Pera said.",
      "\"Uniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us going,\" he added.",
      "During the operation on Sunday, a DC police diver was taken to hospital with hypothermia, but recovered.",

      "One day in the late 1970s, the bronze figure was suddenly covered in red paint.",

      "The clinking of beer bottles in filled plastic bags carried home by the Inuit to their tiny apartments \u2013 much smaller, usually, than the ones we Danes lived in \u2013 was testimony to pervasive alcoholism, one of the ills that Denmark had brought to Greenland, amid a lot that was undeniably good: modern health, good education.",

      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has, meanwhile, insisted Greenland is not for sale. \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders,\" she said. \"It's the Greenlanders themselves who have to define their future.\"",
      "So, what do the island's inhabitants want that future to look like - and if it does not involve them being part of the kingdom of Denmark, then what is the alternative?",
      "Strained ties with the Danes",
      "One poll of Greenlanders suggested only 6% of Greenlanders want their country to become part of the US, with 9% undecided and 85% against. But despite this, Frederiksen knows that the question of what Greenlanders want is a delicate one.",
      "Traditionally, Danes have viewed themselves as the world's nicest imperialists ever since they started to colonise Greenland in the 1720s.",
      "This self-image has been eroded in recent years, however, by a string of revelations about past high-handedness in dealing with the island's population.",
      "In particular, there have been reports of serious wrongs committed against Greenlanders - not in the distant past, but within living memory.",
      "This included a controversial large-scale contraceptive campaign. A joint investigation by authorities in Denmark and Greenland is examining the fitting of intrauterine devices (coils) into women of child-bearing age on the island, often without their consent or even their knowledge.",

      "He made the remark while talking to the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in an interview that dealt generally with relations between Greenland and Denmark.",
      "Also, in the 1960s and 1970s hundreds of children from the island were taken from their mothers, often on dubious grounds, to be reared by foster parents in Denmark. In some cases, this happened without the consent of the biological mothers, and in other instances, they were not informed that their ties with their children would be cut completely.",
      "This left a raw emotional wound that often was not healed decades later. Some of the adopted Greenlandic children were later able to trace their biological parents, but many others were not.",
      "A small group demanded compensation from the Danish state in the summer of 2024. If they are successful, it could pave the way for a large number of similar claims by other adoptees.",
      "Iben Mondrup, a novelist who was born in Denmark and spent her childhood in Greenland, sees the recent events as a rude wake-up call for the Danes who have been accustomed to viewing themselves as a benign influence in Greenland.",
      "\"The entire relationship has been based on a narrative that Denmark was helping Greenland, without getting anything in return,\" she says.",

      "\"It's important for a country to not be in a straitjacket,\" Nunaat continues.",
      "\"We shouldn't have to ask for permission to do anything. You know the feeling [as a child] when you have to ask your parents something and they say you can't? That's what it's like.\"",
      "And yet the word \"independence\" may not fully capture the complexity of the challenges and choices that Greenland faces, according to Poulsen.",
      "He says he doesn't like the word \"since everyone is interdependent in the modern world\".",

      "The extent to which Greenland would remain autonomous under US rule is unclear. So too is how its benefits system would work.",
      "After the proposal to buy the island, Trump has now doubled down on his rhetoric, apparently open to satisfying his territorial ambitions in the North Atlantic by military means.",
      "The visit by Donald Trump Jr and members of Trump's team added visual emphasis to the then president-elect's words but not everyone on Greenland was wowed.",
      "\"That makes us dig in our heels and say, 'Please control yourself,'\" says Janus Chemnitz Kleist, an IT manager for the Greenland government. \"Some people who might previously have had a positive attitude towards closer ties with the United States have started reconsidering.\"",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, a member of Danish parliament for the left-leaning party Inuit Ataqatigiit, has her own take on what needs to be done to pave the way for independence, in whatever form that may take.",
      "First, she argues that it is important to reverse what she describes as a mild brain drain out of Greenland. She says only 56% of young Greenlanders who are educated at universities and colleges in Denmark and other countries return upon graduation.",
      "\"That's not a very high number. It would be good if we could make it more attractive for them to return home and take up some of the positions that are important in Greenland society,\" she says.",
      "But in her view there is a broader economic issue too.",
      "\"Political and economic independence are interconnected,\" she says, \"and it's crucial that we cooperate with Denmark on the development of business in Greenland but also work with the Americans on the extraction of raw materials and the development of tourism.\"",
      "At present, the Greenland economy is heavily reliant on the so-called block grant, a subsidy paid by the Danish government that in 2024 amounted to the equivalent of around \u00a3480m a year.",
      "As this subsidy would likely disappear after independence, one of the most important challenges facing the Greenlanders is to find ways to replace it, explains Javier Arnaut, an economist at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.",
      "\"The economy is one of the main factors holding back the movement towards independence,\" he says. \"The economy is reliant on the Danish block grant, and if it disappeared, Greenland would have a large hole in the public budget that would need to be filled.",
      "\"The question is how. If the gap could be filled, for example, by increasing fiscal revenue through projects in mining with new partners, a clearer path towards economic independence could emerge.\"",
      "The welfare factor",
      "There is another question \u2013 not unimportant in a Nordic-style welfare state where a large part of the economy is under government control \u2013 of what would happen to all those health and social benefits that Greenland currently receives as a result of its relationship with Denmark.",
      "Currently, these benefits include access to treatment in Danish hospitals.",
      "Ask Greenlanders whether they want separation from Denmark, and most who say they do have a caveat - only if it does not cost them their welfare system.",
      "The question of what happens to the welfare system would be particularly acute in the event of a US takeover of Greenland given the American welfare state is not only smaller than those in the Nordic countries but of those in most other Western countries.",
      "But not everyone is convinced by suggestions that Greenland's cancer patients, for example, would suddenly have nowhere to go in case of independence. Pele Broberg, Greenland's former foreign minister and now chairman of the political party Naleraq, cites Iceland, which left the Danish kingdom in 1944 as an example.",
      "\"Iceland still sends medical patients to Denmark,\" he says. \"They still have students studying in Denmark, and vice versa. I have a hard time seeing what kind of obstacles Denmark would like to put up if we decide to leave the kingdom.",
      "\"It's rhetoric meant to scare us from having a discussion about independence,\" he argues.",
      "However, some Greenlanders believe that true independence may never be accomplished because of these very concerns. Mr Chemnitz Kleist argues: \"The kind of independence that you see in countries like Denmark or Belgium or Angola will never happen here.",
      "\"With such a small population, some of it not well educated, and with a complex welfare system which we would like to keep, we can never become independent in the way the word is usually understood.\"",
      "Trump's tactics and the case for the US",
      "All of these issues have been discussed for years, but they have suddenly attained a new sense of urgency with Trump's apparent bid for control of Greenland.",
      "But regardless of who sits in the White House, the question is whether Greenlanders would see any benefit in raising cooperation levels with the United States - and if so, to what extent?",
      "\"Greenland's national project is all about spreading out the island's dependence in order to have as many ties as possible with the outside world,\" says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies and an expert on the Arctic region.",
      "The search for Ukraine's missing - 'no one could have foreseen this nightmare'",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "It is in this context that some Greenlanders are warming to the model of a \"free association\" with either Denmark or the United States \u2013 replicating a similar loose arrangement between the United States and certain islands in the Pacific.",
      "\"The problem is that Greenland feels swallowed up by Denmark,\" says Mr Pram Gad. \"It aims to feel less constrained and less dependent on just one country. Free association is not so much about 'association' and more about 'free'. It's about having one's own sovereignty.\"",
      "Donald Trump's threat to take over Greenland may have been unexpected but with the trip to Nuuk his team were well aware there was a thread to be pulled at, that his security concerns come at a time when many Greenlanders are considering their future.",
      "\"In recent years all these stories have emerged and placed the modernisation narrative in a different light. The whole idea that Denmark was pursuing an altruistic project in Greenland has been challenged,\" says Iben Mondrup.",
      "\"The project that the Greenlanders were told was for their own good was actually not good for them after all. This gives rise to all kinds of thoughts about the status of the Greenlanders inside the Danish kingdom. It adds fuel to the criticism that has developed in Greenland in recent years about the idea of a community with Denmark.\"",
      "Norway, Iceland and Canada",
      "But if it's not only Denmark and it's not only America, who else can Greenland turn to? Surveys suggest that a majority of the island's inhabitants would like to step up cooperation with Canada and Iceland. Mr Broberg, the party chairman, likes the idea, and he throws Norway into the equation as well.",
      "\"We have more in common with Norway and Iceland than we have with Denmark,\" he says. \"All three of us have a presence in the Arctic, unlike Denmark. The only reason I leave open the possibility of a free association with Denmark after independence is it may put some Greenlanders at ease because they are used to the relationship with Denmark.\"",
      "Still, the question is: Would Canada and Iceland want to take on the task of providing the social benefits that Greenlanders covet? The answer would almost certainly be no.",
      "In this way, the future presenting itself to the Greenlanders is both exhilaratingly open and at the same time depressingly narrow.",

      "The Grammy Awards has a dedicated space for African music, but just a year after the category's introduction it is already proving contentious.",
      "The Best African Music Performance made its debut with South Africa's Tyla winning for her hit song Water, a blend of South African amapiano and Afropop.",
      "It was a move welcomed across the industry, especially by African artists.",
      "But the nominations for this year's award have raised eyebrows, especially with the inclusion of US R&B star Chris Brown.",
      "The 35-year-old has been nominated for his chart-topping single Sensational, which incorporates Afrobeats elements and features guest vocals from Nigerian artists Davido and Lojay.",
      "However, the participation of an American artist in an African music category has sparked some debate.",
      "Should non-African artists be considered in a category meant to showcase African talent?",
      "\"Music is about inclusivity. We don't want to fence people out of genres,\" Grammy CEO Harvey Mason Jr tells the BBC.",
      "\"If we start deciding who can or can't make a certain type of music, we lose the essence of creativity.\"",
      "The head of the Grammys explains that such cross-fertilisation is expected.",
      "\"We've seen it with Latin before, we've seen it with K-Pop and now you're starting to see it with Afrobeats and amapiano,\" he says.",
      "\"We like to honour all music [regardless of] where it comes from or who makes it. If it's excellent we want to celebrate it.\"",
      "Another bone of contention this year is the dominance of Afrobeats, which has its roots in Nigeria and Ghana.",
      "There is a feeling that the Grammys remain too focused on it, to the exclusion of other African music genres, despite calls for inclusivity.",
      "Nigerian music journalist Ayomide Tayo says he understands why Afrobeats is dominating this year's awards.",
      "\"I don't think Afrobeats is better,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"It's just that Afrobeats has had over three decades of exposure. We consistently pushed great music, superstars and events that have attracted the world to it,\" Lagos-based Tayo explains.",
      "Nigerians living abroad have also played a crucial role in the popularisation of Afrobeats.",
      "\"The Nigerian diaspora in England and North America is one of the key factors why Afrobeats exploded in Europe and the US,\" Tayo says.",
      "While other Africa-based music business professionals see a bright future for other African music genres, saying this year could be a one-off.",
      "For example, amapiano, a genre that in 2023 surpassed 1.4 billion streams on the music app Spotify.",
      "Raphael Benza, head of Johannesburg-based record label Vth Season, says the very name Best African Performance goes against pigeonholing.",
      "\"Coming from the home of amapiano, I would say [musicians] are doing extremely good work and I think next year you'll see amapiano artists being nominated in this category,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The Best African Music Performance category was introduced as a way to honour Africa's increasing influence on global music.",
      "When Tyla won, she beat Nigerian heavyweights like Davido and Burna Boy, establishing her place on the international stage.",
      "Since then, the 22-year-old has been spotted at the Met Gala in New York and has been featured in top fashion magazines, proving that the Grammys effect is real.",
      "This year's nominees, however, have shifted almost entirely to Nigerian artists, with Yemi Alade, Burna Boy, Tems and a joint nomination for Asake & Wizkid, as well as Davido and Lojay featuring on Chris Brown's hit.",
      "\"To be fair to Chris Brown, he has been invested in Afrobeats and African music for a long time,\" says Tayo, explaining that the US musician flew to Nigeria to collaborate with Davido and Wizkid.",
      "\"We have an inside joke in Nigeria that we say Chris Brown is Nigerian, because of the ways he pops up in our songs and our music videos all the time.\"",
      "Last month, he also held two massive sell-out concerts at a 90,000-seater stadium in Johannesburg - with people travelling from across southern Africa to see his performance, which fans said was electrifying.",
      "African musicians have won Grammys long before the Best African Music Performance Award was established.",
      "South Africa's Mariam Makeba was the first to win one - Best Folk Recording - in 1966 for her collaboration with Harry Belafonte, called simply An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba.",
      "African artists became more of a feature after 1992, with the introduction of the Best World Music Album.",
      "That category has gone through various guises over the years - including being split into traditional and contemporary world music awards - and is now known as Best Global Music Album.",
      "Multi-award winners include Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Youssou N'Dour, Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 and Ladysmith Black Mambazo.",
      "But African musicians have often broken out of that category for example, South Africa's Black Coffee won Best Dance/Electronic Album in 2022.",
      "The hope is that to counter the dominance of Afrobeats, more categories from Africa will be offered at the Grammys in years to come.",

      "It was not a bluff, the tariffs are here - and this is just the opening salvo from the Oval Office.",
      "The world trading system has not been here before. A slide towards a wider trade conflict is very much on the cards, as President Trump prepares similar tariffs firstly against Europe, and then at a lower level universally.",
      "But what matters as much as the actions the US takes, is how the rest of the world responds.",
      "That, in turn, requires a judgement about what the president is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Trump regularly changes his rationale for tariffs - either to coerce diplomatic change, to deal with trade imbalances or to raise significant revenues.",
      "These policy objectives cannot all be achieved simultaneously.",
      "For example, learning from the experience of Trump's first term \"China deal\", Western diplomats have been scrambling to find lists of US goods they might buy more of, in order to give the White House some wins.",
      "Europe could say it is increasing its purchases of US shipments of liquefied natural gas, or arms, or specialised magnets for wind farms.",
      "It doesn't really matter if these trends were already in train, as long as the US president can be allowed to chalk up a \"win\".",
      "But is changing trade deficit numbers really the aim here?",
      "Officially, the rationale for Trump's move is punishment for the trade in the synthetic opioid fentanyl, but that is widely seen as a legal pretext for \"emergency\" action that would normally require a congressional decision.",

When asked, they avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",

      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

    "summary": "There is a good chance that inside your device is some metal dug up in a mine controlled by rebels.",
    "story": [
      "There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging.",
      "It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.",
      "The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.",
      "The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal \u2013 including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.",
      "It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more \u2013 of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.",
      "The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan \u2013 the ore from which tantalum is extracted \u2013 is mined.",
      "Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.",
      "Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.",
      "Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.",
      "They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.",
      "Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a \"state-like administration\", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (\u00a320) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.",
      "It runs the area as a monopoly making sure \u2013 through the threat of arrest and detention \u2013 that only its authorised traders are able to do business.",
      "The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.",
      "There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.",
      "Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.",
      "Theoretically, a certification scheme - known as the Innovative Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics does not come from areas of conflict where it could be used to fund armed groups responsible for carrying out atrocities.",
      "The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold \u2013 so-called \"conflict minerals\" \u2013 are not inadvertently funding violence.",
      "But Itsci has come under some criticism.",
      "Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.",
      "Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.",
      "He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.",
      "\"There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves.\"",
      "Itsci did not respond to a BBC request for comment, but has in the past defended its record saying that the scheme has been subjected to a rigorous independent audit. It has also been praised for bringing \"prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners\".",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.",
      "Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.",
      "The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to \"heavy-duty trucks\" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.",
      "Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is  mixed with Rwandan production leading to a \"significant contamination of supply chains\".",
      "The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya -  setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.",
      "\"A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.",
      "In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.",
      "\"It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,\" she added.",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\".",
      "Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.",
      "In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using \"conflict minerals\".",
      "Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.",
      "Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.",

      "Hundreds of adoptions could have taken place between the 1950s and 1990s, say former members.",
      "Some of the children who were adopted within the church have told us they were then subjected to abuse and neglect in their adoptive families.",
      "The claims follow a BBC investigation last year into allegations of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, which is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide and is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos. The FBI has since launched an investigation.",
      "Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing.",
      "Four women - who were all unmarried at the time - have told us they were given no option but to give up their babies. Three of them feared being cast out of the church and sent to hell if they refused.",
      "One says she was pressured into giving her baby to a married couple in the church after she was raped in 1988, age 17.",
      "\"My fear of going to hell was so great that it forced me to make up my mind to give up the baby to this couple in the church,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Another says she wasn't allowed to see her baby daughter before the child was taken away forever.",
      "The BBC has also spoken to six people given up for adoption as babies between the 1960s and 1980s. One woman says she was physically and emotionally abused in her first adoptive family in the church, and sexually abused in the second.",
      "The adopted children - born all over the US - are referred to within the church as \"Baldwin Babies\" because the adoptions were overseen by Wally Baldwin, a doctor from the sect who died in 2004.",
      "Some of the women would stay at his home in Oregon during pregnancy, according to a minister who used to work with Dr Baldwin.",
      "The exact number of Baldwin Babies is unclear. The BBC has spoken to the late doctor's adopted son, Gary Baldwin, who said the original records were no longer available but he believed the number to be \"less than 200\".",
      "He said that \"inevitably\" mistakes were made by his father's vetting system but that his intentions were good. Others we spoke to also said they remembered Dr Baldwin fondly.",
      "Because The Truth has no official leader, the BBC instead contacted six of its most senior current officials - known as \"overseers\" - for comment. We received one response. The overseer told us any adoptions he was aware of had been done \"through legal channels\" and he had \"heard some beautiful stories\".",
      "One woman who was adopted recalled seeing hundreds of photos in an album Dr Baldwin would keep of the children whose adoptions he had organised in The Truth.",

      "\"Somewhere the church got off track and it became a fear-based cult and I was forced to make a choice,\" says Melanie Williams, 62, who gave up her baby for adoption in January 1981.",
      "At 18, Melanie became pregnant after falling \"madly in love\" with a boy from her school.",
      "Not only were the pair unmarried, but the father was not a member of The Truth and refused to become one. This meant Melanie had committed a \"terrible sin\" in the eyes of local workers.",
      "The workers and her family decided that she could only continue to attend church meetings if she gave her baby to another family in the sect.",
      "\"If I keep this baby, I'm going to go to hell. If I keep the baby, I can't go home,\" Melanie recalls thinking.",
      "She gave birth in a Catholic hospital in Oklahoma, where she was discreetly put in a room on her own.",

      "When she eventually found out the baby was alive, she told a nurse she was wavering on whether to go through with the adoption and wanted to hold her baby.",
      "\"You can't ever hold your baby,\" came the reply.",
      "Years later, Melanie managed to track her daughter down - but she didn't want to meet.",
      "Deb Adadjo, 54, was also unsure about giving up her baby, but felt too much pressure at the time to refuse the workers, who threatened to ban her from church meetings - which in The Truth meant you not only got thrown out of the church, but also ended up in hell.",
      "She became pregnant after being raped in 1988.",
      "Recalling holding her newborn, she says - \"I can still feel her against my chest right now.\"",

      "\"We talk for like two or three hours on the phone - she's a pretty incredible woman.\"",
      "Adopted babies left open to abuse",

      "Of the six Baldwin Babies who spoke to the BBC, two faced sexual, physical and emotional abuse in their adoptive families, while one said she had been subjected to emotional abuse by her adoptive father.",
      "One woman said she was removed from her first adoptive home by social services because of extreme physical abuse and was placed in the home of a church \"elder\" - a person of seniority who holds meetings in their own home - and his wife.

    "title": "Jesse Eisenberg on the bitter and sweet of \"A Real Pain\"",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:48:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

      "An initial video clip of a rodeo-style billboard with \"COWBOY CARTER TOUR\" spelled out in lights popped up on Beyonc\u00e9's Instagram page after midnight Eastern Time, and a portrait of the singer quickly followed alongside the caption \"COWBOY CARTER TOUR 2025.\" Exact dates, ticketing and location information are still under wraps.",

    "story": [
      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",

    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

      "\"It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer, songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull,\" her spokesperson said. \"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family. She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",
      "The pop song ended up on the U.K. and American charts. Multiple hit singles and two debut albums followed.",
      "Jagger said on Thursday that he was \"so saddened to hear of the death\" of Faithfull.",
      "\"She was so much part of my life for so long,\" Jagger said on social media. \"She was a wonderful friend, a beautiful singer and a great actress. She will always be remembered.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school when her career took off. At 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby but later walked away from both her marriage and her career, for Jagger.",
      "She and Jagger began seeing each other in 1966 and became one of the most notorious couples of \"Swinging London,\" with Faithfull once declaring that if LSD \"wasn't meant to happen, it wouldn't have been invented.\"",
      "But in 1967 when Faithfull was at a party, police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home where drugs were found. The charges were later dropped, but her angelic image was disgraced.",
      "After Jagger and Faithfull broke up, she fell into drug addiction and was homeless by her mid-20s.",
      "In 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, the critically acclaimed \"Broken English.\" But Faithfull was still an addict and it would be six more years before she finally cleaned herself up.",

    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",

      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 07:07:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal officials approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid\u200b medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",

      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",
      "The FDA's decision to ease those so-called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone were the focus of a Supreme Court case last year that ended in defeat for abortion opponents.",
      "\"Walking back REMS has significantly increased safety risks for women. And so from our perspective, as directed by the administration, we do believe that an RFK HHS has the ability to direct the FDA to review safety,\" said John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life.",
      "Mize's group has petitioned the FDA \"urging the reinstatement of basic safety measures\" while additional data is collected on their risks. He cited the death of Amber Thurman in a high-profile case that made headlines last year after a medication abortion.",
      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",

      "\"This is how the sausage gets made. And you know, it's not always pretty and it isn't always what you want, but I'm really encouraged to see Bobby be pragmatic about the political realities here,\" said Malone.",
      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

    "story": [
      "The White House blamed an \"outage\" for locking out a wide range of organizations and agencies on Tuesday from the online systems responsible for drawing down federal health dollars.",
      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin health care systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "China's commerce secretary said that China would challenge the tariffs through the World Trade Organization, according to Reuters, claiming that the move \"seriously violates\" WTO rules.",
      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.

      "Three trade associations for the distilled spirits industry \u2014 Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, and Spirits Canada \u2014 said in a joint statement that they were \"deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry.\"",
      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders. These countries are now on notice to work quickly to stop the madness. This is long overdue.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter. Automobiles could see an average price increase of $3,000 each due to the tariffs, given the huge volume of cars now being built in Canada and Mexico, according to TD Economics.",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",
      "Read an excerpt below about how, in eighth grade, he discovered BASIC, which introduced him to the elegance and exacting demands of computer code; and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Bill Gates on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" February 2!",
      "\"Source Code: My Beginnings\" by Bill Gates",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "summary": "The White House levied new import duties on its three closest trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could soon be paying more for everything from automobiles to avocados after the Trump administration levied\u00a0stiff new tariffs\u00a0on the nation's three largest trading partners.",
      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 17:38:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is an avowed supporter of tariffs, but many experts say such trade measures can boost inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, imposed a\u00a0wave of new import duties\u00a0Saturday on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "On Friday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump on Saturday will imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canadian imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. She cited \"illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country\" as the reason for the tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",
      "Chopra was notified of his firing via an email from the White House, a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the Associated Press.",
      "During his term, Mr. Trump had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "An ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Chopra then was\u00a0tapped by former President Joe Biden\u00a0to lead the consumer agency that he helped launch after the 2008-09 financial crisis. He served as its deputy director, sounding the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt.",
      "Warren, one of Mr. Trump's favorite targets, said in a statement that the CFPB under Chopra held \"Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families\" and prevented \"the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.\"",
      "Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director. But he had publicly stated that he would leave his post if the new president asked.",
      "\"I hope that the CFBP will continue to be a pillar of restoring and advancing economic liberty in America, and I wish you good luck in serving our great country,\" Chopra said in his letter to Mr. Trump.",
      "Consumer Reports applauded Chopra's work at the CFBP saying he \"leaves behind an impressive track record of accomplishments for working families.\"",
      "\"Rohit Chopra has worked tirelessly at the CFPB to make sure that consumers are protected when they take out a loan, make a payment, or open a bank account,\" said Delicia Hand, Senior Director, Digital Marketplace, at Consumer Reports. \"Under Chopra's leadership, the Bureau has scored a number of big wins for consumers, securing billions of dollars in relief for those who have been cheated out of their money and establishing critical new rules to ensure they are treated fairly.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.\"",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Kennedy has since transferred ownership of the trademark application to a limited liability company managed by Del Gibtree, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.",

      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",

Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",

      "The company announced on Jan. 24 that it would end its DEI goals that were previously set to increase Black employees' representation and advancement, improve Black shoppers' experiences and promote Black-owned businesses. They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",
      "\"For decades, Target has benefitted from nearly unfettered support from Minnesota residents, families and consumers all around the country. In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",
      "\"We do not believe it is a coincidence that Target made this decision after the holiday shopping season and roughly one week before the start of Black History Month,\" said Monique Cullars-Doty, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota.",
      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",
      "The fact Target actually increased DEI efforts after George Floyd's murder is making the company's decision that much more unbelievable for people like Jaylani Hussein, spokesperson for CAIR-MN.",
      "\"If you would have told me in those summers and months to come here today, talking about Target reversing its decision, I would personally say I couldn't believe it,\" said Hussein.",
      "He speculated that Target would reverse course by the end of February. On the other side of the boycott, Black business owners like Tabitha Brown \u2014 who sells kitchenware and has had her products highlighted in Target stores under the company's previous DEI initiatives \u2014 said in an Instagram video that she understands the anger. However, she asked for those who may consider a boycott to reconsider.",
      "\"If we all decide to boycott and be like, 'No, we're not spending no money at these organizations,' so many of us will be affected and our sales would drop our business would be hurt,\" said Brown.",
      "\"We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion,\" Target said in its initial statement explaining the rollback. \"Belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.\"",
      "The decision raised questions about the future of Target's philanthropic commitments. A company spokesperson told the Associated Press that the \"recent update does not impact Target Foundation giving,\" but added that, \"as always, the foundation will continue to evaluate how it best supports organizations, coalitions and networks.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

      "A government-wide email President Trump's aides planned to send Tuesday says employees have until Feb. 6 to decide whether to participate in a \"deferred resignation program,\" which would give federal employees the ability to decide now that they will resign in September.",

They would continue to receive paychecks during regular pay periods, rather than a lump sum payout, OPM officials told CBS News.",

Another 46% were eligible to telework, and they spent an average of 61% of working hours in office. Only 10% of federal workers were in fully remote positions.",

      "\"The substantial majority of federal employees\" working remotely since the pandemic \"will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,\" the email says, adding that there were plans for \"meaningful consolidation\" that could result in office relocations for \"a number of federal workers.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its first policy meeting since President Trump's inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",

      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed held its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, a move that was forecast by a majority of economists polled by FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "The January pause marks an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed had signaled that it expected fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. Economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the rate pause by the fed.",
      "When did the Fed make its rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve announced its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29. It will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "summary": "Trump executive order that reclassifies career civil servants risks politicizing thousands of government jobs, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "The National Association of Medicaid Directors is seeking clarification on the interruption from the White House, according to a spokesperson.",
      "By Wednesday, multiple state Medicaid programs had reported that they were able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",

      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",

Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",

      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Republican attorneys general from 19 states want Costco Wholesale to ditch its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, making the call days after the retailer successfully defended its DEI policies as good for business to shareholders.",
      "In a\u00a0letter on Monday to Costco CEO Ron Vachris, the AGs accuse the retailer of \"clinging to DEI policies that courts and businesses have rejected as illegal,\" and called on it to account for the legal risks of its actions.",
      "Led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, the Republican officials instructed Costco to let them know within 30 days whether it would get rid of its DEI policies or explain why not.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The GOP letter came after Costco shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that the wholesale club operator evaluate any risks associated to its DEI practices. The shareholder behind the resolution, the National Center for Public Policy Research, argued that DEI \"may sound benign,\" but in fact is \"weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "Costco's board, however, urged against the conservative think tank's motion ahead of its annual meeting.",
      "\"Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,\" the retailer stated. Costco's \"commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information,\" it added.",
      "A day after Costco held its ground on its DEI policies, discount store chain Target joined Walmart and other corporations in scaling back on diversity initiatives under attack from conservative activists emboldened by high court decisions and President Trump, who recently banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Intended as a means of promoting fairness in the workplace and open paths for people of color, women and expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity, DEI programs gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino Sunday amid his first overseas trip, as the Trump administration makes a push for control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis and thanked President Mulino for his support of a joint repatriation program, which has reduced illegal migration through the Darien Gap,\" Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Speaking at the U.S. embassy, the secretary of state said that Panama is very important to the U.S. and thanked all the staff that serve the embassy.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In the meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump has determined that China's influence on the Panama Canal is \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which come after months of threatening to do so as he seeks to leverage trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged Sunday that there may be \"some pain\" with the tariffs in a social media post. But he argued that \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "The tariffs come in part to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as illicit drugs, into the U.S. And Rubio's first overseas visit to Central America and the Caribbean, of which Panama is the initial stop, also comes as the Trump administration seeks cooperation on its immigration policy from nearby countries, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, criticized the president's move on Sunday, saying in an appearance on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the tariffs are \"going to end up costing consumers,\" with increased prices on goods from avocados and beer to cars and trucks.",

      "FBI supervisors across the country have received questionnaires to distribute to certain agents in their field offices containing questions about the agents' possible work on Jan 6. Capitol riot cases, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News the questionnaires are being sent to more than 1,000 FBI agents and non-agent support personnel in field offices across the country, as well as FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "The questions, obtained by CBS News, ask what role the respondent may have played in any cases, such as acting as an agent, providing management support or collecting online data. The survey also asks if the respondent made any arrests, conducted interviews, participated in search warrants, testified in court or appeared before a grand jury.",
      "The questionnaires are to be completed and submitted by supervisors by Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The questionnaire comes days after Washington, D.C.'s top prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, was directed to fire prosecutors who were assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a memo obtained by CBS News. A separate memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered that all FBI agents who were assigned to the Jan. 6 insurrection cases undergo review.",
      "Bove on Friday ordered the acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack investigation for review \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In a note to members regarding the questionnaire, the FBI Agents Association said,\u00a0\"We understand that this feels like agents and employees are being targeted, despite repeated assurances that 'all FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,'\" although it was not immediately clear who had provided such assurances. \"Employees carrying out their duties to investigate allegations of criminal activity with integrity and within the rule of law should never be treated as those who have engaged in actual misconduct,\" the note added.",
      "James Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, said in a memo to 1,200 agents and support personnel on Friday, \"Today we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.\"",

      "\"As part of what is being offered to you right now, my only ask of you is that you do the homework, gather all the information, and talk it through with your loved ones before you make an informed decision.\"",
      "He called Driscoll and acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane \"total warriors\" and concluded the memo saying, \"I mourn the forced retirements of the [executive assistant directors] and fired field office heads, all of whom are extraordinary individuals who have dedicated decades of their lives to this joint just to be robbed of their title and profession but not their dignity.\""

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you \u2013 and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents.",
      "I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment.",
      "I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No.",
      "I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo.",
      "Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example \u2013 down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution.",
      "And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs.",
      "He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term.",
      "The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was \u2013 President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking.",
      "And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well.",
      "That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid.",
      "These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador.",
      "Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars.",
      "And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 when it should be the American worker's dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which is a \u2013 separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell \u2013 yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going.",
      "Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently.",
      "And let's make another point on this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress \u2013 Congress authorizes and earmarks funding.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars \u2013 most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure.",
      "I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say \u2013 this is a little bit hyperbole \u2013 but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad.",
      "That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea.",
      "I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done.",
      "It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about \u2013 you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 efficiencies in aids versus restructuring.",
      "So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID.",
      "As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground.",
      "The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened.",
      "So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement.",
      "So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it.",
      "That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker.",
      "That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put \u2013 that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China.",
      "That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations.",
      "But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee.",
      "The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility \u2013 disability. Excuse me.",
      "The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it.",
      "Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal \u2013 a personal aircraft.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft.",
      "To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe.",
      "But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well.",
      "And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: \u2026 not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator \u2013 Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it.",
      "Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",
      "Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break.",
      "I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week.",
      "Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time.",
      "One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many.",
      "But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine?",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy.",
      "But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower.",
      "And, by the way, it's not just health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up.",
      "Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week.",
      "We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane.",
      "And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out?",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of \"The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence\"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out.",
      "Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide.",
      "What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity.",
      "Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions.",
      "Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do.",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, \"line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do.\"",
      "Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings.",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here.",
      "But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements.",
      "Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him.",

We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 18:14:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The Temporary Protected Status designation has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is terminating an immigration program that currently protects hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. from deportation, paving the way for many of them to lose their legal status this spring, according to a government notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this weekend revoked one of two Temporary Protected Status designations for Venezuela, which the U.S. government had previously determined was too dangerous to allow Venezuelans to return to their homeland safely.",
      "Created in 1990, TPS has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from nations beset by war, environmental disasters or other emergencies that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The policy shields beneficiaries from deportation and makes them eligible for work permits but it does not give them permanent legal status.",
      "The Venezuela TPS program is by far the biggest of its kind, protecting more than 600,000 migrants from deportation, government statistics show.",
      "The move by the Trump administration will mean that an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans\u00a0covered under a 2023 TPS designation will lose their work permits and deportation protections two months after Noem's decision is officially published. Venezuelans enrolled in TPS under an earlier 2021 designation will continue to have that status through September, though those protections could also be phased out.",
      "Those whose TPS protections lapse and lack another immigration status will lose their ability to work in the U.S. legally and become vulnerable to being detained and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has dramatically increased arrests across the country under President Trump. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said the Venezuelan government had agreed to accept migrant deportees from the U.S., after rejecting American deportation flights for years.",
      "The efforts to scale back TPS, first reported by The New York Times,\u00a0echo a broader crackdown by Mr. Trump on illegal immigration and humanitarian programs that allowed some migrants to come or stay in the U.S. legally. Administration officials have also drafted plans to revoke the legal status of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. under a sponsorship process established by the Biden administration.",
      "Venezuelan migrants were first granted TPS in 2021 by the Biden administration, which cited the deteriorating economic and political conditions in Venezuela under the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Nearly 8 million people have left Venezuela as part of the largest exodus recorded in the Western Hemisphere, according to the United Nations. While millions of Venezuelans have settled in other South American countries like Colombia, hundreds of thousands traveled to the U.S. southern border during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "While Noem acknowledged in her decision that some conditions in Venezuela cited by the Biden administration \"continue,\" she determined it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the TPS program. She cited challenges some communities in the U.S. have faced in absorbing migrants in recent years and the arrival of members of the Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua.",
      "Noem also suggested policies like TPS encourage illegal immigration, saying extensions of the policy could amount to \"pull factors\" that attract people to the U.S. border.",
      "Biden extended TPS protections to a record number of people, offering them to hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Ukraine and other countries in turmoil. It also reversed the first Trump administration's attempts to terminate TPS programs for several countries, including El Salvador.",
      "Trump officials and many Republican lawmakers believe the TPS policy has been abused and improperly extended too often, despite the program's temporary nature. In one of his first executive orders, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to ensure TPS is \"limited in scope.\"",
      "Still, a handful of Republican lawmakers had urged Mr. Trump to protect Venezuelans from deportation. In a letter Friday, Florida GOP Congressman Carlos Gimenez called on the Trump administration to offer Venezuelan TPS holders a \"solution,\" saying that most are law-abiding migrants \"seeking freedom.\"",

      "SEN. SANDERS: --than other wealthy countries. And if you're working class in this country, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward in saying he cannot- he believes- continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that. When he has other conspiracy theories- when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, you've got to guarantee health care to all people. He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So I was not particularly happy with his presentation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it. According to the CDC, there is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen.",
      "[SEN. BILL CASSIDY SOT]",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism. That would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senator seemed to be saying, If you want my vote, answer the question you said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, look I don't want to- I- Margaret, what I'm saying is I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy, but I got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president, it's not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind them. By the way, anybody, any working person in this country, should understand what that means. It means that you can have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country, but the movement toward authoritarianism. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No- No, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like what you are saying is that someone at the top of the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why won't you say that's disqualifying for him?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Because I have not said- I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I vote, but let me just tell you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. That's why I'm asking you.",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, I know they hope for a lot of things that just may not happen. But I think- go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You got to take on the insurance companies. Got to move to Medicare for All, got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is low. And by the way, it's not just health care. It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their lifespans, but their well being. Those are issues we've got to address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign then candidate Trump and Vance, they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions. They don't want to tax tips. They want child care tax credits. They're pro-worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies? And if so, where?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I got to tell you, just last week, what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means if you are a worker right now- and there are millions of workers who want to join a union, because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits, what they have done is neuter that. So right now, union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now seven and a quarter an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to make a decision\u2013",
      "SEN. SANDERS: --That- that ain't going to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believes they have too much power in big tech and that he says they're still very much on notice. In regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on?",
      "SEN. SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job, and if Vance wants to work with us on that. He's right. You have right now, not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely, I do, and we'd be happy to work with them if they're serious about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, Independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back.",

      "REP. BRIAN MAST: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on- on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there is a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada?",
      "REP. MAST: Yeah, and he was- President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order outline, that it's specifically related to fentanyl, it's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust but verify situation that has to- goes on--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Through Canada--",
      "REP. MAST: --go on here- through Canada as well. Absolutely. Fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the- the coming up- months and years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement? The treaty?",
      "REP. MAST: The- the violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things, so--",
      "REP. MAST: --it's been taken for granted, and I will make sure, certainly, as the Foreign Affairs Chairman, that we give every single authority, as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid, these are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America, and we're going to support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there?",
      "REP. MAST: Please do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly?",
      "REP. MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy, in many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --What proof do you have of that?",
      "REP. MAST: Sure. Let's list them off. Half a million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia. $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru. $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was the priority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh it- it certainly seems like there- there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1% of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison, but--",
      "REP. MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Powers, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal, she said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid, up to 30 cents on the dollar, from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem, that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I think you're talking about--",
      "REP. MAST: --when it's the American worker's dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the- the USAID, the aid--",
      "REP. MAST: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --agency, which is a- sep- separate from the State Department currently, and has about $40 billion worth--",
      "REP. MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under- under Secretary Rubio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell- yeah, tell me about that, because that's what I- where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency?",
      "REP. MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command and control of these agencies, where again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the Secretary of State.",
      "REP. MAST: --but 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command and control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress--",
      "REP. MAST:--And let's make another point as well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Congress authorizes and earmarks funding--",
      "REP. MAST: --most of these dollars- most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70 plus percent, don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through U.S. ports, and that's another big problem for America.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So- I'm sorry, Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding. Just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the Secretary of State. Are you?",
      "REP. MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department, and having it fall under whether the other parts of the United States, Department of State, because of its failure, I just went over the numbers twice with you, in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands- I mean, you could- you could almost say, this a little bit hyperbole, but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the DC beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the- the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that- that- in the law, signed in in the 1960s, that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID. Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order?",
      "REP. MAST: So all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is, now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99% of cents on the dollar actually go--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay--",
      "REP. MAST: --towards what it's intended--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --okay, so you're talking about--",
      "REP. MAST: -- instead of people around the beltway.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're talking about--",
      "REP. MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --efficiencies and aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Like I said--",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100%. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence, you have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID Global Health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me, this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in mid air. That's what's happening. This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do.",
      "REP. MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in, or representatives like myself that do oversight, the agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally. Or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that, we're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it, and where it's actually saving life. And guess what, when they don't come explain something that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work, is the contractors have to front the cash then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordinance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all?",
      "REP. MAST:\u00a0 They will have an opportunity- it doesn't concern me, because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this, let's use PEPFAR as an example. You're talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put, that was authorized, but it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries, like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this, should we be paying for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? Should the American worker be- be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, real questions. But in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the- the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home.",
      "REP. MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility- disability, excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor, possibly, to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them? Or--",
      "REP. MAST: No, no offense. Let's- let's unpack it. Number one, I'll use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt, but flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal- personal aircraft, but to put me in charge--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an air traffic controller.",
      "REP. MAST: --of 50 or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities, and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash. Yes, there were very real errors that took place, both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax, with the big game coming next week. If you- you know, avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, price is going to go up. The question around cars- I've read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to 10,000 on trucks, because we've actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think it's well about the fact that for years, we've been encouraging businesses to leave China and near shore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours- like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is- remember Donald Trump got hired trying to lower grocery- saying he was going to lower grocery prices\u2013",

You are, as we said, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, we watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard, she had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball. But listen to what happened.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that- her refusal to call him a traitor and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information- probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard- who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden, she called him a brave whistleblower, couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that- what signal if she got in, would that send to the IC workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law if she called Snowden a brave whistleblower? And what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law that's based on trust. Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traders in recent American history as- as such, as a traitor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I know there are a number- our committee is the- historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that, as we've seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We'll know this coming week, but it's not just Snowden, it was- America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called- something we call Section 702, she left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well, her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups or echoing Putin's comments somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine, that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities- agencies",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump- he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far between the FBI and Justice Department, we've seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge. But is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation- that was a comprehensive investigation. I've been told there were almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those- that could be thousands--",
      "MARGARET BRENN: Yeah--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --what does that mean for our cyber security? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of, you know, serious crime investigations? This would be devastating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's- our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not--",
      "SEN. WARNER: --But, Margaret. Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's not clear.",
      "SEN. WARNER: We've seen- but we've seen you get your name on these lists. It's like- it's like, Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for but we had a great tragedy this week in DC with the air- the crash. We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2 or 3000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly, frankly again, without legal authority\u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to air traffic controllers?",
      "SEN. WARNER: All federal employees- my understanding it went out to two million federal employees. This offer- which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from, but it is- I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on, and we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening, and these workers are the folks that inspect our- our fruit, our milk, our eggs. You know, what happens if they all quit?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you- and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia, they are your constituents. I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee, Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State. He told a podcaster this week, the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a \"threat versus cost risk assessment.\" I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former US officials go away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. I've seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. I think this is payback and it's not just Pompeo--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But Secretary Rubio endorsed this.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Listen I have not seen any intelligence- and here I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now chair of the intel committee- we've seen nothing to indicate less threat.

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Frank Figliuzzi, former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, and CBS News Justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Feb. 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi. He is a former FBI Assistant Director for counterintelligence who joins us from Houston. Also here Is CBS News Justice Correspondent Scott McFarlane, and you cover justice and FBI, a lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from our Andy Triay\u00a0and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber-criminal divisions are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out?",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yeah, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions, so at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone, and then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington Field Office, you are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week, as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6 cases or Trump related cases. This makes America less safe. This is not reduction. This is not efficiency. It makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just to follow up there, Scott McFarlane. What Frank was referring to is the list that was requested. CBS's Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. He ordered the Acting Director of the FBI to compile everyone who is an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6 cases; there were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required and must be produced by 12pm eastern time Tuesday, according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list Margaret would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6 cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, are in the court docket. They're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible, it's a different question, whether these firings are legally permissible? It's a different question. We know the acting FBI director in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions, feels to me like there is a galvanization of FBI employees if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so it's a different question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I was asking. Is it actually going to be firings, or is this actually just going to be you can't do what the President's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering the Hill. He's a Republican from Pennsylvania. Used to be an FBI agent. Gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, \"line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned and the leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military they go with they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do.\" Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings.",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed, it's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request, and reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interestingly enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked Jan 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here, but yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases. In many cases, gained convictions and guilty pleas, and if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field, and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss, isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying, he said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to- is it credible, and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on the trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director, almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican up for reelection in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott McFarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom-lining it. We'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, said Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presentation before Senate committees last week, though he would not say how he plans to vote on Kennedy's nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, is the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before last week. The Finance Committee announced Sunday that it will vote on whether to advance RFK's nomination Tuesday.",
      "The Vermont independent outlined where he thinks Kennedy is right, pointing to his comments about the nation being unhealthy, about life expectancy relative to other wealthy countries and issues with the food industry. But he stressed that Kennedy \"continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines,\" and was not aligned with him on issues like universal healthcare and targeting the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices.",
      "Sanders also argued that \"the conspiracy theories\" that Kennedy has entertained are \"not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration.\"",
      "The comments come after Kennedy was grilled on his vaccine stance, among other things, during the hearings last week, as his advancement out of committee \u2014 and confirmation by the Senate more broadly \u2014 remains in question.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said he's been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination due to concerns he may undermine faith in vaccines. And without support from Democrats and independents on the committee, Cassidy's opposition could tank a favorable recommendation for Kennedy. In a floor vote before the full Senate, Republicans can lose just three votes to confirm Kennedy without support across the aisle.",
      "Though Kennedy, 71, dropped out of the presidential race to endorse President Trump in August, he previously sought the Democratic nomination and has close ties to the party as the as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy.",
      "Sanders, asked whether he would help Republicans to confirm Kennedy, said he will make his decision in the days ahead, noting that although he's voted for some of Mr. Trump's nominees, though he's voted against most.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to the United States for a pivotal meeting with President Trump during which they are expected to discuss \"victory over Hamas\" and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries.",
      "The meeting Tuesday at the White House will be Mr. Trump's first with a foreign leader since returning to office on Jan. 20. It comes as the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza holds and mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of the agreement.",
      "Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, \u00a0is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on Jan. 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far.",
      "The militant group has said it will not release the hostages slated to go free in the second phase without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "In a statement released ahead of his departure on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Mr. Trump would discuss \"victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,\" referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas.",
      "He said that that by working together, they could \"strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.\"",
      "Netanyahu also said it was \"telling\" that he was the first foreign leader to be meeting with Trump since his return to the White House.",
      "\"I think it's a testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase ends in early March. He has said Israel is still committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.",
      "It's unclear where Trump stands.",
      "He has been a staunch supporter of Israel but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement.",
      "The deal has halted the fighting and led to the release of 18 hostages who had been held for over 15 months, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. The military said it remains committed to the deal.",
      "The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Hamas-run health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase, in which the war would end and the remaining 60 or so hostages would be returned, are set to begin Monday. If the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March.",
      "Aspirations for a bigger deal",
      "Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations in their final weeks last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and the two were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase in Washington on Monday.",
      "Trump, who brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term, is believed to be seeking a wider and potentially historic agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.",
      "But the kingdom, which resisted similar entreaties from the Biden administration, has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Netanyahu's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and a key partner, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave the governing coalition if the war is not resumed next month.

    "story": [
      "A decision by the acting leadership at the U.S. Justice Department to delete its public webpages and case summaries of the Jan. 6 siege at the Capitol prosecution has triggered a legal challenge from a watchdog group and blowback from a federal judge who oversaw some of the cases.",
      "The controversial decision has also drawn the ire of one of the rioters who pleaded guilty.",
      "The Justice Department had built a comprehensive database of the approximately 1,600 defendants from the U.S. Capitol attack and had produced a monthly set of reports updating the prosecution, which was the largest in the agency's long history. Last week, the database and designated public web pages went dark, as the agency halted its prosecutions of the rioters, under orders from President Trump.",
      "The erasure of the public resources and information occurred during a period of transition at the agency, with confirmation votes still pending for Attorney General-nominee Pam Bondi and FBI Director-nominee Kash Patel.",
      "In an opinion issued Thursday, U.S. District court judge Paul Friedman noted the deletion of the public information by the acting Justice Department leadership. Friedman included a recent version of the lengthy database in his public ruling, which can be accessed on the federal court system's website.",
      "The list in Friedman's order mirrors the purged Justice Department database, listing riot defendants in alphabetical order and noting their conviction and sentences.",
      "Friedman also blistered the proclamation by Mr. Trump that the Jan. 6 prosecutions were a \"national injustice perpetrated\" on the American people. Friedman wrote, \"The proclamation's assertion if factually incorrect. There has been no 'grave national injustice.' And just because the proclamation was signed by the President does not transform up into down or down into up as if peering through the glass in 'Alice in Wonderland.'\"",
      "Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, a D.C.-based government watchdog group that frequently scrutinizes Mr. Trump, has issued a public letter seeking an investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General and the Archivist of the United States to determine if the deletion of the Jan. 6 public data was a violation of law.",
      "The letter said, \"The Department of Justice's removal of this vital information about its prosecutions arising from the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol is consistent with President Trump's ongoing efforts to rewrite or erase the insurrection, and also a likely violation of federal law.\"",
      "The watchdog group's letter also read, \"Despite the agency's requirement to notify the archivist of the deletion of these records, there is no indication that they reported this matter to NARA, and a list of open 'unauthorized disposition cases' on NARA's website does not reveal any such reporting. Given DOJ's apparent failure to report this matter to NARA as required by law, we are doing so now and request that NARA take appropriate action, including instructing the agency to issue a report in accordance with 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1230.14 and \u00a7 1230.16.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's allies in Congress have been accused of their own efforts to erase the history of Jan. 6. House Republican leadership has defied a 2022 law requiring the hanging of a formal plaque on the US Capitol grounds to honor police heroes who saved the Capitol and Congress from the attack.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has declined to specify if or when the plaque will ever be hung.",
      "Democrats also blasted Republicans for failing to acknowledge the Capitol Insurrection and its victims on the four-year mark of the attack, on Jan. 6, 2025. Republican leaders in the House and Senate did not hold a vigil or commemoration for the victims, which had previously been staged at the Capitol in prior years.",
      "Pam Hemphill, an Idaho woman who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for her role in the US Capitol breach, told CBS News that the deletion of Jan. 6 public records \"is just the latest step in rewriting history for his benefit and is more proof of his utter contempt for the Rule of Law.\"",

      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",
      "Chopra was notified of his firing via an email from the White House, a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the Associated Press.",
      "During his term, Mr. Trump had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "An ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Chopra then was\u00a0tapped by former President Joe Biden\u00a0to lead the consumer agency that he helped launch after the 2008-09 financial crisis. He served as its deputy director, sounding the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt.",
      "Warren, one of Mr. Trump's favorite targets, said in a statement that the CFPB under Chopra held \"Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families\" and prevented \"the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.\"",
      "Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director. But he had publicly stated that he would leave his post if the new president asked.",
      "\"I hope that the CFBP will continue to be a pillar of restoring and advancing economic liberty in America, and I wish you good luck in serving our great country,\" Chopra said in his letter to Mr. Trump.",
      "Consumer Reports applauded Chopra's work at the CFBP saying he \"leaves behind an impressive track record of accomplishments for working families.\"",
      "\"Rohit Chopra has worked tirelessly at the CFPB to make sure that consumers are protected when they take out a loan, make a payment, or open a bank account,\" said Delicia Hand, Senior Director, Digital Marketplace, at Consumer Reports. \"Under Chopra's leadership, the Bureau has scored a number of big wins for consumers, securing billions of dollars in relief for those who have been cheated out of their money and establishing critical new rules to ensure they are treated fairly.\"",

      "Less than 10% of the nation's airport terminal towers have enough air traffic controllers to meet a set of standards set by a working group that included the Federal Aviation Administration and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "The issue has received renewed scrutiny following Wednesday night's midair collision between an American Airlines flight and a Black Hawk Army helicopter near Reagan National Airport outside Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "Only one air traffic control worker was managing the helicopters and some planes from the Reagan National Airport tower at the time of the collision, a job normally done by two people, two sources told CBS News Thursday.",
      "Only about 2% of the towers met the Collaborative Resource Working Group's 2024 staffing targets for the number of fully-trained air traffic controllers. Only about 8% met the target even when including hundreds of air traffic controllers who are still in training, according to the analysis of 2023 staffing data for nearly 200 airport towers.",
      "Additionally, none of the nation's Air Route Traffic Control Centers that handled high-altitude \"en route\" traffic had enough fully-trained controllers to meet the targets either.",
      "The data, from the end of fiscal year 2023, was published in the FAA's Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress on the status of the agency's efforts to overcome a decades-long struggle to recruit and retain enough controllers to keep Americans safe while flying. The data shows staffing at the end of fiscal year 2023.",
      "Nationwide, the working group's target for controllers was about 14,600, the report found. Counting only fully-trained controllers, the nation's air traffic system is at about 72% of that target. It's at 87% if trainees are included. That's about 3,000 to 4,000 controllers short of the targets, depending on whether the hundreds \"in training\" are counted.",

      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the aviation industry and the FAA,\" the agency said in its report. \"At the onset of the pandemic, in order to protect employees and help ensure continuity of operations, certain activities were eliminated or significantly reduced at FAA's air traffic control (ATC) facilities.\"",
      "The agency also noted that \"on-the-job training of developmental air traffic controllers was significantly reduced,\" as well as hiring targets. The agency said that had a significant impact on its efforts to develop fully-trained controllers.",
      "The staffing targets in the report are goals based on an analysis by a group that included FAA's Air Traffic Organization as well as the controllers' labor union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.",
      "The FAA also included in the report its own internal staffing standards for each facility. Using that standard, which is lower for many facilities than the working group's targets, 45% of the airport towers met the standard, counting only fully-trained controllers. If all controllers in training are included, 59% of the airports met the lower FAA standard.",

      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

    "story": [
      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",
      "\"There's a fair number of animals in the U.S. that have never had their photos taken, or there are very little or poor quality photos,\" Jain said, adding that he hopes to continue taking photos of wildlife to aid conservation efforts.",
      "In addition to helping raise awareness about the small mammals facing threats from climate change \u2014 with 89% projected loss of its habitat by the 2080s, according to UC Berkeley \u2014 the students said the photos will be entered into scientific databases, and they will help make it easier for researchers to identify species of the shrews.",
      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",
      "President Trump earlier this week blamed their long stay in space on the Biden administration and said that he'd asked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to bring Williams and Wilmore back home as soon as possible.",
      "But the astronauts are not stranded. Their ride home has been docked to the station since last September and could bring them back to Earth in short order if NASA so ordered.",
      "But that would cause major disruptions to U.S. research aboard the lab because only a single NASA astronaut \u2014 Don Pettit \u2014 would remain aboard the station with two Russian crewmates until the Crew 10 fliers arrive around the end of March.",

They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",
      "Read an excerpt below about how, in eighth grade, he discovered BASIC, which introduced him to the elegance and exacting demands of computer code; and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Bill Gates on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" February 2!",
      "\"Source Code: My Beginnings\" by Bill Gates",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

      "President Trump has signed settlement papers that are expected to require Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to pay roughly $25 million to resolve a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought against the social media giant, according to sources familiar with the agreement.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported the settlement.",
      "The lawsuit stemmed from Meta's suspension of his accounts after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Facebook (which is now Meta) initially suspended and then announced in June 2021 that it would ban Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on Jan. 6 had stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. Twitter, now named X and owned by Elon Musk, also barred Mr. Trump from its social media site for the same reason.",
      "Mr. Trump sued Facebook and Twitter, claiming they had violated his First Amendment right to free speech in \"illegal, unconstitutional censorship.\" He was reinstated on Twitter in 2022 and\u00a0returned to Facebook in 2023.",
      "In complaints filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Mr. Trump had asked the court to overturn Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from liability for content posted on their platforms, and restore his accounts on the two social media sites, as well as his channel on YouTube. He also asked the courts to prevent Twitter, Facebook and YouTube from \"exercising censorship, editorial control or prior restraint in its many forms\" over the posts and uploads of the presidents.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 11:43:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Google will rename the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Denali on its maps for users in the U.S. following President Trump's controversial executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Google Maps users in the United States can expect to see the body of water known for centuries as the Gulf of Mexico renamed the Gulf of America, aligning with the terms of President Trump's controversial executive order. Google also said Denali, a mountain in southern Alaska and North America's tallest peak, is going to be called Mount McKinley on its maps for those same users, reflecting the presidential mandate.",
      "The changes will not take effect until the government updates those site listings in the Geographic Names Information System, an official database that includes descriptions and location information for millions of places within the U.S. As of Tuesday morning, the Gulf of Mexico and Denali still appear as such in the directory.",
      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "In a news release, the agency said the changes \"reaffirm the Nation's commitment to preserving the extraordinary heritage of the United States and ensuring that future generations of Americans celebrate the legacy of its heroes and historic assets.\" The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was set to begin updating \"the official federal nomenclature in the Geographic Names Information System to reflect these changes, effective immediately for federal use,\" the department added.",
      "Although the federal government will formally reference both the Gulf and the mountain by their new names \u2014 in government documents and official U.S. maps, for example \u2014 other nations are not required recognize them. The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president. The name was changed formally to Denali by former President Barack Obama during his administration.",

      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",

      "Mr. Trump acknowledged Sunday that there may be \"some pain\" with the tariffs in a social media post. But he argued that \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "The tariffs come in part to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as illicit drugs, into the U.S. And Rubio's first overseas visit to Central America and the Caribbean, of which Panama is the initial stop, also comes as the Trump administration seeks cooperation on its immigration policy from nearby countries, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",

      "And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities \u2013 agencies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators.",
      "I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations.",
      "Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger?",
      "And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation \u2013 that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were \u2013 almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country.",
      "If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations?",
      "This would be devastating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's \u2013 well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret \u2013 Margaret, it \u2013 we have seen \u2013 but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like \u2013 it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for.",
      "But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air \u2013 the crash.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate.",
      "And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 without legal authority.",
      "Pardon me. Say again?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to \u2013 is it being offered to air traffic controllers?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is \u2013 I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on.",
      "And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs.",
      "What happens if they all quit?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you \u2013 and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents.",
      "I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment.",
      "I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No.",
      "I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo.",
      "Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example \u2013 down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution.",
      "And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs.",
      "He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term.",
      "The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was \u2013 President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking.",
      "And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well.",
      "That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid.",
      "These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador.",
      "Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars.",
      "And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 when it should be the American worker's dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which is a \u2013 separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell \u2013 yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going.",
      "Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently.",
      "And let's make another point on this as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress \u2013 Congress authorizes and earmarks funding.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars \u2013 most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure.",
      "I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say \u2013 this is a little bit hyperbole \u2013 but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad.",
      "That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea.",
      "I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done.",
      "It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about \u2013 you're talking about\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 efficiencies in aids versus restructuring.",
      "So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID.",
      "As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground.",
      "The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened.",
      "So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement.",
      "So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it.",
      "That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker.",
      "That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put \u2013 that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China.",
      "That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations.",
      "But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee.",
      "The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility \u2013 disability. Excuse me.",
      "The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it.",
      "Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal \u2013 a personal aircraft.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft.",
      "To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: \u2026 instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe.",
      "But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well.",
      "And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: \u2026 not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator \u2013 Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it.",
      "Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",
      "Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break.",
      "I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week.",
      "Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time.",
      "One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many.",
      "But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine?",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy.",
      "But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower.",
      "And, by the way, it's not just health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not -",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up.",
      "Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on?",
      "SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week.",
      "We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane.",
      "And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out?",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of \"The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence\"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out.",
      "Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide.",
      "What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity.",
      "Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions.",
      "Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do.",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, \"line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do.\"",
      "Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings.",
      "FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here.",
      "But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements.",
      "Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning.",
      "Good morning.",
      "You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today.",
      "He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did.",
      "I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them.",
      "So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, \"it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal\" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through?",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu.",
      "This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through.",
      "I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen -",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk.",
      "HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "Vincent had undergone radiation and chemotherapy for bladder cancer and developed complications that included bleeding, said his wife, Christina. He asked that treatment be stopped and died Saturday at a hospital in Vero Beach, Florida.",
      "\"Fay Vincent played a vital role in ensuring that the 1989 Bay Area World Series resumed responsibly following the earthquake prior to Game Three, and he oversaw the process that resulted in the 1993 National League expansion to Denver and Miami,\" current MLB commissioner Robert Manfred said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Mr. Vincent served the game during a time of many challenges, and he remained proud of his association with our National Pastime throughout his life.  On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Fay's family and friends,\" Manfred said.",
      "A lawyer who became a movie studio executive at the behest of a college friend, Vincent had been retired for three decades and lived in New Canaan, Connecticut, and Vero Beach.",
      "During his three-year tenure as commissioner, Vincent had a string of what he called \"three-cigar days,\" angering owners by becoming the first management official to admit the collusion among teams against free agents following the 1985, '86 and '87 seasons. He suspended the Yankees' George Steinbrenner, divided expansion fees among both leagues, attempted to force National League realignment and negotiated a settlement that ended a 1990 spring training lockout.",
      "\"I had the conviction that being commissioner was a public trust. I tried to do what I thought was best for the game and the public who cared so much about it,\" Vincent said in a 2023 interview with The Associated Press. \"I had mixed results. Sometimes I'm pleased with what I did. The tragedy of baseball is the single biggest thing I left undone was to build a decent relationship between the owners and the players. I thought somebody would take over after me and get that done. If I died tomorrow, that would be the big regret, is that the players and the owners still have to make some commitment to each other to be partners and to build the game.\"",
      "Born May 29, 1938, Vincent was a securities lawyer when he was hired in 1978 as president and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. by Herbert Allen Jr., who had known him their time as undergraduates at Williams College.",
      "Vincent remained a corporate executive for a decade, then had been with a law firm for only a few months when he was asked to become deputy commissioner by Giamatti, a friend since they met during a party at Princeton in the 1970s.",
      "Giamatti, the former Yale president, was NL president from June 1986 until succeeding Peter Ueberroth as commissioner in April 1989. Giamatti tasked Vincent with supervising the gambling investigation of career hits leader Pete Rose, and Vincent hired lawyer John M. Dowd to lead a probe that led to Rose agreeing to a lifetime ban that August.",

      "Vincent's first World Series in charge was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which struck a half-hour before Game 3 was to start at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. Vincent was praised for a 10-day delay before the series resumed.",
      "\"It is becoming very clear to us in Major League Baseball that our concerns, our issue, is a rather modest one,\" he said then.",
      "His first full season as commissioner began after a 32-day spring training lockout. The deal he reached angered owners seeking greater management gains, a group led by Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox.",
      "In July 1990, Vincent signed an agreement with George Steinbrenner under which the New York Yankees principal owner resigned as managing general partner because of his dealings with a $40,000 payment to a gambler, Howard Spira, to find embarrassing information about outfielder Dave Winfield. Vincent later reinstated Steinbrenner as of 1993.",
      "The following June, Vincent ruled the American League was to receive $42 million of the $190 million in expansion fees due for the National League adding Colorado and Miami in 1993. He also ordered both leagues to supply players equally for the expansion draft and that any future expansion money be divided equally among all clubs.",
      "In July 1992 he ordered NL realignment for the following year, moving the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals to the West Division in 1993, and the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds to the East. The Cubs obtained an injunction in federal court, and the plan was dropped after Vincent's departure.",
      "By mid-August, Selig and Reinsdorf gained enough support to cause AL president Bobby Brown and NL head Bill White to call a special meeting aimed at ousting Vincent. Owners approved a resolution of no confidence in an 18-9 vote on Sept. 3. After a weekend of thought at his home on Cape Cod, Vincent quit four days later, on Labor Day.",
      "\"The commissioner has to look out for the fans, and the owners don't want to hear me speak that idea,\" Vincent said.",
      "Selig was installed as chairman of the executive council, a new position that made him in effect acting commissioner. He led owners through a 7 1/2-month strike in 1994-95, was voted commissioner in 1998 and remained on the job until retiring in 2015.",
      "A longtime Anglophile, Vincent wanted to decompress and rented the Mill House in the Berkshire village of Sutton Courtenay for the first six months of 1993. Living in the home of former British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, Vincent frequently entertained visitors during his sabbatical.",
      "Francis Thomas Vincent Jr. was born May 29, 1938, at Waterbury, Connecticut. His father, Francis, was a football and baseball star at Yale in the 1930s and became a college football official. His mother, the former Alice Lynch, was a housewife.",
      "Vincent was a tackle and center at Williams until he broke his back during his freshman year, falling four floors from an icy ledge outside his dormitory after his roommates locked him out as a prank. His left leg was partially paralyzed and he walked with a cane. Vincent, a Roman Catholic, gave up thoughts of Jesuit training because of the injury. Still, he managed to finish school on time and graduate Phi Beta Kappa.",
      "\"I've been lucky in a lot of ways \u2014 mostly I survived that terrible accident and being paralyzed for so long,\" Vincent said in 2023. \"I can't have any regrets.\"",
      "He went to Yale Law School, started as an associate at Whitman & Ransom in New York in 1963 and stayed there for five years.",
      "In 1968, he moved to Caplin & Drysdale Chartered in Washington and practiced securities law there for almost 10 years, becoming a partner. In March 1978 he quit the firm to become associate director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporate Finance. His stay there was rather brief.",
      "Allen, who was two years behind Vincent at Williams, decided that summer to fire Alan J. Hirschfield, Columbia Pictures Industries' CEO. For more than a year, the company had been in turmoil after David Begelman, president of the movie studio, was discovered to have forged checks.",
      "Vincent replaced Hirschfield on July 13 and ran the company so well that Allen & Co. sold it to Coca-Cola Co. in 1982 for $692 million. Vincent was promoted from president to chairman and was named executive vice president of Coca-Cola's new Entertainment Business Sector.",
      "He went to Hollywood only about six times a year and let his production heads \u2014Frank Price, Guy McIlwaine and David Puttnam \u2014 make the artistic decisions. While Vincent ran the company, Columbia released \"Ghostbusters,\" \"The Big Chill,\" \"Gandhi\" and \"Tootsie.\"",
      "Still, he remained devoted to baseball.",
      "\"He talked about baseball every day,\" Allen said. \"A couple of times I went with him to Mets' opening day.\"",
      "On Sept. 1, 1987, Coca-Cola bought Tri-Star Pictures and Tri-Star's Victor A. Kaufman replaced Vincent, who was reassigned to oversee equity investments in Coca-Cola Bottling's properties. Vincent quit in 1988 and went to Caplin & Drysdale's New York office as a partner. Before he settled in, Giamatti asked him to join baseball.",
      "\"I'd always been a baseball fan,\" Vincent said then. \"I've followed baseball as long as I can remember.\"",
      "In one of his lasting acts as commissioner, he chaired an eight-member committee for statistical accuracy, which removed the asterisk that had been next to Roger Maris' entry as the season home run leader and deleted 50 no-hitters. The group defined a no-hitter as games of nine innings or more that ended with no hits.",
      "He recorded interviews with Hall of Fame members and Negro Leagues players for an oral history project that led to three books: \"The Only Game in Town\" (2006), \"We Would Have Played for Nothing\" (2009) and \"It's What's Inside the Lines That Counts\" (2010). In 2024, he made a $2 million gift to Yale to endow the Yale baseball coach's position in the name of his father.",

      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, said Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presentation before Senate committees last week, though he would not say how he plans to vote on Kennedy's nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, is the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before last week. The Finance Committee announced Sunday that it will vote on whether to advance RFK's nomination Tuesday.",
      "The Vermont independent outlined where he thinks Kennedy is right, pointing to his comments about the nation being unhealthy, about life expectancy relative to other wealthy countries and issues with the food industry. But he stressed that Kennedy \"continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines,\" and was not aligned with him on issues like universal healthcare and targeting the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices.",
      "Sanders also argued that \"the conspiracy theories\" that Kennedy has entertained are \"not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration.\"",
      "The comments come after Kennedy was grilled on his vaccine stance, among other things, during the hearings last week, as his advancement out of committee \u2014 and confirmation by the Senate more broadly \u2014 remains in question.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said he's been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination due to concerns he may undermine faith in vaccines. And without support from Democrats and independents on the committee, Cassidy's opposition could tank a favorable recommendation for Kennedy. In a floor vote before the full Senate, Republicans can lose just three votes to confirm Kennedy without support across the aisle.",

    "story": [
      "The family members of the victims of the deadliest U.S. air disaster in nearly 25 years visited the crash site on Sunday just outside of Washington, D.C.",
      "Ten charter buses with a police escort transported the family members to the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport, close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard.",
      "Meanwhile, federal investigators are working to piece together the events that led to the crash and recovery crews are set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.",
      "The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River after colliding.",
      "The plane's passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.",
      "Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.",
      "The remains of 42 people had been pulled from the river as of Saturday afternoon, including 38 that have been positively identified, officials said. They expect to recover all of the remains, though the plane's fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get the rest.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet's flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "Data from the jet's flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters), when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.",
      "The discrepancy has yet to be explained.",
      "\"Our preliminary review of what the tower cab was showing on the data screen that would have been in front of the controllers, was 200 feet near the time of the accident,\" NTSB member Todd Inman said on Saturday.",
      "Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter's black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.",
      "\"That's what our job is, to figure that out,\" Inman said.",
      "\"This is a complex investigation,\" investigator in charge Brice Banning said. \"There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.\"",
      "Banning said the jet's cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.",
      "\"The crew had a verbal reaction,\" Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed \"the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.\"",
      "Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.",
      "Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.",
      "\"This is a controller's worst nightmare,\" said Inman. \"It hits everyone that works in that cab and knows them very hard. These interviews take a long time because there are several breaks that occur for emotions, just to be able to compose themselves to talk about what happened.\"",
      "According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called \"not normal.\"",
      "\"Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,\" Duffy said, promising that President Trump's administration would address shortages with \"bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.\"",
      "Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:19:13 -0500",
    "summary": "After the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, reached the U.S. in 2022, more than 148 million birds have been euthanized. What is the outbreak's potential impacts on humans, the poultry industry, egg prices, and U.S. exports?",
    "story": [
      "There are seven generations of Corwins in the Aquebogue, Long Island, town cemetery. Their graves overlook the farm that's been in the family since the 1640s. Some family members' tombstones are adorned with ducks. \"I'm gonna say it was my grandfather's idea, because he did it first,\" said Doug Corwin.",
      "It was Corwin's great-grandfather who started raising ducks in 1908, when Long Island was famous for its duck farms. Now, Crescent Duck Farm is the only one left. It produced a million ducks a year, until two weeks ago, when bird flu shut the farm down. Corwin said, \"I saw a flock one day that was great, and the next day was lethargic, wasn't eating. It looked like something I'd never seen before.\"",
      "Dozens of state and local agricultural workers, dressed in biohazard suits, assisted in the euthanasia of the entire flock \u2013 100,000 ducks. Whether it's ducks or chickens, since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, reached the United States in 2022, over 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized.",
      "\"It's a staggering number, there is no doubt,\" said Jodie Guest, a professor of epidemiology with Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta. \"But it is, and always has been a policy across administrations, with the USDA, that this is how they handle infections like this among poultry. And as we've seen bird flu move [across] species, it becomes even more important to try to contain that infection in the flocks that it's in, so that we don't continue to see spread.\"",
      "Except that's exactly what has happened. H5N1, Guest said, was in all 50 states by the end of 2023, transmitted by wild birds through their feces and saliva. \"So, in 2024 we saw bird flu jump from our poultry and wild birds, to mammals, to cows. And that was a very startling change,\" she said.",
      "Until 2024, there was only one human case in the U.S. In just a few months, the number jumped to 67, with one death. Most of those cases were workers at dairy operations and poultry farms. They experienced mild symptoms.",
      "Guest said, \"So far, we've not seen human-to-human transmission, and that would have to happen in order for us to be on the verge of an epidemic or a pandemic.\" She added, however, that she is not scared of that happening: \"I feel very strongly that human risk is still very, very low.\"",
      "But the spread of H5N1 is not being contained \u2026 and look what culling has already done to the price and availability of eggs.",
      "The issue has become politicized. Last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"The Biden administration and the Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of more than 100 million chickens, which has led to a lack of chicken supply in this country, therefore lack of egg supply, which is leading to a shortage.\" In fact, the last Trump administration followed the same policy.",
      "Doug Corwin says, \"A vaccine program is the only thing that's gonna get us out of this.\"",
      "The proposal is controversial: allow poultry farmers to vaccinate their birds against H5N1, something theoretically doable but currently forbidden, because it would cripple U.S. poultry exports to the many countries which ban vaccinated birds. \"The disease is becoming much bigger than the export situation, because the disease is so getting out of hand right now,\" Corwin said.",
      "Corwin can't decide which is worse: losing 100,000 ducks, or having to lay off 48 people.",
      "I said, \"You seem ambivalent about whether or not you even want to try again?\"",
      "\"Martha, think about what I've been through over the last two weeks,\" Corwin replied. \"It's devastating, utterly devastating. It reminds me of losing both of my parents, that sudden ... that grief. It's just that feeling like you've lost something that's part of you.\"",

      "These days, Gates is known largely for his philanthropic work, especially on global health issues. To date, the Gates Foundation has given away nearly $80 billion in grants \u2013 most of that from Gates and his former wife Melinda's own pocket.",

      "But for most of us, he'll always be the Microsoft guy, even though he stepped down as CEO a quarter-century ago. \"The one thing that really held me back was, what if I leave and the company's doing very poorly? A) I'll feel bad, and B) I won't know whether to jump back in or not,\" he said. \"But, you know, fortunately I've never had to even think about it because my successors have been amazing.\"",
      "He was the boy wonder \u2013 the Harvard dropout who became a billionaire in his 30s \u2013 by focusing not on building computers, but on selling the software than ran them. By the time he launched Windows 95, he was at the top of the world.",
      "He had every right to be dancing to The Rolling Stones and yucking it up with the likes of Jay Leno. During his software's launch event, Gates cracked, \"Windows '95 is so easy, even a talk show host can figure it out!\"",
      "But on this day, as he drove us to his favorite drive-in \u2013 BurgerMaster, a Seattle institution \u2013 Gates seemed less like one of the world's richest men, and more like the kid who used to come here with his dad, decades before he would be calling sports heroes, rock stars and world dignitaries his friends.",
      "\"My social skills were very slow to develop,\" Gates said. \"So, except for a few boys similar to me, I didn't have that many friends.\"",
      "He's not saying that for sympathy; he's just being analytical. It's the way his mind works \u2013 and it's the way \"Source Code: My Beginnings,\" the first of his three part autobiography, is written. \"Here is the set-up, the source code that almost certainly was going to lead to some pretty amazing impact,\" he said.",
      "Bill Gates knew he was different. So did his parents. So did his teachers. Had he been growing up today, he says he likely would have been diagnosed as autistic. \"Well, when I'm concentrating now, I'll actually sometimes start rocking, which bothers people without my even, you know, sort of being aware of it. I haven't even outgrown that type of behavior. It's a habit. I mean, [my parents] did put me on a rocking horse to help me go to sleep, they put me in a cradle. So, it's definitely their fault!\"",
      "Whether he is or isn't on the spectrum matters little, he says: \"I mean, even today there's not, like, some magic medicine that gets rid of the bad part and lets you keep the good part.\"",
      "He writes that his parents took him to therapy, sent him to private school, and tried to unglue him from his books by getting him into sports, like skiing and even football. \"I was forced to,\" Gates said. \"There were three teams. There was the varsity, the JV, and then even below JV. And so, we were the lowest tier. And amongst that third tier, I was semi-decent! But that's all that can be said.\"",
      "Almost everything he viewed through the prism of mathematics.",
      "I asked, \"When you talk about math and being good at math and how that kind of revealed all these hidden structures in life and gave all the chaos of the world a certain amount of order \u2013 [whereas] if you're like me, who is not good at math, all I see is sometimes chaos. I don't see the patterns. I don't see the structures.\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I think science is a beautiful thing \u2013 physics, chemistry, biology,\" Gates replied. \"The more you learn, the more kind of the pieces fit together, because all these topics connect.\"",
      "In conversation 40 years ago with Jane Pauley, William Gates III made it clear he was in charge of his destiny. \"I'm used to having a company where the ideas that I have are something that I can easily pursue,\" he told Pauley on the \"Today\" show in 1985.",
      "Is he competitive? \"Yes, and people would say I'm competitive,\" Gates said. \"Yes, definitely. I mean, there was an industry panel once where everybody was disagreeing with me. And at the end of the panel, one of the competitors says, 'Look, Bill is wrong. Bill works so much harder than we do. He's going to succeed. We might as well just give in!'\"",
      "You don't get to be part of that 1% club without making a few enemies along the way. He is a complicated guy. Some say he was ruthless in his business practices, and there are plenty of charges that today he's part of a new American oligarchy.",
      "There were glimpses of his determination even as a freshman at Harvard. He almost got kicked out for breaking the rules in the computer lab. \u00a0\"It turned out I had used by far the most computer time,\" Gates said. \"And so, they're like, 'Well, what are you doing? You know, you're an undergraduate. What the heck?'\"",
      "His computer science professor Harry Lewis remembers him well. Years ago, he dug out the original code that Gates started writing over Christmas break in 1974. \"This was a work of beauty,\" he said.",
      "Those pages of BASIC interpreter code became the Bible of the software revolution.",
      "The 69-year-old Gates says he's made plenty of mistakes, including meeting with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Although the tabloids had a field day with his divorce, he now says that was one of his life's biggest regrets.",
      "But for every critic, there are just as many who speak of Bill Gates in the same breath as Thomas Edison.",
      "Like his BurgerMaster  burger, sometimes Bill Gates has bitten off more than he can chew in his life \u2013 maybe it was a way to challenge himself even in the face of those who still want to challenge him. \"I've been unbelievably lucky, and led a very interesting life \u2013 and it's not stopping!\" he laughed.",

      "PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. (KDKA) \u2014 Punxsutawney Phil is predicting six more weeks of winter after seeing his shadow at Gobbler's Knob Sunday morning.",
      "Thousands of people gather every Feb. 2 to watch Phil make his big prediction at Gobbler's Knob, about an hour and a half drive from Pittsburgh in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. This year's crowd was one of the largest ever, Inner Circle President Tom Dunkel said.",
      "After knocking on Phil's burrow three times, the Inner Circle pulled Phil out of his stump. The Inner Circle's president used his cane to speak \"Groundhogese\" with Phil, who chose the scroll containing his prediction. With a flourish, the scroll was unrolled and read.",
      "\"It's Groundhog Day and maybe life is on a loop, but I miss my burrow, I miss my coop. So I'm heading back down, there's a shadow up here. Get ready for six more weeks of winter this year,\" the scroll read.",
      "What is Groundhog Day?",
      "According to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,\u00a0Groundhog Day has roots\u00a0in the Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day, which, through an old folk song, became tied to weather prognostication.",
      "Once the tradition was introduced to Germany, an animal started predicting the winter. If, according to German lore, the hedgehog saw his shadow on Candlemas Day, there would be a \"second winter.\"",
      "When the German settlers came to the United States, in lieu of hedgehogs, they chose another hibernating animal: groundhogs.",
      "The club says Groundhog Day was mentioned in the local newspaper for the first time in 1886. The next year brought the first official trek to Gobbler's Knob, where thousands now gather every Feb. 2 to wait for Phil's prediction.",
      "This year's celebration is notable because it's Phil's first as a father. He and his \"wife\" Phyllis\u00a0welcomed twins last March, which the public helped name\u00a0Sunny and Shadow.",
      "According to lore, there is only one Punxsutawney Phil, the same way there is only one Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. Phil's Inner Groundhog Club attributes his longevity to the elixir of life, which he drinks every summer.",
      "How often is Punxsutawney Phil right?",
      "Phil has been predicting the weather for nearly 140 years, but practice might not quite make perfect.",
      "Between 2014 and 2023, Phil was right 30% of the time, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. He was correct in predicting a longer winter in 2014 and an early spring in 2016 and 2020.",
      "Since 1887, Phil has seen his shadow 107 times. He's forecasted an early spring 20 times, and for 10 years, there was no record, according to the NOAA's data.",
      "To be fair, the NOAA says it's tough to predict the arrival of springtime for an entire country, especially one with varied regional climates like the United States. After all, he's a groundhog, not a meteorologist.",

      "Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, \u00a0is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on Jan. 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far.",

The military said it remains committed to the deal.",
      "The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages.

      "A pregnant woman believed to have lived over a thousand years ago in Ecuador's coastal region may have been part of ritual sacrifice or punishment, according to archaeologists who excavated her remains in 2022.",
      "In a study published last month by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the\u00a0Society for American Archaeology, experts detailed their analysis of the remains of the young woman, dubbed Burial 10, which dated between AD 771 and AD 953. She was approximately 17 to 20 years old at the time of her death, and her hands and left leg were removed at or near the time of her death, researchers said.",
      "Archaeologists found that her burial is significant because she was pregnant at the time. The young woman's remains showed a cranial fracture and cut marks on her hand bones, which led them to hypothesize that she may have been sacrificed.",
      "\"Perimortem trauma, including a cranial fracture and cutmarks on hand bones, perimortem removal of the hands and left leg, and other body manipulation suggest she was sacrificed, a rare event for coastal Ecuadorian peoples,\" researchers wrote.",
      "Although human sacrifice in coastal Ecuador is rare, the positioning of the body and missing limbs suggest possible ritual significance, the study said.",
      "Her eyes were covered with two ark clam shells. There was a large green clay stone nearby and several ceramic fragments on her forehead, according to the study. Crescent-shaped spondylus mascaras, or mollusk shells, were found around the body.",
      "She was also buried with spondylus pendants and beads, known as chaquira, from various cultural traditions and periods.",
      "The woman is believed to be part of the Mante\u00f1o people, who lived along the Ecuadorian coast and survived by agriculture and seafaring, but the eye coverings were not consistent with typical Mante\u00f1o burials, researchers said. The green stone represented a link between death and fertility for Valdivian burials, a different group of coastal people which predated the Mante\u00f1o by nearly 2,000 years, according to experts. Mascaras were also typically linked to practices of Valdivians.",
      "\"To accumulate so many artifacts required purposeful collection and curation before inclusion in this burial,\" the study said. \"Interpretation of this burial must ultimately consider these repeated emphases and ties to the past to understand the reasons for this enigmatic burial.\"",
      "The burial also included a burnt offering placed in the thoracic cavity, researchers said. However, such rituals have been found to occur later between AD 991-1025, which would indicate that the woman's grave was revisited and possibly used for other rituals.",

Siegel was freed in Gaza City about two hours after Israelis Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon were released in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that all three hostages were in its care and back in Israel after first being handed over to Red Cross personnel in Gaza. Siegel appeared to have lost weight during his captivity, but he waved and smiled as Hamas militants prepared to hand him over to Red Cross staff. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said the three freed men would be reunited with family members and taken for medical checks and care at hospitals in Israel.",
      "Both handovers were conducted quickly Saturday and without the chaos seen during the previous, third prisoner exchange, which angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who delayed the corresponding Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners by several hours.",

      "Keith Siegel is 1st American freed during new ceasefire",
      "Originally from North Carolina, Siegel moved to Israel four decades ago. He was among seven American citizens taken as hostages into Gaza during Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7 attack, which saw militants kill around 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 251 others captive.",
      "Israel's military assault on Hamas in response has killed more than 47,400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, left entire neighborhoods leveled and caused a humanitarian catastrophe by displacing virtually the entire enclave's population and destroying its infrastructure.",

      "Speaking to CBS News about a year after her release, Aviva Siegel said there were moments as Hamas militants forced her and her husband through tunnels under the Gaza Strip that they felt \"sure we were going to die.\"",
      "Yarden Bibas, 35, is the husband of Shiri Bibas, who was taken from their kibbutz with her two young children Ariel and Kfir during the terrorist attack. Hamas claimed just weeks after the attack that Shiri and her two children were killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza.",
      "In a TV interview about a year later, then-Israeli government minister Benny Gantz indicated that officials knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said he could not provide details. The fact that, under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas has released women and children before male hostages, suggested the rest of Yarden Bibas' family was indeed dead.",
      "Ofer Calderon, 54, was among five members of his family seized by Hamas militants from their kibbutz near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023. His two children were released during the ceasefire in November of that year, but two of his cousins were killed.",

      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza's Rafah crossing into Egypt for treatment on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. It marked the first opening of the border since Israel captured Gaza nearly nine months ago.",
      "Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egyptian television showed a Palestinian Red Cross ambulance pulling up to the crossing gate, and several children were brought out on stretchers and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side, the AP reported. Gaza's Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "Rafah is Gaza's only crossing that does not enter into Israel. It was closed by Israeli forces in early May after it was seized during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the crossing in protest.",
      "Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza's Health Ministry, told the AP that more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad and more than 12,000 patients urgently needed treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \"and we hope the number will increase.\"",
      "What has the ceasefire accomplished and what comes next?",
      "Hamas is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on January 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far. With each release of Israeli hostages, scores of Palestinians have been freed from Israeli prisons, with roughly 30 being set free for every hostage returned to Israel alive.",
      "Phase one of the deal was to see all Israeli women, children and male hostages over the age of 50 released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, in addition to a dramatically increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from some areas of the territory.",
      "On the 16th day of the ceasefire, which would be Monday, negotiations to establish the steps for the second phase are meant to begin, according to a draft of the agreement shared with CBS News by a senior Hamas official.",
      "There have been a few moments where it appeared the fragile agreement could fall apart, including when hostage Arbel Yehoud was not released as Israel said she should have been in one of the first exchanges. Quick negotiations led to a resolution of the dispute, and Yehoud was among those freed by militants in Gaza in the third exchange on Thursday.",
      "\"Any deal that takes two or three months to end a war is a bad deal, because it can go off the rails at any point, and at any point either one of the sides can accuse the other of breaching,\" Israeli analyst and former hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"We've already had mutual accusations of breach. Right now, both sides are interested in at least bringing this forward to the end of the 42 days\" of phase one, Baskin said.",
      "Baskin, who has extensive experience negotiating with Hamas, cautioned that \"you couldn't have the two parties further apart\" ahead of the expected negotiations over the second phase of the deal.",
      "\"What we hear from the Israeli side is that they will not end the war or withdraw from Gaza, and what we hear from Hamas is that there is no deal unless it ends the war and brings about an Israeli withdrawal,\" he said.",
      "But Baskin added that the new Trump administration in the U.S. would likely play an integral role in determining how the negotiations actually go.",
      "\"I think it's all on the shoulders of Trump,\" Baskin told CBS News. \"If Trump is determined that this will take place, Netanyahu cannot go against him. Netanyahu may try to create some kind of provocation, leading Hamas to breach the ceasefire, in which case Israel will say to the Americans, 'They breached it and now we have to go back to war.' If Trump says yes, then that's the end. If Trump says 'no, you can't go back to war,' then we will move into phase two.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro after he met Friday with a Trump administration official tasked with urging the authoritarian leader to take back deported migrants who have committed crimes in the United States.",
      "President Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Mr. Trump would continue the \"maximum pressure\" campaign he pursued against Maduro during his first term.",
      "Grenell later posted a photo of the six Americans aboard a flight headed back to the U.S.",
      "Grenell's hourslong trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Mr. Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans.",
      "\"We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\" Grenell posted on X along with a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. \"They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.\"",
      "The meeting in Venezuela's capital took place less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government.",
      "Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't officially recognized.",
      "\"No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,\" Trump responded. \"They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump added that Grenell is \"meeting with a lot of different people, but we're for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Some Republicans criticized the visit.",
      "\"This is terrible timing,\" said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. \"A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.\"",
      "The dispute over the election results sparked nationwide protests. More than 2,200 people were arrested during and after the demonstrations.",
      "Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans who the government has linked to alleged plots to destabilize the country. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.",
      "A nonprofit group that had advocated for the release of a detainee said David Estrella, a 62-yer-old who was last heard from in September, was among those on their way back to the U.S. Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello had accused Estrella of being part of an alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.",
      "The Trump administration has taken a slew of actions to make good on promises to crack down on illegal immigration and carry out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "Those measures include the revocation earlier this week of a Biden administration decision that would have protected roughly 600,000 people from Venezuela from deportation, putting some at risk of being removed from the country in about two months.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday that Mr. Trump had instructed Grenell to \"identify a place and ensure that repatriation flights\" carrying Venezuelans, including members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organization, \"land in Venezuela.\" She said Mr. Trump also ordered Grenell to \"ensure that all U.S. detainees in Venezuela are returned home.\"",
      "Trump wrote Saturday on his social media site Truth Social that he was happy to have the Americans back home.",
      "\"And very important to note, that Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their Country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang members of Tren de Aragua. Venezuela has further agreed to supply the transportation back,\" he wrote. \"We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all Countries, and all Countries have agreed to accept these illegal aliens back.\"",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their home country since 2013, when its economy unraveled and Maduro first took office. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the pandemic, migrants increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuelans' desire for better living conditions and their rejection of Maduro are expected to keep pushing people to emigrate.",
      "Ahead of the presidential election last year, a nationwide poll by Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed about a quarter of the population thinking about emigrating if Maduro was re-elected.",
      "Grenell has reached out to Maduro before on Mr. Trump's behalf to secure the release of imprisoned Americans only to come home empty handed.",
      "In 2020, he traveled with Erik Prince, the founder of controversial security firm Blackwater, to Mexico City for a secret meeting with a top Maduro aide. The backchannel talks centered on Maduro's offer to swap eight Americans then imprisoned in Venezuela for businessman Alex Saab, a close ally of the president charged in the U.S. with money laundering, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "No deal was struck and Grenell's demand that Maduro step down was dismissed by the Venezuelan president's envoy. Grenell has always denied he was negotiating a hostage swap.",
      "Later, in December 2023, the Biden administration exchanged Saab for 10 Americans as part of a policy to re-engage Maduro ahead of presidential elections.",

Keith Siegel, 65, originally from North Carolina, moved to Israel four decades ago and was among those seized during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Hamas had earlier provided three names and Israeli officials confirmed receipt of the list, but it was the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that confirmed the identities, saying it welcomed \"the joyous news regarding the expected release of Keith Siegel,\" along with Israeli nationals Yarden Bibas and Ofer Calderon.",
      "Siegel's wife Aviva Siegel  was also taken during the attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people and take 251 others hostage, but she was released under a brief November 2023 ceasefire and prisoner swap agreement between Israel and Hamas.",

      "Yarden Bibas, 35, is the husband of Shiri Bibas, who was taken from their kibbutz with her two young children Ariel and Kfir during the terrorist attack. Hamas claimed just weeks after the attack that Shiri and her two children were killed in an Israeli bombing in Gaza.",
      "In a TV interview about half a year later, then-Israeli government minister Benny Gantz indicated that officials knew what had happened to the Bibas family, but said it could not provide details. The fact that, under the terms of the ceasefire deal, Hamas has released women and children before male hostages, suggested the rest of Yarden Bibas' family was indeed dead.",
      "Ofer Calderon, 54, was among five members of his family seized by Hamas militants from their kibbutz near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023. His two children were released during the ceasefire in November of that year, but two of his cousins were killed.",

      "Eight hostages held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza were freed Thursday in exchange for the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners, in a third swap facilitated by the fragile ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19.",
      "The exchange began smoothly with the handover of female Israeli soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. But the process devolved into chaos when large crowds surrounded Israelis Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Moses as they were transferred by militants to Red Cross personnel in southern Gaza about an hour later.",

      "Both the European Union and the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said Friday that they were sending staff to help facilitate the limited opening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt's northeastern Sinai Peninsula.",
      "\"Europe is here to help,\" EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said in a social media post. \"The EU's civilian border mission deploys today to the Rafah Crossing at the request of the Palestinians and the Israelis. It will support Palestinian border personnel and allow the transfer of individuals out of Gaza, including those who need medical care.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said, meanwhile, that a first group of sick and wounded Palestinians would be allowed to pass through the Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday, with selected patients and their companions being contacted by phone \"to arrange travel procedures after securing approvals from the relevant parties\" in coordination with the World Health Organization.",
      "In his own statement, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed \"the planned medical evacuation of 50 patients via the #Rafah crossing tomorrow \u2014 the first since the ceasefire began and the first through Rafah since its closure in May 2024.\"",
      "The WHO chief added that between 12,000 and 14,000 \"people still require medical evacuation\" from Gaza, and he called for an acceleration of those evacuations \"through all possible routes.\"",
      "Reports in Gaza suggested all 50 of the wounded Palestinians set to cross into Egypt on Saturday were members of Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. Hamas officials have previously said each of the wounded militants would be permitted to leave through the Rafah crossing along with several of their civilian family members.",

    "summary": "To New Zealand's Indigenous M\u0101ori people, the mountain Taranaki Maunga \"has long been an honored ancestor.\"",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0- A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being.",
      "Mount Taranaki \u2014   now known as Taranaki Maunga, its M\u0101ori name \u2014   is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 8,261 feet and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports.",
      "The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain's theft from the M\u0101ori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since.",
      "The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te K\u0101hui Tupua, which the law views as \"a living and indivisible whole.\" It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, \"incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.\"",
      "A newly created entity will be \"the face and voice\" of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local M\u0101ori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's Conservation Minister.",
      "\"The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,\" Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and M\u0101ori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday.",
      "But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont.",
      "In 1840, M\u0101ori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014   New Zealand's founding document - in which the Crown promised M\u0101ori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the M\u0101ori and English versions of the treaty differed \u2014   and Crown breaches of both began immediately.",
      "In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish M\u0101ori for rebeling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management - but M\u0101ori did not.",
      "\"Traditional M\u0101ori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,\" Goldsmith said. But a M\u0101ori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the M\u0101ori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law.",
      "Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements \u2014   such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023.",
      "\"Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,\" said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain.",
      "\"We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,\" she added.",
      "The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain.",
      "New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island.",
      "Government ownership of the forest ceased under the law and the tribe T\u016bhoe became its guardian.",
      "\"Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,\" the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to M\u0101ori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi.",
      "The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata \u2014 a M\u0101ori song \u2014   from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki.",
      "The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law \u2014   which is not expected to pass - would strip M\u0101ori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades.",

      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",

      "She and Jagger began seeing each other in 1966 and became one of the most notorious couples of \"Swinging London,\" with Faithfull once declaring that if LSD \"wasn't meant to happen, it wouldn't have been invented.\"",

      "Israel did start releasing Palestinian detainees from the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank later Thursday, keeping to its part of the third exchange amid the ongoing ceasefire. Buses carrying the what was expected to be 110 prisoners freed on Thursday were seen leaving the prison about two hours after Netanyahu's spokesman said he had \"instructed to delay the release of the terrorists scheduled to be released today \u2014 until the safe exit of our hostages is guaranteed in the next few days.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office released a subsequent statement saying that, following his demand, ceasefire mediators had \"passed a commitment according to which a safe exit will be guaranteed for our abductees who will be released in the next installments. Israel insists that lessons will be learned and that in future times there will be extra care to return our abductees safely.\"",
      "There were some Palestinians among those being released Thursday who had been accused and, in some cases, convicted of serious crimes against Israelis, including murder. Most of the prisoners were being released and allowed to remain in the West Bank, but some were being sent to third countries, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that five Thai nationals were also released Thursday by militants in Gaza, as had been expected, as part of a separate agreement.",
      "The first Israeli released early Thursday was female soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. Berger was the final hostage from an unarmed, all-female Israeli military unit that had been working to surveil Gaza.",
      "Seven women from Berger's unit were taken hostage during Hamas' Oct. 7 2023 attack on Israel, which saw militants kill about 1,200 people and take a total of 251 others hostage.",
      "Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 47,300 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and decimated the Palestinian territory, displacing virtually all of its population and causing a wide scale humanitarian crisis.",
      "Berger was escorted by militants out of the back of a destroyed building in Jabalia. Wearing an outfit that resembled green military fatigues, she was handed over to members of the Red Cross. Photos shared later by the Israeli military showed her reunited with her parents.",
      "Two other Israeli hostages released Thursday were Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, who was the oldest of the hostages. All three of the freed hostages had been transferred from Red Cross care to Israeli forces on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed.",
      "In a joint statement, the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency said Yehoud and Moses, along with the Thai nationals, had \"crossed the border into Israeli territory\" and were on their way to a reception point in southern Israel. The statement said Yehoud and Moses would be reunited with their families there, as Berger was earlier, while the five Thai nationals would be met by officials from Thailand's government.",
      "Video showed Yehoud being transferred to the Red Cross, more than an hour after Berger's release, in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis amid scenes of mayhem. Yehoud and Moses had been held by the militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Hamas.",
      "A huge crowd had gathered in Khan Younis to witness the handover, which took place near the home of deceased Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar. Dozens of armed militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad paraded through the area and the handover of the prisoners was chaotic, with armed militants, photographers and civilians crowding around the hostages as they were moved to the waiting Red Cross vehicles.",
      "Netanyahu released a statement condemning the \"shocking scenes,\" calling the crush of people around the hostages \"another proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"I demand from the mediators to make sure that such threats will not happen again, and to guarantee the safety of our abductees,\" said Netanyahu.",
      "In its own statement posted online, Hamas called the large crowds, \"a message of determination and defiance raised in the face of this barbaric occupier. It says our people will remain on their land, and are determined to accomplish their project of liberation, return, and self-determination.\"",
      "Hamas did not immediately react to Netanyahu's order to delay the release of 110 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.",
      "Netanyahu's order marked the second delay in the hostage and prisoner swap process laid out by the ceasefire agreement that the Israeli leader blamed on Hamas.",
      "Under to the terms of the deal, Yehoud should have been among the four women released during the second exchange, on Jan. 24. After that release last weekend, the terms of the agreement stipulated that Israel would release a number of Palestinian prisoners from jails and allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, across the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the enclave.",
      "When Yehoud wasn't among those released last weekend, Israel said it would not allow Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor. After a quick negotiation process, Hamas agreed to carry out Thursday's previously unscheduled hostage release, to include Yehoud.",
      "In anticipation of the release and according to the new agreement, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor into northern Gaza on Monday.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have made their way back to the north, most of them on foot, some finding the ruins of their homes and the remains of loved ones, but also reuniting with family members they haven't been able to see in months.",
      "Hamas and its allies are expected to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19. It is hoped that negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of the ceasefire plan will start to yield progress soon.",
      "The next exchange, which will be the fourth, is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Netanyahu has said that will include the release of male hostages in Gaza.",
      "The release of the three people on Thursday left 82 hostages \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 still in Gaza, according to Israeli officials, including seven dual U.S. nationals: Keith Siegel, 65, from Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey. Four other Americans are believed to have been killed. It remains unclear when any of the Americans might be released.",
      "Senior Hamas political official Bassem Naim told CBS News on Wednesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement, \"and we will do our best to make it work and will try to overcome the obstacles and challenges, but we expect that the Israelis will keep trying to find reasons to stop implementing the deal, partly to cover up their failure in achieving any of their goals in Gaza, or due to the scenes that showed the will of the people in Gaza.\"",

      "\"It was a fishing vessel, which is not typically found in the Caribbean,\" Police Commissioner James Sutton told The Associated Press. \"We are not certain, but we believe that this vessel originated off the West African coast.\"",
      "Sutton said officials now face the difficult task of determining the exact number of bodies and identifying them. The advanced state of decomposition, he said, has made it difficult.",
      "This is the first such discovery in recent memory in the twin-island nation.",
      "In August, forensic authorities in the Dominican Republic worked to identify the remains of at least 14 mostly decomposed bodies found on an abandoned vessel 10 nautical miles of its northern coast. The\u00a0Dominican Republic Navy said\u00a0the 14 skeletons appeared to belong to individuals from Senegal and Mauritania, according to the documentation found next to the bodies.",
      "In 2007, three bodies of people believed to be from\u00a0North Korea\u00a0were recovered in northern\u00a0Japan, two days after authorities found a dilapidated empty boat, coast guard officials said. The coast guard said a Japanese fishing boat picked up a male body floating off the coast of Sakata in Yamagata prefecture and two more bodies washed up on a nearby beach an hour and half later. The bodies were decomposed, but one had a lapel pin thought to be North Korean.",

      "\"Based on other research, we think that likely reasons are to do with unmet support needs around mental health, risky behaviors and addictive behaviors, all of which are higher in people with ADHD and can lead to suicide and addictions and can convey health risks,\" senior author Josh Stott, professor of psychology and language sciences at UCL, told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD NOW AFFECTS 15.5 MILLION US ADULTS, SAYS NEW CDC REPORT",
      "Another factor may be that society is not set up for people who have different ways of processing information (neurodivergent as opposed to neurotypical), Stott noted.",

      "For women with ADHD, life expectancy was shortened by 6.5 to 11 years, the researchers determined. (iStock)",
      "The main limitation of the study, according to Stott, is that the researchers could only look at diagnosed rather than undiagnosed people with ADHD, and also that they did not look directly at causes of death.",

      "Life expectancy was shortened by up to 9 years for men and up to 11 years for women, the study found.",

      "The doctor reiterated that the study points to several lifestyle factors contributing to mortality, such as higher rates of smoking, substance use, poor sleep habits and high-risk behaviors resulting in accidents.",
      "\"This indicates that premature death is not caused by ADHD itself, but rather by the effects of untreated symptoms that are potentially preventable.\"",
      "What can be done?",
      "To help reduce ADHD-associated mortality, Stott emphasized the need to provide healthcare systems and interventions that are adapted for people with ADHD and other neurodiverse people, which could require special training and research.",

      "Oakland's $129.8 million budget deficit could eradicate up to 30% of its firefighting capacity, depleting a strapped department already stretched thin by station closures, according to sources on the ground.",
      "Fire response times in the Democrat-controlled California city are already three times the national average after budget cuts that recently closed two fire stations and kept a newly renovated station from reopening.",
      "City Councilmember Zac Unger, who was an Oakland firefighter for 27 years, told Fox Digital that four more stations could face closures because of deficits.",
      "\"We have three firehouses currently closed and another four slated to close ... which would represent about 30% of our firefighting capacity here in Oakland, an absolutely catastrophic potential for the city of Oakland,\" Unger said. \"We simply cannot afford to lose 30% of our fire and emergency medical response.\"",

Fire Chief Damon Covington told Fox Digital inroads have been made to prevent the additional four fire stations from closing, but that's not to say closures won't come down the road.",
      "Firefighters watch water drops on the Palisades Fire in Mandeville Canyon, Jan. 11, 2025, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer)",
      "\"Seven firehouses would represent about 30% of our fire department,\" Covington said. \"It's a tremendous threat because, ultimately, we need more fire service to cover our city adequately, and to lose two firehouses and a third that was under renovation, it taxes our workforce.\"",
      "The fire department\u2019s limited capacity has slowed response time, creating the potential for a disaster like the Palisades and Eaton wildfires, President of Oakland Firefighters Local 55 Seth Olyer said.",
      "\"We had a house fire in the end of east Oakland in Engine 28's area,\" he said. \"Normally, that engine would have been able to get to the fire within four minutes. The closest fire engine took nearly 11 minutes to get there. With a fire doubling in size every minute, you can do the math. This went from a small fire inside the house to a total loss and nearly threatening the surrounding area and potentially starting a wildland fire, much like in L.A.\"",
      "\"Our firefighters do incredible work, and they will make do with whatever difficult circumstances you give them, but yes, we have seen slowed response times,\" Unger told Fox Digital. \"There's simply no way to close firehouses and expect to receive the same level of service.\"",
      "The interim mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment. But in its current budget proposal, the city cites one-time COVID-19 pandemic costs and retirement benefits, including OPEB liability and CalPERs benefits costs, as the \"fiscal challenges leading to [a] projected deficit\" of $129.8 million. Oakland\u2019s 2024-2025 fiscal budget proposed fire station \"brownouts\" for six months beginning January 2025 to save the city $5.5 million.",

      "\"When you close firehouses, it creates a domino effect,\" Covington said in an interview with Fox Digital. \"It's not just the firehouse that you're closing, it's the surrounding jurisdictions, the other firehouses that are close to that firehouse that have to cover the ground of that station.\"",
      "Oakland firefighters say they face the same cuts that the Los Angeles Fire Department warned about ahead of the devastating Palisades and Eaton wildfires in January. Oakland is no stranger to fire devastation itself. The Oakland firestorm of 1991 killed 25 people, injured 150 and destroyed more than 3,000 homes. Olyer said the 1991 fire fundamentally changed fire department response tactics and how fire crews cooperate with surrounding agencies.",
      "\"That fire was so massive it took a herculean effort by the Bay Area and basically fire departments from all over the western U.S. to control,\" Olyer told Fox Digital. \"You\u2019re seeing the same thing with Los Angeles. It\u2019s not realistic to think that any fire department would be able to stop any sort of huge fast-moving wildfire with hurricane force winds in conditions like that.\"",

      "\"The Keller fire, which happened last October, was a perfect example of what a properly staffed fire department and early intensive action can do to really stop a fire before it gets out of control,\" Olyer said.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Red flags to watch out for",
      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

      "Apple has\u00a0uncovered hackers exploiting a vulnerability in iOS that appears to have been lingering for more than a year. The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.",
      "This underscores the critical need for you to update your devices to iOS 17.2 or later, as these versions include essential fixes to safeguard against this actively exploited vulnerability.",

      "In response, Apple has released fixes across its ecosystem, including iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia, watchOS, tvOS and VisionOS. You should update your devices as soon as possible to stay protected. To install the update on your iPhone or iPad:",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings.Tap\u00a0General.Click\u00a0Software Update.Click\u00a0Update Now or Update Tonight.",

      "7 ways to keep your iPhone safe",
      "Protecting your iPhone requires proactive security measures. By following these seven essential steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats and keep your personal information secure.",
      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.\u00a0Tap\u00a0Messages.Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

Upon clicking links within these invites, they are taken to fake web pages that prompt them to input personal data. Once compromised, this information can be used for\u00a0identity theft, financial fraud and unauthorized access to other accounts.

      "The scam begins when people receive a message claiming they have unpaid tolls and may be charged fines.

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Do not share personal information:\u00a0Never provide sensitive details like payment card information, Social Security numbers or one-time passwords via text or unverified websites. Legitimate toll operators will not request such information through SMS.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if some details are compromised.",
      "5) Be wary of urgency in messages:\u00a0Scammers often create a sense of urgency, claiming immediate action is required to avoid penalties. Take a moment to assess the situation and verify the legitimacy of the message through official channels.",
      "6) Report suspicious messages:\u00a0If you suspect a phishing attempt, report it to the Federal Trade Commission or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Include details like the sender\u2019s phone number and any links in the message. Additionally, inform your mobile carrier to help block similar scams.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service: Employ a reputable data removal service to reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of scammers obtaining your personal information. These services can help remove your data from various data broker sites, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "It\u2019s deeply concerning how these scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread. It\u2019s no longer just about random phishing attempts. These are carefully crafted schemes designed to exploit our trust in systems we rely on daily. The fact that scammers can impersonate toll road operators so convincingly is alarming, and it shows how vulnerable we are to such attacks. It frustrates me to think of how many people may fall victim to these tactics, losing their hard-earned money.",

      "Many have linked his situation to Trump\u2019s and blamed the government for jailing the popular former prime minister. Khan\u2019s plight has also been highlighted by longtime Trump ally and adviser Richard Grenell, who took to social media late last year when he tweeted, \"Free Imran Khan!\"",
      "A Pakistani court sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 14 and seven years in jail after finding them guilty of corruption. They were convicted for allegedly accepting land as a bribe through the Al-Qadir Trust, which they had set up while Khan was in office.

There is irrefutable evidence that they not only used the official position to grant illegal favor to a property tycoon, but they also received gratification and formed a sham trust in order to grant this favor to a property tycoon.\"",
      "He continued, \"This is corruption of the highest order, and the former prime minister has been convicted on the basis of irrefutable evidence of corruption and this, this scam, which is the biggest scam in the history of Pakistan, has reached its legal conclusion.\"",

      "Trump's and Khan's experiences with the authorities share are a key similarity, but their stories mirror each other in ways that go beyond just that.",
      "While Trump transformed the U.S. political scene with his \"Make America Great Again\" movement, Khan energized Pakistanis with his \"Naya Pakistan\" (New Pakistan) vision. And in a manner similar to Trump, Khan did away with the elitism of politics, focusing on the average person instead.",

Since Trump's return to office, the South Asian nation has been buzzing with speculation and hope over whether he will force Khan's release. The two have a friendly relationship, with Trump calling Khan \"a very good friend of mine\" at a 2020 forum in Davos. The two first met in Washington in July 2019, which at the time was considered a reset for U.S.-Pakistan relations.",

      "When it comes to national priorities, Trump and Khan have put the economy at the forefront. Khan has also asserted that Pakistan will thrive when he makes his comeback. The country\u2019s economy has teetered on the verge of collapse over the past few years.",
      "\"Economic diplomacy will be central to my approach. Pakistan is rich in natural resources, yet we have barely scratched the surface of our potential in agriculture, industrialization, and IT,\" Khan stated. \"These sectors hold immense promise, both domestically and globally.\"",

      "Explaining his aspirations, Khan concluded, \"Rather than relying on handouts, we must focus on self-sufficiency and leveraging our strengths to build sustainable economic relationships.

      "Khan's message to his supporters and foes alike, \"The people of Pakistan have never been more awake or more determined. They see with clarity what is happening to their nation, and they understand the forces at play.\u00a0I firmly believe that truth and justice will ultimately prevail. And as long as I have breath, I will continue to fight for this cause and for a Pakistan that reflects the will and aspirations of its people.\"",

If Tshisekedi (Felix Tshisekedi, DRC President) can stop armed groups in the south, he can do so in the east as well. He turned to ethnic incitement to distract from incompetent government; that never ends well.\"",

Businessmen in North Kivu, are blunt: Rwanda and Uganda charge less in customs duties than Kinshasa extracts in taxes. Kinshasa cries wolf because Kigali outcompetes them. If Kinshasa wanted businessmen to turn to them, try lowering taxes and building plants to turn raw materials into something with higher sale value.\"",

      "So far, Trump has insulted Canada, played hardball with Denmark over the future of Greenland, cowed Colombia into repatriating undocumented immigrants on his terms and threatened to wrest from Panama the eponymous canal that is a source of great national pride.",
      "All are U.S. allies or partners to varying degrees. The State Department\u2019s own website hails Panama as a democratic \u201cpartner\u201d that works with the United States to \u201cadvance common interests.\u201d",

      "Canada fought alongside the United States in Afghanistan and fed and housed stranded airline passengers who couldn\u2019t land after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. After he slapped Canada with a 25% tariff, Trump wrote Sunday that it is propped up by U.S. subsidies to an extent that it can\u2019t stand on its own. It should become the 51st state, he said on his social media platform.",
      "Separately, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on another U.S. ally and neighbor, Mexico, and ordered a 10% tariff on imports from America\u2019s fiercest global rival, China.",

Canada and Mexico are also close partners. They\u2019re not adversaries. He is swinging the bat when you don\u2019t even need to do that. America already has the upper hand.\u201d",
      "Taking a tough stance with smaller, largely pro-American countries may seem a low-risk proposition for Trump. None wants to antagonize a superpower. Nor do any have nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities.",
      "But there are risks to Trump's brand of diplomacy, national security analysts and former officials say. Nations may rethink their ties to the United States and embrace an eager suitor with billions to spend: China.",

      "\"Colombia is one of a couple of dozen countries with important strategic relations with the U.S. that are increasingly hedging in their relations with China and Russia,\" said a former Biden administration national security official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"This will demonstrate to them that the U.S. is the kind of partner that pulls this s---. You will see as a consequence Colombia saying yes and kissing Trump\u2019s ass in its public messaging and then opening the door to strategic competitors of the U.S. because they don\u2019t consider the U.S. to be reliable.\"",
      "As Trump's defenders see it, Americans want a steely commander in chief who won't let the country get rolled.",
      "He promised nothing less than a \u201cgolden age\u201d for Americans, and if he can expand the country\u2019s influence around the world, boost wealth and gain more cooperation in hardening the borders, he could leave office with a consequential legacy.",
      "\u201cAt some point you need to demonstrate to your adversaries and to your allies who take you for granted and take advantage of you that those days [are] over \u2014 that the American superpower is back and the sleeping giant has woken up,\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served in the White House National Security Council during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Vice President JD Vance defended Trump's actions Sunday on X.",
      "\u201cSpare me the sob story about how Canada is our 'best friend,'\" Vance wrote. \u201cI love Canada and have many Canadian friends. But is the government meeting their NATO target for military spending? Are they stopping the flow of drugs into our country? I\u2019m sick of being taken advantage of.\u201d",

We did that over and over again. What\u2019s different is Trump wanted to do this with military flights. Colombia initially said no to that. Now they\u2019ll take the flights. In terms of limiting migration, it doesn\u2019t matter if the flights are military or civilian.\u201d",

    "summary": "Prices are steady or falling in some parts of the \u201ceconomy\u201d travel market, but budget-minded customers are having to get creative to stick with their plans.",
    "story": [
      "Consumers are looking for ways to travel on tighter budgets. Many are ditching first-choice options like flights for cheaper ones, like long-haul bus rides. Others are just staying home.",
      "Travel demand fell in the second half of last year, when even high-income households spent less on hotel rooms, Morning Consult recently found. It\u2019s the latest sign that consumers are making tough choices when they run out of affordable substitutes for everything from airline tickets to eggs.",
      "\u201cAll the additional costs associated with traveling \u2014 eating out, airfare, gas costs, items to be bought before the trip \u2014 are causing more consumers to walk away instead of making the purchase,\u201d said Deni Koenhemsi, head of economic analysis at Morning Consult.",
      "Those who aren\u2019t walking away are increasingly tweaking their plans.",
      "\u201cI definitely have made some changes to travel based on pricing, timing, etc.,\u201d said Ken Tran, 36, who works in marketing in New York City. He\u2019ll often drop down a star rating on hotel bookings for short trips or hunt for Airbnbs for longer ones.",
      "Tran also said he\u2019s been opting for family visits outside of major holidays \u2014 traveling for Lunar New Year, for instance, instead of Christmas. If a trip is three hours or less, he added, he sticks with basic economy seats, often on buses or trains.",
      "\u201cGoing around the Northeast, there are many more options for travel outside of flying, and when booked in advance, tickets are pretty reasonably priced,\u201d he said.",

This socioeconomic divide has been years in the making as the industry caters to its wealthiest customers and nudges everybody toward premium options.",
      "After affluent consumers dominated the holiday travel season, their plans for the year ahead remain robust. Over 93% of those making at least $200,000 annually told the tourism market research firm Future Partners they\u2019ll be doing as much or more leisure travel this year than last. By contrast, nearly 28% of those making less than $50,000 expect to take fewer leisure trips in the next 12 months, while just 15% of travelers overall said the same.",
      "On the budget end of the market, consumers face trade-offs \u2014 like thinner amenities at economy-level hotels, where room rates have fallen, or downgrading from a domestic flight to a bus as intercity routes expand.",
      "While demand for luxury hotels rose 10% last year, bookings in the economy sector were down 2%, according to Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar Group. Room rates at these cheaper properties were a modest 0.8% lower year over year as of December, he said. Daily rates for budget lodgings averaged $72.11 in 2024, down slightly from $72.69 in 2023.",
      "Dishes that used to be served warm may now be a \u2018heat it up yourself\u2019 item.",
      "Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics, CoStar Group",
      "But to keep prices steady, many operators are trimming costs to offset expenses for payroll, insurance, energy and more, Freitag said.

Planning visits to Manhattan for events or Broadway shows, she often encounters $400 hotel rates that she considers \u201cridiculous for 3-star quality and service.\u201d So instead, she\u2019ll hop on a 90-minute train, spending between $17 and $32 each way when booked far enough in advance, and head home in the evening.",
      "Domestic airfares are about 12% higher this month than in January 2024, according to the booking platform Hopper, which expects the run-up to continue. \u201cLate spring and summer prices are currently forecasted to be above 2024 levels by double digits,\u201d said Hayley Berg, Hopper\u2019s lead economist, though she noted that last summer saw some of the cheapest airfares on record as carriers raced to fill seats they\u2019d added during the pandemic rebound."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 There is growing concern in political circles that Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s nomination for director of national intelligence could be in serious trouble after a confirmation hearing this past week that left even Republican senators openly questioning whether she should be put in such a critical role, multiple people familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "Of particular concern is her refusal to answer directly when asked whether Edward Snowden, a former government contractor who leaked highly classified documents and then sought asylum in Russia, was a traitor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 50-50 she gets through,\u201d one person familiar with the confirmation process said of Gabbard.",
      "Democratic senators are expected to unanimously oppose Gabbard\u2019s confirmation in a full floor vote, which would mean she can afford to lose the support of only three GOP senators in order to get confirmed.",
      "Many officials inside the White House were \u201crattled\u201d by Gabbard\u2019s response to the Snowden question, a person familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking said, adding that she seemed unprepared.",
      "The Snowden moment caught President Donald Trump\u2019s attention, according to another person familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking. As he watched a clip of it, Trump wondered aloud how her lack of a direct answer would play out, this person said.",
      "\u201cHe was curious about how it would affect her chances at nomination or if it wouldn\u2019t matter at all,\u201d this person said.",
      "Gabbard was grilled by senators from both sides of the aisle during her Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about her past comments praising Snowden and suggesting he should be pardoned.",
      "In one exchange with Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., Gabbard refused to definitively say that Snowden is a traitor.",
      "Asked directly whether Snowden is a traitor, Gabbard told Lankford, \u201cMy heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation\u2019s security.\"",
      "\"I have shown throughout my almost 22 years of service in the military, as well as my time in Congress, how seriously I take the privilege of having access to classified information and our nation\u2019s secrets, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m committed, if confirmed as director of national intelligence, to joining you in making sure that there is no future Snowden-type leak,\u201d she added.",
      "When Lankford followed up with the same question, Gabbard simply said, \u201cSenator,\u00a0I\u2019m focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again.\u201d",
      "The fresh doubts about Gabbard\u2019s ability to be confirmed come after the White House, in advance of her hearing, privately made the case that she needed to do the work to win over skeptical senators.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s the one who has the most work to be done in convincing Senators to vote for her,\u201d one of the people familiar with the confirmation process said.",
      "Gabbard prepared for her confirmation hearing extensively, including holding mock sessions, according to a person familiar with the process.",
      "White House officials insist Trump is standing by Gabbard, and he posted an article on Truth Social on Friday that praised her confirmation hearing performance.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump nominated Tulsi Gabbard because he believes she will do an excellent job as the Director of National Intelligence, and we expect the Senate to confirm her,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to NBC News when asked about any concerns about Gabbard\u2019s nomination.",
      "And when asked whether the White House is planning to defend Gabbard just as aggressively as it did for Pete Hegseth, who faced a rocky path to his confirmation as defense secretary, one of the sources familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking said, \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d",
      "This person suggested the White House wants to press senators to vote on her nomination and that the president and his allies will be paying close attention to who supports her and who doesn\u2019t.",
      "Snowden was working as a contractor for the National Security Agency in 2013, when he leaked a trove of highly classified documents revealing the existence of a global surveillance program. Later that year, he was charged by the Justice Department under the Espionage Act and fled to Russia to seek asylum. He became a naturalized citizen there in 2022.",
      "In the past, Gabbard has called Snowden \u201ca brave whistleblower\u201d and even said that she would pardon him when she ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Gabbard said at the time in response to podcast host Joe Rogan\u2019s question about whether she\u2019d pardon Snowden if elected.",
      "At Thursday\u2019s hearing, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, asked Gabbard whether she would advocate for clemency or a pardon for Snowden if she were confirmed as DNI.",
      "\u201cMy responsibility would be to ensure the security of our nation\u2019s secrets, and [I] would not take actions to advocate for any actions related to Snowden,\u201d Gabbard told the senator.",
      "In her answer to a question from Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., Gabbard acknowledged that Snowden should not have leaked all of the documents that he did but still seemed to defend his actions.",
      "\u201cWhat message would it send to the intelligence workforce to have a DNI who would celebrate staff and contractors deciding to leak our nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets as they see fit?\u201d Warner asked.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, he also, even as he broke the law, released information that exposed egregious, illegal and unconstitutional programs that are happening within our government that led to serious reforms,\u201d Gabbard told Warner.",
      "With her confirmation hearing behind her, the Senate panel that questioned her on Thursday will now decide whether to vote her nomination out of committee. If a simple majority \u2014 which could be made up of just Republicans \u2014 backs Gabbard, her nomination will head to a vote of the full Senate.",
      "But with Republicans holding just a one-seat majority on the committee, that looming vote remains precarious for Gabbard, and the fallout from her testimony this past week was immediate.",
      "Lankford, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had previously told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" he was a \u201cyes.\u201d But after Gabbard\u2019s hearing, Lankford told reporters: \u201cI think there are a lot of questions after.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri said, \u201cI am worried that her nomination may be in jeopardy.\u201d",
      "The first person familiar with the confirmation process also said there have been mixed reviews coming out of her one-on-one meetings with senators.",
      "But after her hearing, Gabbard met with the chairman of the intelligence committee, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to review their strategy, according to a source close to Gabbard. The source added that the White House, Cotton and Gabbard have been in lockstep since the hearing.",
      "\u201cWe felt really good about the reaction from Senators Collins and Cornyn,\u201d the person added.",
      "The source said, however, that Gabbard\u2019s team was unsure whether she has support from Lankford and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, had pushed Gabbard during her hearing about her perspective on warrants related to Americans appearing in surveillance data. After the hearing ended, Cornyn told reporters, \u201cI thought she did okay.\u201d",
      "But on Friday, he announced that he plans to support Gabbard\u2019s confirmation.",
      "Collins, a moderate, has shown willingness to vote down Trump nominees, having previously voted against Hegseth. She pressed Gabbard during the hearing on whether she would push for clemency for Snowden.",
      "Gabbard said that she would not seek a pardon for Snowden, prompting Collins to tell reporters that she \u201cwas happy with her responses to my questions, including the question of whether she would recommend a pardon of Edward Snowden, where she clearly said \u2018no.\u2019\u201d",
      "A senior Republican Senate aide told NBC News that he or she thinks Gabbard \u201cis going to get confirmed both at committee and on the floor.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer challenges with members are all fixable,\u201d the aide added."

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino\u00a0in Panama over the weekend, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a readout of their meeting.",
      "Rubio told Mulino about President Donald Trump\u2019s concern regarding Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and that Rubio \u201cmade clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the Treaty,\u201d according to Bruce.",
      "At a press conference at Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition period, Trump did not rule out using military force to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, which he outlined as two of his goals for his second term.",
      "Mulino previously denied that China has control over the canal. The canal is governed and operated by the\u00a0Panama Canal Authority.",
      "The canal used to be owned and operated by the U.S., but it slowly transitioned control to Panama in the late 20th century, releasing its grip on the canal totally by 1999.",
      "One of the treaties governing that transition does ensure that the U.S. can intervene in the canal's authority if Americans feel that there is a threat to the canal operating with neutrality.",
      "In the readout of Rubio's meeting with Mulino, Bruce wrote that Rubio emphasized to Mulino that Trump \"has made a preliminary determination that the current position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal area is a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty.\"",
      "\"We gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn\u2019t give it to China. They\u2019ve abused that gift,\" Trump said at an early January press conference at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Following the meeting with Rubio, Mulino said during a press conference Sunday that Panama is looking into ending its involvement with China's Silk Road Initiative early, and he said that whether the country is able to end the agreement early or not, he will not renew the agreement when it is up in a few years. The initiative is a cornerstone of China's foreign policy.",
      "\"The 2017 Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative, Silk Road, will not be renewed by my government,\" Mulino said in Spanish.",
      "National Security Advisor Mike Waltz celebrated Mulino's announcement, calling it a \"step in the right direction.\"",
      "Rubio\u2019s meeting with Panama\u2019s president touched on a range of additional issues, including the migration crisis currently facing the U.S. and Latin America, improving the country\u2019s investment in climate and Mulino\u2019s support for a free and democratic Venezuela, according to the State Department."

      "Tonya Parker was not looking to add another activity to her life. She traveled the world as a flight attendant and regularly practiced ballet and yoga. She was not searching for new friends, either. A graduate of Spelman College in Atlanta, she had plenty.",
      "With two grown children who made her proud, Parker\u2019s life was full \u2014 or so she thought.",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic led her to a sport she had considered mundane: golf. She was invited to a few golf events and participated. She struggled. But one day, thinking of how tired she was of her friends making fun of her golf game, Parker secretly began taking lessons. Soon enough, her friends noticed improvement. And she noticed her own growing passion for the sport.",
      "\u201cI never thought that a Black woman like me, 63 years old, would ever find something that I just absolutely love at this point of my life,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s opened up a whole new world for me.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just Parker. Many Black people are finding joy in activities that were once inaccessible because of systemic racism or were not culturally traditional pursuits in Black communities. These forays have become emblematic of the ways Black people celebrate the freedom and flexibility they have, and how they are using it to escape the rigors of life \u2014 personally, socially and politically.",
      "The activities have health benefits, too, such as stanching the release of cortisol, a so-called \u201cstress hormone\u201d that affects blood pressure, blood sugar and inflammation, said Linda Goler Blount, president of the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative, which focuses on health and wellness for Black women.",
      "\u201cWhat these folks are doing is giving themselves not only something else to think about, but also giving additional meaning to their lives,\u201d said Blount, who is also an epidemiologist. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be an expensive activity, either.\u201d",
      "She said her sister enjoys adult coloring books as that escape. \u201cThe cortisol piece happens in the brain, and so by finding that joy, you can spend less time thinking and catastrophizing about the other stuff that comes with Black life, which then lowers your cortisol level, which makes you healthier,\u201d Blount added.",
      "That appears to be the case with Parker.",
      "\u201cDiscovering and loving and playing golf has definitely brought me joy,\u201d Parker said. \u201cI am drawn to the solitary pursuit. Although you\u2019re with a group and there can be a lot of chatter around you. You still have this solitary pursuit that challenges you. I love that.\u201d",
      "It helped that she made an elusive hole-in-one after about a year of playing, sinking an 8 iron from\u00a0 the 118-yard shot on the eighth hole of the Seminole Course at White Oak Golf Club south of Atlanta. \u201cThat was a major motivator for my love of the game,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut golf is also a major escape, and it\u2019s also meditative,\u201d she said. \u201cI can think about things that are joyful and not the things that are disturbing to me \u2014 while I stay focused on getting that little ball into the hole.\u201d",
      "Parker, who has played across the U.S. as well as in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, often plays golf with her boyfriend, Tony Hodge, a financial planner who also serves as her quasi-coach on the course.

      "\u201cI was working so much I didn\u2019t have a social life,\u201d he said. He learned about \u201cfun diving,\u201d where a person free-jumps out of a plane by himself and parachutes down to Earth.",
      "\u201cI thought: \u2018That\u2019s different,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s really unique for Black people, really outside the circle.\u201d",
      "After researching the process, Fleurant decided to give it a try.",
      "He underwent intense training at the upstart organization Veterans Skydive for Life before going up for the first time over Minnesota on a small Cessna 172 aircraft. There were three other jumpers on board. The instructor told Fleurant to go first.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018OK, I\u2019m good.\u2019\u201d But then the door opened, and a gush of wind terrified him.",

      "He gathered himself. He put a foot outside the door. He looked down.",
      "\u201cEverything looked like Google Maps,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m still not ready, thinking, \u2018Man, this is something else.\u2019\u201d",
      "Finally, Fleurant lept. He said his only thought once he was airborne was about the parachute. Because he was on a static line, he didn\u2019t have to pull the cord; the parachute deployed on its own after just a few seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re relaxed once the chute comes out \u2014 that\u2019s a big relief.\u201d",
      "On the way down, Fleurant admired the view, while mostly focusing on making a safe landing, which he did.",
      "\u201cI landed on my back,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just laid there, just looked up at the sky for a good minute. I felt good. Accomplished. My adrenaline was so high.\u201d",
      "After five or six jumps, the fear had eased and had been replaced with the urge to flip and twist in the air.",
      "\u201cI feel like a bird then, like I can fly,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m totally relaxed. That\u2019s a good feeling. It\u2019s a huge stress relief, gets me away from work and politics and other stuff that can get to you.\u201d",
      "That escape is invaluable, said Ten\u00e9 T. Lewis, a professor of public health at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we do things that are not always about the hustle and grind, especially during difficult political, social and economic times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to think about ways to add joy and lean into it, because otherwise the stress of the day will kill us. And that\u2019s not hyperbole.\u201d",
      "Fleurant, who is of Haitian descent, said jumping does not come without its mishaps. Once he missed his zone and almost hit a house in Phoenix. On his seventh jump, he said, he fractured his wrist from a \u201cbad landing.\u201d",
      "But he continues to jump \u2014 despite objections from his daughter. Fluerant became certified with 25 jumps and plans to earn a classification that would allow him to jump out of hot air balloons and helicopters.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m addicted,\u201d Fleurant said, but he doesn\u2019t see himself \u201cwalking away from it.\u201d He is looking forward to teaming with other Black skydivers who are part of the groups Diversify Outdoors and Melanin Base Camp.",
      "\u201cI really want to jump with Black people,\u201d he said. \u201cThose groups are really unique. I have to do that. That will be the ultimate Black joy for me.\u201d",
      "Going deep to find joy",
      "At 5, Jennifer Henry\u2019s son Jackson said he wanted to become an astronaut. A few years later, he learned astronauts trained as scuba divers. So he wanted to do that. When Jackson was 10, Henry called a scuba company about lessons. But fearful of the water, she came up with reasons for her son to stay on land for two years.",
      "Finally, when he turned 12, \u201cI swallowed my fears,\u201d Henry said, and signed up Jackson for scuba lessons. The catch: He needed a dive buddy \u2014 someone to go into the ocean with him. His mom decided it would be her.",
      "Although claustrophobic and apprehensive, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let anyone else do it,\u201d she said.",
      "And so began the journey in Southern California of mother and son becoming certified scuba divers together in the last year.",
      "\u201cIt is scary, but the joy I get out of it is being in a completely unusual place,\u201d said Henry, 41. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful down there and I am glad I have done this. I\u2019m doing something that I never imagined, let alone my parents and their parents. I live my life with this whole idea of being my ancestors\u2019 wildest dreams. And so, I think of that all the time when we\u2019re underwater. That is the victory, that\u2019s the freedom. And really I love seeing Jackson pursue his dream. That means everything.\u201d",
      "When he was a kid in elementary school, Jackson wore his astronaut costume everywhere he went, including to see the New York Philharmonic. Everyone noticed, including the performers. He was invited backstage. That was fun for Jackson, but nothing like being underwater with his mom.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool that we\u2019ve done this together,\u201d said Jackson, now 14. \u201cMost moms wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d",
      "Underwater, he likes \u201cthat it\u2019s zero gravity down there. It kind of simulates a space environment. So that\u2019s one of my favorite things about being underwater.\u201d",
      "Seeing beautiful fish and vegetation thrills Jackson, too, as well as the escape. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different world down there with all the fish and the coral and different scenery. It feels like an alien world.\u201d",
      "The duo has ventured into a kelp forest, an underwater area dense with brown algae that supports vast swaths of marine life like sea otters and whales. In Jamaica, Jackson came upon a deep drop-off covered in coral that \u201clooked like an unknown place.\u201d",
      "These experiences, often with the SoCal Black Scuba Divers and Snorkelers in San Diego, thrill them.",
      "\u201cThis is not just his joy for Jackson and for me,\u201d Henry said. \u201cMy parents and his grandparents are feeling this joy, too \u2014 three generations of joy, because every time we dive, we send videos and photos to family. They call. They ask questions. They\u2019re excited. Cousins want to know about it. So this joy expands across generations and through our entire family. And that\u2019s pretty special that this Black family that started off without much can now have this shared joy.\u201d"

The initiative is a cornerstone of China's foreign policy.",

      "Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents hundreds of Education Department employees, said that at least 55 employees had been placed on leave as of Friday evening and that she expected the number to grow as she learns more.",
      "The affected workers included a public affairs specialist, civil rights attorneys, program manager analysts, loan regulators and employees working to ensure schools accommodate special needs children with individualized education programs.",
      "A letter to the affected employees, obtained by NBC News, said they would continue to receive their full salaries and benefits and would not be required or expected to do any work-related tasks or to come into the office during the leave. It also said their email access would be suspended.",
      "\u201cIt looks like they\u2019re entrapping people, because they encouraged people to take these trainings ... and are now maybe using these trainings as a basis to put them on administrative leave,\u201d Smith said.",
      "She added that she is worried that Trump, who has said he wants to eliminate the Education Department, hopes \u201cemployees will eliminate themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it is shock and awe. They\u2019re trying to send us emails that make no sense and are super confusing to intimidate us or to make us run scared so we quit,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to make employees feel like they will soon get fired. And at the same time, they are trying to entice employees with an offer to pay them eight months\u2019 salary if they just resigned,\" Smith added. \"So it seems as if you\u2019re choosing between affirmatively resigning, where they\u2019re saying that you might possibly get paid eight months\u2019 salary and benefits, or eventually getting fired.\u201d",
      "Smith and Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of Government Employees, believe hundreds of employees attended the Diversity Change Agent trainings. An email shared with NBC News shows the Education Department in 2019 had a goal of training 400 employees under the program.",
      "In the email shared with NBC News, which was sent during Trump\u2019s first term, a human resources official with the Education Department wrote to encourage employees to take a two-day voluntary course as part of the agency\u2019s \u201cDiversity Change Agent\" training in March 2019.",
      "The email said: \u201cWe have 25 seats available for this course. The Department\u2019s strategic and comprehensive approach to equipping staff with skills in leading a diverse workforce includes the Diversity Change Agent Program. Graduates of this course are expected to serve as role models, spending some of their official duty time performing activities designed to improve the Education Department\u2019s capacity to attract and retain a diverse workforce. This effort is essential to sustaining a clear and effective Department-wide program.\u201d",
      "The email also said, \u201cThank you for helping us move toward achieving the goal of 400 Diversity Change Agents ED-wide. Your positive actions are the catalyst on our journey to achieving ED\u2019s diversity and inclusion objectives.\u201d",
      "Subodh Chandra, a civil rights lawyer who is representing one of the employees placed on paid leave in the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, said his client was appointed to the employment, engagement and diversity and inclusion council formed during Trump\u2019s first term by his political appointees Kimberly Richey and Kenneth Marcus. Chandra said his client is a West Point graduate, an Army veteran and a former prosecutor who is confused about being placed on leave.",
      "\u201cMy client, a veteran, did nothing to violate any executive order. Nor did any of his similarly situated colleagues. He doesn\u2019t even run a \u2018DEIA\u2019 project. He was only a member of an inactive committee on which he was appointed by Trump\u2019s own political appointees from the first term,\" Chandra said.",
      "Overall,\u00a0dozens of workers at the departments of Education and Energy who did not specifically work in diversity, equity and inclusion roles have been placed on paid leave\u00a0as part of Trump\u2019s effort to eliminate DEI initiatives throughout the federal government, according to Smith and Holder.",
      "Holder said the union believes that there were only two employees in specific DEIA roles at the Education Department and that both of them were placed on leave within days of Trump taking office. Then, Wednesday evening, at least two more employees who attended the diversity training were placed on leave. On Friday evening, dozens of employees who attended the diversity trainings were informed by email that they were being put on leave.",
      "Holder said separately that at least 14 employees at the Energy Department were put on paid leave as part of Trump\u2019s executive order targeting DEIA programs. She said that only three of the employees had titles specifically related to diversity and inclusion positions and that the others had jobs that included tasks like encouraging veterans to work for the Energy Department, as well as working with employee survey data to make workplaces better. Many of the positions were part of the \u201cculture office,\u201d but most did not work on DEIA programs.",

    "summary": "The acting FBI director and an FBI agents group defended bureau staffers and continued to push back on the Trump administration's recent firings of senior FBI officials.",
    "story": [
      "As fear of mass firings swirls through the FBI, acting Director Brian Driscoll and an FBI agents group defended bureau workers in messages to staff members Saturday and continued to push back against apparent Trump administration efforts to force out FBI officials.",
      "President Donald Trump praised the firings of eight top\u00a0FBI career executives Friday and pardoned nearly all the Jan. 6 rioters, including those who assaulted police officers, hours after he took office for his second term.",
      "In a message to FBI staff members Saturday night, Driscoll, the acting director, said again that the Trump administration is seeking the names of every FBI agent who worked on the Jan. 6\u00a0investigations \u2014 a number he has said is in the thousands.",
      "\u201cI want to assure you that we continue to work with the Department of Justice to better understand the purpose for which the lists I referenced yesterday are being sought,\u201d Driscoll wrote.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, the FBI Agents Association sent employees a notice that many agents had received an email from senior officials ordering them to respond to a \u201c12-question survey\" asking about their involvement in Jan. 6 cases, according to two people who received it.",
      "\u201cWe have confirmed that this is accurate and we anticipate a large majority of our members will receive this,\u201d the association wrote. \u201cAt this point in time, we recommend deferring to your division leadership on how to handle these surveys.\u201d",
      "Regarding one of the questions, the association recommended that agents respond with the following wording: \"I have been told I am \u2018required to respond\u2019 to this survey, without being afforded appropriate time to research my answers, speak with others, speak with counsel or other representation.\"",
      "The association recommended that they also write, \u201cTo the best of my ability and belief, I have performed my duties in accordance with ... federal statutes and the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "Legal experts, as well as current and former FBI officials, say the Trump administration appears to be waging an unprecedented campaign of retribution against prosecutors and law enforcement officials who worked on the criminal investigations of Trump and his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\u201cThis is completely uncharted waters,\u201d said Pennsylvania State University professor Douglas Charles, who specializes in the history of the FBI.\u00a0\u201cThere have been times, different points, where the FBI has been reorganized. This is not that. ... It just seems to be a wholesale dismantling of the independent culture of the FBI.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, promised during his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday that \u201call FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\u201d",
      "But just over 24 four hours later, Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general and Trump\u2019s former defense lawyer, ordered Driscoll to remove the eight top FBI career executives and requested the names of all agents who worked on Jan. 6\u00a0cases.",
      "If Patel is confirmed by the Senate, he could immediately remove Driscoll and collect the names of the agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases. Patel could place those agents on administrative leave, transfer them to new positions or attempt to fire them.\u00a0The exact date of Patel's Senate confirmation vote is not publicly known.",
      "Agents association issues advice",
      "On Saturday,\u00a0the FBI Agent Association, an organization that represents agents but is not a union, issued a statement expressing concern about what it said are further efforts to force FBI agents to quit.",
      "\u201cThere are several amongst our ranks who are extremely fearful of being removed \u2014 and some of those have started to pack up their desks,\u201d it said in a bulletin to members.",
      "The message gave agents advice about what to do if they believe they are at risk of being fired.",
      "\u201cDo NOT resign or offer to resign,\u201d the message said. \u201cWhile we would never advocate for physical non-compliance, you need to be clear your removal is not voluntary.\u201d",
      "\u201cStay calm and refrain from making any statements that could be deemed to violate the Hatch Act,\" it added, referring to law that bars federal civil servants from engaging in political activities. \"If you are told you will be terminated, make sure you get the termination notice in writing and forward it to us ASAP.\u201d",
      "In his message Saturday, Driscoll pointed out that agents do not pick the cases that are assigned to work on, and he said that merely working on a controversial matter is not evidence of misconduct.",
      "\u201cAs career special agents \u2014 and fellow FBI employees \u2014 we know firsthand that none of us are assigned to matters based on anything other than the responsibilities of the roles in which we serve,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo let it be absolutely clear that we do not view anyone\u2019s identification on one of these lists as an indicator of misconduct.\u201d",
      "He went on to say FBI agents are afforded civil service protections if they are referred for discipline. The rules are designed, in part, to prevent interference from elected officials in the bureau's criminal investigations.",
      "\u201cThis well-established process both ensures accountability and affords employees appropriate due process and review in accordance with existing policy and law,\u201d he added. \u201cThat process and our intent to follow it have not changed.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the Society of Former FBI Agents also criticized apparent efforts to force out officials.",
      "\u201cWe are very disturbed to learn that FBI employees are being subjected to requests for their resignation or retirement or face immediate summary dismissal,\" it said. \"These employees are not being provided a reason for such personnel actions and are not being afforded the required due process.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Driscoll refused to go along with an effort to fire a larger number of agents involved with Jan. 6\u00a0cases so forcefully that some feared he would be fired, current and former FBI officials told NBC News.",
      "In a message that circulated widely among FBI personnel, an FBI agent summarized what happened as: \u201cBottom line \u2014 DOJ came over and wanted to fire a bunch of J6 agents. Driscoll is an absolute stud. Held his ground and told WH proxy, DOJ, to F--- Off.\u201d",
      "A former FBI official who knows Driscoll well said, \u201cHe pushed back hard.\u201d",
      "A senior FBI official disputed the accounts of the current and former officials, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not true.\u201d"

      "Outlets of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario will also take U.S. products out of its catalog so other retailers can\u2019t order or restock those items, according to a\u00a0Sunday statement\u00a0by Premier Doug Ford.",
      "\u201cEvery year, LCBO sells nearly $1 billion worth of American wine, beer, spirits and seltzers. Not anymore,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to choose an amazing Ontario-made or Canadian-made product.\u201d",
      "Ford\u2019s announcement came just hours after Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0slapped retaliatory tariffs\u00a0of 25% against $155 billion of U.S. goods.",
      "The LCBO is one of the largest wholesalers of alcohol, selling\u00a0more than 1.1 billion liters\u00a0of alcohol products in Ontario in 2023. According to the\u00a0Observatory of Economic Complexity, Canada primarily imports hard liquor from America with an estimated $320 million in sales. The U.S.\u2019s second main export destination for liquor as of October 2024 is Canada, with a $25.9 million trade value, according to the OEC.",
      "In a statement provided to CNBC, the LCBO said it will be stopping all sales of U.S. alcohol products online and in stores \u201cindefinitely,\u201d adding that it is the \u201cimporter of record\u201d for all American alcohol into Ontario. LCBO currently lists more than 3,600 products from 35 U.S. states, the statement added.",
      "The move follows other similar Canadian premiers\u2019 announcements of retaliation to the tariffs, including Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston\u00a0directing\u00a0the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation to remove all American alcohol from their shelves on Tuesday and British Columbia Premier David Eby\u00a0directing\u00a0the BC Liquor Distribution Branch to \u201cimmediately stop buying American liquor from \u201cred states\u201d and remove the top-selling \u201cred-state\u201d brands from the shelves.\u201d"

      "In a June 2022 Vogue Australia story about Australian creatives, Censori spoke about splitting her time between her hometown and the place she called home in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI find making ideas come to fruition much easier in Australia,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cIn Melbourne I can cultivate my creativity, and L.A. is where I apply it.\u201d"

      "Fans speculated Baldoni, who directed the film, and Lively were feuding amid the release of the movie in August 2024. Then on Dec. 20, 2024, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department, setting off a series of lawsuits.",
      "On Dec. 31, 2024, Baldoni and his publicists sued the New York Times for libel for an article published about Lively's sexual harassment complaint. That same day, Lively filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and his publicists, alleging she was retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment.",
      "Baldoni subsequently sued Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and her publicist, accusing them of defamation on Jan. 16.",

      "\u201cMr. Baldoni\u2019s lawyers base their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe sleuths have noted that a version of the Lively state complaint published by The Times carries the date \u2018December 10\u2019 even though the\u00a0complaint wasn\u2019t filed until more than a week later. The problem: that date is generated by Google software and is unrelated to the date when The Times received it and posted it.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Lively, Reynolds and Sloane for comment on the amended complaint.",
      "The website launch comes weeks after Freedman released behind-the-scenes footage that he argues doesn't corroborate Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set. In her December legal complaint, Lively alleged that Baldoni improvised scenes of physical intimacy and crossed boundaries.",
      "Her lawyers responded to the footage release in a statement to NBC News, claiming, \u201cThe video shows Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character,\u201d Lively\u2019s legal team said. \u201cEvery moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\u00a0Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively\u2019s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively\u2019s boss.\u201d",
      "Freedman previously said in a January interview on TODAY that his team planned  \u201cto release every single text message between the two of them,\u201d referring to Baldoni and Lively.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that in any way is a concern about this entire situation from our perspective, and we want the truth to be out there,\u201d Freedman said at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Amanda Riley has made plenty of headlines for her elaborate cancer hoax. Her story was the subject of a hit 2023 podcast, \u201cScamanda,\u201d and a new ABC News docuseries of the same name.",
      "However, her husband, Cory Riley, has stayed largely out of the public eye.",
      "He did not speak at his wife\u2019s sentencing hearing in May 2022, when she was handed a 60-month sentence for wire fraud and required to pay restitution to her victims. He also does not appear to have given any media interviews about her case.",
      "Starting in 2012, and throughout much of their marriage, Amanda Riley said she was battling Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of blood cancer, per a sentencing from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Northern District of California.",
      "However, it later emerged that the young mom had faked having cancer. She had perpetuated the hoax for years, sharing updates about her supposed cancer journey on social media and blogs and soliciting more than $100,000 in donations from nearly 350 supporters.",
      "A court document viewed by\u00a0TODAY.com\u00a0revealed that Cory Riley filed for divorce from Amanda Riley in 2024 and was living in Texas.",
      "The couple met when Cory Riley was still married to his first wife, Aletta Souza. He and Souza shared a daughter, Jessa.\u00a0Cory Riley was also a stepdad to Souza\u2019s older daughter, Jaymie, from Souza\u2019s first marriage.",
      "Souza recounted how Amanda Riley came into the family\u2019s lives during her May 2022 sentencing hearing.",
      "Her daughter Jaymie was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in 2002.",
      "\u201cShe was unable to be out in public or attend school because she was immunocompromised,\u201d Souza said. \u201cTherefore my husband at the time, Cory Riley, and myself, did our best to accommodate Jaymie\u2019s needs from home.\u201d",
      "Amanda Riley, then 17, was hired to teach Jaymie cheerleading, Souza said at the hearing.",
      "A few years later, Cory Riley and Souza divorced, and Cory Riley ended up marrying Amanda Riley in 2011. Amanda Riley became a stepmother to Jessa and she seemed to embrace the role, calling Jessa her \u201cbonus daughter.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmanda was a big part of Jessa\u2019s life because we had shared custody,\u201d Souza said at the sentencing hearing. \u201cCo-parenting can be tricky, and adding a stepmom to the mix, even more difficult, but we managed for a bit, and then things changed.\u201d",
      "Amanda Riley spoke about her husband at the sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize to my family. Cory, my husband, my parents, my brothers, our best friends that we consider family, and our kids,\u201d she said. \u201cOur lives will never be the same because of my choices, and I\u2019m so sorry for that.\u201d",
      "She also mentioned their sons, Carter and Connor.",
      "\u201cOur two young boys were babies when this started, so they were too little to be affected by my bad choices,\u201d she said. \u201cNow to see them as big boys who are going to see their mom go through this process, is going to flip their world upside down.\u201d",
      "Amanda Riley is serving a five-year sentence at the Federal Medical Center Carswell, a federal prison in Ft. Worth, Texas. Her release date is Dec. 4, 2025, according to her inmate record."

      "Ferrell said he didn't think so, but the Oscar winner clearly had a story to share. Witherspoon explained that years ago while introducing a \u201cvery serious, proper actress\u201d at a British event, she accidentally roasted her, which led to a falling out.",
      "\u201cSo this friend of mine, who I didn\u2019t really know that well, but she was a very serious, proper actress, and she asked me to give her an award, but I had never been to this award ceremony, so I thought it was like a roast,\" Witherspoon said. \"So I got up, and I roasted her.\u201d",

We\u2019re not friends anymore. I\u2019m not even kidding \u2014 we\u2019re not friends anymore. I think she doesn\u2019t like me anymore.\u201d",

The movie also co-stars Nick Jonas as a \u201chot pastor,\u201d they teased.",
      "The actors began their joint interview by reminiscing about the first time they worked together on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2001. Witherspoon shared that she\u2019s a big fan of the comedian and that his film \u201cTalladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\u201d is her family\u2019s favorite, along with \u201cElf.\u201d"

      "\u201cLove Me\u201d is described as a sci-fi romance that takes place after the end of humanity. It follows Buoy (Stewart) and Satellite (Yeun), two robots on Earth that have access to the internet and learn what it means to be alive and in love. The film \u2014 which only features the two characters \u2014 is unlike any other. \u201cLove Me\u201d explores artificial intelligence and one\u2019s identity with the use of live-action, animatronics and animation.",
      "\u201cWe wrote it during the pandemic, so it was the two of us ... adults, going around and around and around, doing the same thing every day,\u201d co-director and writer Sam Zuchero tells TODAY.com, adding the film is about \u201chow that affects you and your mentality about who you are and who your partner is.\u201d",
      "Co-director and writer Andy Zuchero adds that the film attempts to uncover the differences between how we present ourselves and who we actually are.",
      "Now in theaters, the stars of the film, Stewart and Yeun, as well as directors and writers Sam and Andy Zuchero, share insight into the sci-fi romance and what happens at the end of \u201cLove Me.\u201d",
      "What happens in 'Love Me'?",
      "\u201cLove Me\u201d is set in the future after the end of humanity on Earth. A Buoy, who has access to the internet, becomes interested in human beings and attempts to form its own identity.",
      "While scrolling the internet, Buoy, who self identifies as \u201cMe,\u201d comes across a social media influencer named D\u00e9ja and her boyfriend-turned-husband Liam. D\u00e9ja and Liam\u2019s seemingly perfect life revolves around \u201cDate Night 2.0,\u201d which includes making quesadillas in onesies, kissing and snuggling with their dog while watching \u201cFriends\u201d.",
      "Buoy, AKA Me, adapts D\u00e9ja\u2019s life as the inspiration for her newfound life. She then meets Satellite, whom she gives the name \u201cIam\u201d (pronounced I am). Without his knowledge, she helps Iam become Liam based on D\u00e9ja\u2019s social media.",
      "The two build a virtual reality where they bring their characters to life.",
      "As the two interact, they begin to feel their feelings and subsequently question their emotions, interactions and choices.",
      "What follows is a couple that experiences\u00a0unrealistic expectations on their relationships. Me wants the picture-perfect life and begins to feel unsatisfied after Iam tells her that their life is fake.",
      "Overcome with what appears to be depression, Me goes off the grid and disappears for a billion years. During that time, Iam discovers that Me made up their life based on D\u00e9ja and Liam.",
      "\u201cHer sinking is me getting into bed and pulling the covers over my head,\u201d Sam Zuchero tells TODAY.com. \u201cThat moment where you\u2019re just like, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna do this right now. I\u2019m not gonna deal. I\u2019m gonna go inward and I\u2019m gonna just close off.\u2019\u201d",
      "When Me decides to return, they continue to struggle with their identities. Iam tells Me he doesn\u2019t want to be lied to and wants to create his own identity. Additionally, Iam wants to take things slow, Me becomes obsessive with their relationship and thinks he doesn't love her.",
      "\u201cI want you and not D\u00e9ja,\u201d Iam tells Me, explaining that they are not the people who she created them to be.",
      "After an intense fight, Me asks Iam, \u201cCan we try again?\u201d to which he says, \u201cWe have all the time in the world.\u201d",
      "The film ends with them in a new home in what appears to be a bustling city. Iam asks Me what they should do for dinner and Me replies they should go out.",
      "Who do Buoy and Satellite represent?",
      "Sam and Andy Zuchero actually built real-life robots for the movie and took them to locations to show the Earth's transformation.",
      "As for what they represent, Buoy, or Me, is someone looking for a connection, while Satellite, Iam, is programmed to find and connect with a life form on Earth.",
      "Stewart tells TODAY.com that Me is \u201ca pretty naive character\u201d and  \u201csomebody who feels lonely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI play a buoy who is living in an icy ocean after humans no longer exist, and she\u2019s kind of hearing the echo of that loss and exhibiting it, but not really able to be it,\u201d Stewart explains. \u201cSo she ... desperately looks around and tries to find connection with the only other thing around her, which is this satellite.\u201d",
      "Buoy forms a \u201cnot-so-real personality\u201d in order to be looked at and liked, Stewart adds. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t feel too separate from what it feels like to try to get to know yourself to the extent that someone might like you.\u201d",
      "Stewart likens her character to a baby who has the whole internet at their fingertips, \u201cAnd all I want is to just hang out with one person. How do I make that happen?\u201d",
      "\u201cThen she tells a few lies, and then really regrets it, but then realizes that there was a lot of truth in those lies,\u201d she explains.",
      "As for Yeun, he tells TODAY.com that Satellite, Iam, is just serving a function until he meets Buoy \u201cand then all of a sudden, he becomes conscious of himself, and he\u2019s wanting to be defined.\u201d",
      "Once he\u2019s defined, Yeun says his character attempts to understand what that means. He eventually discovers that he would never have been able to define himself if it wasn\u2019t for Buoy\u2019s help. \u201cAnd so (his) journey was a mirror of her journey.\u201d",
      "What happens at the end of 'Love Me'?",
      "Andy Zuchero explains that the movie starts with humankind\u2019s extinction \u2014\u00a0\u201cThough we don\u2019t actually reveal why, we\u2019ll just say simultaneous crises.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the movie ends with our rebirth through these two new beings, and the fact that they \u2018have all the time in the world\u2019 means that they\u2019ll continue to evolve as we\u2019ve evolved over 200,000 years, and the Earth has evolved for 5 billion,\u201d he says.",
      "Stewart, on her end, feels that at the end Buoy and Satellite have a \u201cbreathy moment\u201d where they get to relax. And with the passage of time, they will \u201ccreate a situation\u201d where they have to keep communicating and growing.",

      "A small girl in a pink sweater waved goodbye through the smudged window of a bus as it prepared to depart Gaza on Saturday, packed with 37 ill and injured patients, most of them children with cancer, in need of medical treatment that Gaza's war-ravaged hospitals cannot provide.",
      "It was the first time in nine months that medical evacuees have been able to leave Gaza by the Rafah border crossing, and outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, weary mothers held their sick and listless children wrapped up in coats, anxiously waving their documents at officials to confirm their place.",
      "But their departure was bittersweet \u2014 only a few patients made the list that day, and each could bring only one companion.",
      "A small boy who tried to squeeze his way onto the bus with his sick brother and mother was escorted off.",
      "\u201cThey did not allow me to pass,\u201d Khalil, 8, still sobbing from being separated from his family, told NBC News' crew. \u201cMy brother went with my mom; he is sick.\u201d",
      "The evacuees left by the Rafah crossing into Egypt, which has been reopened as part of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Under the deal, 50 patients and wounded are set to be evacuated every day under the supervision of the World Health Organization.",
      "While much of the attention on the ceasefire has focused on the hostage releases, the daily medical evacuations will be chipping away at a mountain of need.",
      "\u201cWe need to speed up the pace, because, again, we estimate between 12,000 to 14,000 critical patients are needed to medevac,\u201d Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization representative for the occupied Palestinian territories, who was overseeing the evacuation, told NBC News' crew in Gaza.",
      "\u201cTrauma injuries, think about amputees, many of them children. Spinal cord injuries, burns, which need multiple different specialized operations and rehabilitation, which they currently cannot get in Gaza. The other is patients for oncology, cancer patients, chronic diseases and cardiovascular diseases, which need to be medevaced out of Gaza.\u201d",
      "The conflict has destroyed much of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, causing its health system to collapse. Beyond the enormous needs of the skyrocketing number of war wounded, hundreds of thousands of people with acute and chronic illnesses were left with limited or no access to medicine and treatment.",
      "According to the WHO, from the start of the war on Oct. 7, 2023, to when the ceasefire began on Jan. 19, Gaza's health care system sustained more than 1,200 direct attacks, including at least 660 on health facilities, and over 1,000 attacks that affected health care workers.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces says Hamas operates command centers at hospitals, uses ambulances to transport fighters and diverts fuel aid intended for hospital use to military purposes, charges that Hamas and hospital staff members deny.",
      "The scale of the crisis for patients remains overwhelming, and for some children, it is too late.",
      "Dr. Muhammed Abu Salmiya, the director general of Al-Shifa Medical Complex, once Gaza's top hospital, said two of the children scheduled for evacuation Saturday died before they could make the journey.",
      "Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for 2,500 children to be \u201cimmediately evacuated with the guarantee that they will be able to return to their families and communities.\u201d",
      "Medical evacuations were rare even before the Rafah crossing closed. From October 2023 to May, the United States, hospitals, various nongovernmental organizations and local officials in Gaza were able to quietly move just 150 patients, most of them children, out of Gaza for lifesaving care.",
      "After the Rafah crossing shut down when Israeli forces captured it in May, the improbable became nearly impossible.",
      "The last significant evacuation appeared to have been in June, when 21 critically ill children were evacuated from the Gaza Strip."

The latest bout of fighting has been worsening for around three years, with clashes between national troops and Rwanda-backed M23 insurgents escalating in January. More than 400,000 people were displaced last month alone, the United Nations says. Firefights in Goma have also claimed the lives of several United Nations peacekeepers."

Hamas had not provided the names of the first hostages it planned to free that afternoon, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to continue.",

      "The police in Gaza fall under the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry, and enforce laws set by the militant group after it took control of the Strip in 2007. Israel considers members of the police force to be Hamas terrorists and legitimate military targets, even though some officers also carry out more mundane duties like traffic enforcement and crime prevention.",

      "Rubio told Mulino about President Donald Trump\u2019s concern regarding Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and that Rubio \u201cmade clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the Treaty,\u201d according to Bruce.",
      "At a press conference at Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition period, Trump did not rule out using military force to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, which he outlined as two of his goals for his second term.",
      "Mulino previously denied that China has control over the canal. The canal is governed and operated by the\u00a0Panama Canal Authority.",

      "One of the treaties governing that transition does ensure that the U.S. can intervene in the canal's authority if Americans feel that there is a threat to the canal operating with neutrality.",
      "In the readout of Rubio's meeting with Mulino, Bruce wrote that Rubio emphasized to Mulino that Trump \"has made a preliminary determination that the current position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal area is a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty.\"",
      "\"We gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn\u2019t give it to China. They\u2019ve abused that gift,\" Trump said at an early January press conference at Mar-a-Lago.",

The initiative is a cornerstone of China's foreign policy.",

      "Zhu Jingyang wrote in Spanish that China and Colombia were enjoying \u201cthe best moment\u201d in more than four decades of diplomatic relations.",
      "\u201cYou have the Chinese ambassador trying to take advantage in the short term,\" Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview.",
      "In taking a hard-line stance, Trump may have been trying to signal other countries in addition to Colombia that he won't brook any dissent: Leaders must take back their compatriots living in the United States illegally.",
      "It\u2019s not clear, though, that the dustup with Colombia was necessary. Colombian President Gustavo Petro had objected to the Trump administration\u2019s sending people back on military planes, saying they shouldn\u2019t be treated like criminals.",
      "Petro ultimately relented, averting what could have been a ruinous trade war with the United States.",
      "But during the Biden administration, the United States was already returning Colombians to their home country, the former Biden national security official said.",
      "\u201cOur administration got the Colombians to take between 100 and 200 repatriation flights of Colombians back to Colombia,\u201d the person said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a new thing. We did that over and over again. What\u2019s different is Trump wanted to do this with military flights. Colombia initially said no to that. Now they\u2019ll take the flights. In terms of limiting migration, it doesn\u2019t matter if the flights are military or civilian.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the spat with Colombia was \u201ca day of fake drama.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe media acted as if Colombia had capitulated. It didn\u2019t,\" Murphy added. \"There were three flights a week before the dustup, and there are three flights a week now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe [Trump] created good headlines for himself without changing anything.\u201d"

And when she got off the train, she didn\u2019t know it would be the last time she would see her mother, 12-year-old brother and two young cousins; they were likely sent to the gas chambers.",

    "story": [
      "MAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 For people fleeing the conflict in Myanmar, the injuries are often more than just physical.",
      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",
      "\u201cSometimes, some people feel that this way is usual,\u201d Maung said, \u201cbut this is not normal.\u201d"

      "Officials from the Trump administration had said earlier on Friday that one of Grenell\u2019s top aims for the visit was to secure the release of Americans detained in the country, at a time when the Trump administration has been driving a deportation and anti-gang push in the United States.",
      "Grenell did not name the six men, shown with him aboard an airplane in a photo he posted online. They were dressed in light blue outfits used by the Venezuelan prison system.",
      "\u201cWe are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,\u201d Grenell posted on X. \u201cThey just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn\u2019t stop thanking him.\u201d",
      "Trump cheered the move in his own post, saying Grenell was bringing \u201csix hostages home from Venezuela.\u201d",
      "It is unclear exactly how many Americans were being held by Venezuela, but Venezuelan officials have spoken publicly of at least nine.",
      "Maduro\u2019s officials have accused most of them of terrorism and said some were high-level \u201cmercenaries.\u201d The Venezuelan government regularly accuses members of the opposition and foreign detainees of conspiring with the U.S. to commit terrorism. U.S. officials have always denied any plots.",
      "\u201cAmerican hostages that are being held in Venezuela ... must be released immediately,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone, the U.S. special\u00a0envoy\u00a0for Latin America, said earlier on Friday, adding the Grenell-Maduro meeting was \u201cnot a negotiation in exchange for anything.\u201d",
      "In late 2023, Venezuela\u2019s government released\u00a0dozens of prisoners, including 10 Americans, after months of negotiations, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro.",
      "Maduro told officials in an annual speech to the judiciary late on Friday evening that the meeting between him and Grenell had been positive.",
      "\u201cThere are things where we\u2019ve reached initial deals and when they are complied with, new issues will open, hopefully new deals for the good of the two countries and the region,\u201d Maduro said, adding he would be looking to see if what had been discussed with Grenell was reflected in what is communicated by the U.S. about the meeting.",
      "\u201cPresident Donald Trump, we have made a first step, hopefully it can continue,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cWe would like it to continue.\u201d",
      "Maduro and Grenell also discussed migration and sanctions at the presidential palace, the Venezuelan government said in a statement earlier on Friday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier on Friday that Grenell was also focused on ensuring 400 members of the Tren de Aragua gang in U.S. custody are returned to Venezuela.",
      "An agreement on Tren de Aragua deportations was \u201cnon-negotiable,\u201d Claver-Carone said.",
      "Venezuelan attorney general Tarek Saab said last week that the gang had been dismantled in Venezuela in 2023, but that it was willing to restart legal cooperation with the U.S. in order to extradite gang members.",
      "Since taking power on Jan. 20, Trump has kicked off a\u00a0sweeping immigration crackdown, pledging mass deportations.",
      "Some 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States were eligible for deportation reprieves granted by the previous administration, but U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she would cut the duration of the protections. She must\u00a0decide by Saturday\u00a0whether to terminate them.",
      "Grenell\u2019s visit does not mean the United States recognizes Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, Leavitt said.",
      "The two countries have a fraught recent history marked by broken relations, sanctions and accusations of coup-plotting.",
      "But they share interest in several\u00a0pending bilateral issues, including a license allowing U.S. oil major Chevron\u00a0to operate in Venezuela.",
      "The administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden reinstated broad oil sanctions after it said Maduro failed to keep promises for a free presidential election and later\u00a0increased rewards\u00a0for the capture or conviction of leaders including Maduro, leaving Trump limited options for further penalties.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government-backed victory in the July 2024 vote is contested by the opposition, international observers and numerous countries, including the United States.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government has always rejected sanctions by the United States and others, saying they are illegitimate measures which amount to an \u201ceconomic war\u201d designed to cripple Venezuela.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 19:57:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",
    "story": [
      "The White House said Friday that President Donald Trump would impose a 25% tariff on goods coming to the U.S. from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on those from China on Saturday, a move that could drive up prices for products coming into the U.S. from those countries.",
      "Trump had said he would issue those tariffs on the first day of his presidency, then said on Inauguration Day that the tariffs would be put in place on Feb. 1. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that Trump would carry through on that Feb. 1 deadline.",
      "Trump said Friday that there was nothing that the three countries could do to avoid the tariffs, which he said were in response to the import of fentanyl into the U.S. and because the U.S. has a trade deficit with the three countries. The U.S. is considered to have a trade deficit with those countries because it buys more goods and services from them than it sells to them.",
      "The tariffs could increase how much U.S. consumers and businesses pay for goods coming from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 including electronics, toys, shoes, fresh produce, lumber and cars. Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods into the U.S., similar to a tax.",
      "While some businesses will look to source goods elsewhere, others with no alternatives will be forced to pay the fees. Companies will have to decide whether to pass these higher costs to consumers or absorb them, which would dent profits or require cuts to protect their margins. The implications could be wide-reaching across the U.S. economy, in part because American consumers and businesses imported more goods from Mexico than any other country.",
      "Trump also said he would be putting tariffs on oil and gas imports in the next several weeks as well as on computer chips, steel and aluminum, but didn't provide any details. In addition, he said he would be putting a \"tariff wall\" around pharmaceuticals to bring the industry back to the U.S.",
      "\"It'll be a tremendous amount of money for our country, tremendous amount, these are big numbers,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"And in addition to that, and you see the power of the tariff, I mean, the tariff is good, and nobody can compete with us because we have by far the biggest piggy bank.\"",
      "When asked about the impact tariffs will have on inflation, Leavitt cited relatively low inflation during Trump's first term when he placed tariffs on billions of Chinese goods.",
      "\"President Trump is going to do everything he possibly can to cut the inflation crisis that the previous administration imposed on the American people, and he will continue to effectively utilize tariffs,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Tariffs during Trump's first term were more limited in scope than the current proposal and included a long list of exemptions and delays for certain products and industries. Economists have found those tariffs drove up prices for some imports, led to a net loss of manufacturing jobs and reduced corporate investments as a result of higher costs companies had to pay to import materials and parts.",
      "Mexico and Canada have threatened to retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. imports, which could hurt American businesses that sell to those countries, like oil producers, farmers and manufacturers.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that he was meeting with U.S. and Canadian officials to try to prevent the tariffs from being put in place, but that Canada was prepared to respond if tariffs were enacted.",
      "\u201cIf the President does choose to implement any tariffs against Canada, we\u2019re ready with a response. A purposeful, forceful, but reasonable immediate response,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday. \"We won\u2019t relent until tariffs are removed and, of course, everything is on the table.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, China placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture products, and nearly all the revenue collected by the U.S. from the tariffs on China went to payments to American farmers to offset their losses from those Chinese tariffs.",
      "The U.S. auto industry is among the most vulnerable to the tariffs on Mexico and Canada.

      "An order sidelining almost 60 senior career leaders at the U.S. Agency for International Development was temporarily rescinded Thursday by one of the few remaining senior career civil servants with the authority to do so, two current and two former USAID employees told NBC News.",
      "Hours later, the same career employee was also placed on administrative leave.",
      "\u201cThe materials show no evidence that you engaged in misconduct,\u201d Nick Gottlieb, USAID's director of employee and labor relations, said in an email to the dozens of senior USAID employees placed on paid leave Monday. \u201cAs a result, I no longer have authority to maintain you in this status.\u201d",
      "Gottlieb acknowledged that he did not know how long his decision would hold.",
      "\u201cYou may receive another email within the day reinstating your leave status.\u00a0However, that notice will not come from me,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI wish you all the best \u2014 you do not deserve this.\u201d",
      "USAID has been reeling since the State Department announced a near total freeze on U.S. foreign aid in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order. In addition to the dozens of career senior civil servants and foreign service officers placed on administrative leave, hundreds of contractors for\u00a0agency\u00a0were fired this week, and hundreds more are being furloughed, according to two former and two current\u00a0USAID\u00a0employees.\u00a0More furloughs are expected in the coming days according to two of the sources.",
      "Hours after reinstating senior career leadership Thursday, Gottlieb was also placed an administrative leave for refusing a request from USAID\u2019s front office and Trump's newly created Department of Government Efficiency to issue \u201cimmediate termination notices to a group of employees without due process,\u201d he wrote in a farewell letter to all USAID employees reviewed by NBC.",
      "\u201cIt is and has always been my office\u2019s commitment to the workforce that we ensure all employees receive their due process in any of our actions,\u201d\u00a0Gottlieb wrote.\u00a0\u201cI will not be party to a violation of that commitment.\u201d",
      "He closed by requesting that those still working at the agency be kind to his staff which undoubtedly will be shorthanded \u201cIt has been an honor working with all of you at this Agency, which I treasure,\u201d he wrote.",
      "USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued an expanded waiver to the sweeping freeze of U.S. foreign aid to include all life-saving assistance, but so far the exemptions to the executive order have not slowed the cuts to the USAID workforce.",
      "\"We have this thing that I\u2019ve called the foreign aid industrial complex: All of these entities around the world that are getting millions and millions of dollars from the United States,\u201d Rubio said in an interview Thursday with Megyn Kelly. \u201cWe have to make sure that it\u2019s aligned with our national interest, that we are prioritizing that and that we\u2019re spending it on things that really matter and are really producing.\u201d",
      "A former USAID official, Jeremy\u00a0Konyndyk, warned that the damage caused by the cuts to both the U.S. funding of aid groups and the staff of the development world cannot be easily reversed.",
      "\u201cThere is a there is a symbiotic relationship between the U.S. government and its nonprofit and contractor partners to implement US foreign aid policy, to pursue humanitarian goals and global health goals abroad,\" \u00a0Konyndyk, now president of the aid group Refugees International, said in an interview. \"It\u2019s very sophisticated. It\u2019s very intricate. If this goes on for really any significant amount of time, it will really break the architecture of U.S. foreign aid that has been developed over 50 years.\u201d"

      "\"I look forward very much to visiting Taranaki to deliver the Crown apology in the near future,\" Goldsmith said."

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel\u2019s ban on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees went into effect Thursday in a move that the world body has warned will jeopardize humanitarian aid efforts in the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem.",
      "The move comes as 2 million Palestinians living in those areas are grappling with the destruction wrought during the 15 months of the Gaza war and its timing \u2014 coming at an especially vulnerable moment for the Palestinian territories \u2014 has alarmed the international community.",

      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, which saw the country seize the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Since then, it has built and expanded Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Most countries deem them illegal under international law, a position disputed by Israel which sees the territory as a security bulwark.",
      "Israel, which claims that Hamas members have infiltrated UNRWA, argues that the agency\u2019s absence will depoliticize humanitarian aid, make delivery more efficient and help keep it out of Hamas\u2019 hands.",
      "UNRWA Director-General Philippe Lazzarini has warned of \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences if Israel bans the aid organization from the Palestinian territories.",
      "The ban comes into effect less than two weeks after a Gaza ceasefire deal allowed for a surge in humanitarian aid into the enclave with the expected weekly entry of 4,200 trucks of aid.",
      "Because they claim that UNRWA has exaggerated the proportion of Gaza\u2019s aid it provides, Israeli officials say that other aid bodies, other UN agencies and municipal departments will step in to fill the gap left by UNRWA."
