      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault has told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set",
      "PARIS -- A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris on Wednesday that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d). He denies any sexual assault.",
      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",
      "In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: \u201cI said no, I was scared.\"",
      "She also described telling Depardieu \u201cno\u201d during a third similar incident.",
      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",

      "Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker and city leaders honored the Oscar and Grammy winner on Wednesday, renaming a street next to Smith's old high school.",
      "\u201cPhilly, I love you. I am yours. You are mine,\u201d Smith said at a ceremony along a section of 59th Street that now bears his name.",

      "Thirty years ago, Latino music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar",
      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "ALBUQUERQE, N.M. -- Authorities have released body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February.",
      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home. With no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn\u2019t see how that could have been the case.",
      "\u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d one of the workers said.",
      "Authorities soon determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, further fueling a mystery that captured the public\u2019s attention.",
      "It was solved about a week later when medical investigators confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 took the life of his wife.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office released only some of the footage from the investigation.",
      "A New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home. Hackman\u2019s estate had filed the petition to withhold images, citing the need to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment.",
      "Workers who had maintained the property talked to investigators about respecting Hackman and Arawaka\u2019s privacy. One worker described Arawaka as a private person.",
      "The body camera footage also shows brief sightings of one of the couple\u2019s dogs running in the wooded hills on their property on the edge of Santa Fe. A man who identified himself to officers as a dog trainer who cared for the couple\u2019s pet dogs said the couple were \u201cnuts\u201d about their dogs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s toys everywhere around the property,\u201d he said.",
      "In a separate video, Arakawa\u2019s hairdresser told investigators that his client took the dogs with her everywhere and that the smallest one would often hang out inside the salon with them during her visits.",
      "That dog was found inside a crate, not far from Arakawa\u2019s body. A report obtained by The Associated Press from the state Department of Agriculture\u2019s veterinary lab states the dog likely died from dehydration and starvation.",
      "The actor\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth Hackman, told authorities she wanted the dog that died to be cremated. Authorities put her in touch with the local animal shelter to talk about the options.",

      "With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, G\u00e9rard Depardieu reigned over cinema for half a century",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",

      "On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O\u2019Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note",
      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",
      "The ceremony will be streamed on Netflix on May 4.",

      "The departures were announced at a meeting of agency senior leaders. The Atlanta-based CDC has two dozen centers and offices.

      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations",
      "WASHINGTON -- With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations, which meteorologists and former agency leaders said will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.",
      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",

      "Russia has convicted 23 captured Ukrainians on terrorism charges stemming from the fighting in Ukraine in a trial that Kyiv denounced as a sham and a violation of international law",
      "Russia on Wednesday convicted 23 captured Ukrainians on terrorism charges stemming from the fighting in Ukraine in a trial that Kyiv denounced as a sham and a violation of international law.",
      "The defendants included 14 current or former fighters of the elite Azov brigade, which Russia designated a terrorist group, and nine women and one man who worked as cooks or support personnel, according to Russian media reports and rights activists. Twelve defendants were not in court \u2014 11 had returned to Ukraine in two prisoner exchanges and were convicted in absentia. One more died in custody last year, and the case against him had been closed.",
      "All had been charged with staging a violent coup d\u2019etat and organizing the activities of a terrorist organization. Some faced an additional charge of training to carry out terrorist activities.",
      "Those convicted were given sentences ranging from 13 to 23 years in prison. The 12 men still in Russian custody will serve their sentences in maximum security penal colonies, according to the court ruling.",
      "Memorial, a prominent Russian rights group that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022, has designated all the defendants as political prisoners. According to Memorial, some of them were captured in 2022 during fighting in the port city of Mariupol, where they held out at the Azovstal steel mill, besieged by Russian troops. Others were detained as they tried to leave the city after it was overrun by Russian forces, the group said.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s human rights envoy, Dmytro Lubinets, denounced the proceedings when they began in June 2023 as \u201canother sham trial\u201d held for Russia\u2019s \u201cown amusement.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Russia\u2019 and \u2018fair justice\u2019 have nothing in common. The world must respond to such shameful sham trials of Ukrainian defenders,\u201d Lubinets said at the time. \u201cIt is obvious to everyone that those who should be in the dock are not those defending themselves but those who initiated the aggression, those who invaded foreign land with weapons, and those who arrived with tanks on the territory of an independent state!\u201d",
      "That same month, Ukraine\u2019s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on X that the trial of combatants amounted to \u201can official war crime\u201d that warrants a response from the International Criminal Court.",
      "Petro Yatsenko, a representative of the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of POWs, echoed his sentiment in remarks quoted by the Hromadske news outlet, saying the proceedings violated the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war.",
      "The trial was held in a military court in Rostov-on-Don, where Russia\u2019s Southern Military District is headquartered, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the border with Ukraine.",
      "Russian independent news site Mediazona reported that the defendants testified about abuse behind bars during the trial, saying they were severely beaten and had their bones broken, were interrogated with bags over their heads, were given food laced with household chemicals and were forced to stand all day long and sing the Russian anthem.",
      "These allegations are in line with reports by Russian and international human rights groups that detail systematic abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilian captives in the Russian custody.",

      "Greenland and Denmark appear cautiously relieved by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday",
      "Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.",
      "The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance\u2019s previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.",
      "The vice president\u2019s decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing. The minister said the change was a deescalation, even as he said the Americans are treating it as the opposite, with Vance suggesting in an online video that global security is at stake.",
      "Anne Merrild, a professor and Arctic expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders.",
      "Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.",
      "\u201cIt's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.\u201d",
      "Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland.",
      "\u201cWhat is controversial here is all about the timing,\u201d he said. \u201cGreenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don\u2019t want the U.S. to visit right now, when Greenland doesn\u2019t have a government in place,\" following the election earlier this month. Coalition negotiations are ongoing.",
      "Ahead of the vice president\u2019s announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had \u201cnot extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.\u201d",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was \u201cunacceptable pressure.\"",
      "Usha Vance's office said Sunday that she would depart Thursday for Greenland and return Saturday. She and one of the couple's three children had planned to visit historic sites and learn about Greenland\u2019s culture, but her husband\u2019s participation has reoriented the trip around national security, her office said.",
      "Vance said leaders in Denmark and North America had \u201cignored\u201d Greenland for \u201cfar too long.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump\u2019s plans.",
      "Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative, said that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cintimidation\u201d of Greenland could backfire.",
      "Menezes said if Trump was \u201csmart enough\u201d to understand Greenland\u2019s strategic importance, then he should also be \u201csmart enough to know there is no greater way to weaken America\u2019s hand and hurt its long-term interests than turning its back on its allies, the principal asymmetrical advantage it enjoys over its adversaries.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has included a desire for territorial expansion, as he seeks to add Canada as a 51st state and resume U.S. control of the Panama Canal. He has also indicated that U.S. interests could take over the land in the war-torn Gaza Strip and convert it into a luxury outpost, displacing up to 2 million Palestinians.",

      "CAIRO -- Sudan's army said Wednesday it had recaptured Khartoum's international airport and a key base of the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, bringing it closer to regaining full control of the capital for the first time in nearly two years of war.",
      "The military announced the seizure of the airport on social media, saying Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan had landed there and inspected troops. It posted a video showing a smiling Burhan in a military helicopter descending to the tarmac, where some traces of wreckage were visible.",
      "Troops also recaptured the RSF\u2019s last stronghold in Khartoum, the Teiba al-Hasnab camp, army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah Ali said on social media.",
      "There was no immediate RSF comment.",
      "Sudan's military on Friday retook the Republican Palace, the seat of the prewar government. The RSF had held the palace, the airport and large parts of the capital since the war began in April 2023.",
      "\u201cThis is a pivotal and decisive moment in the history of Sudan,\u201d Information Minister Khalid Aleiser, spokesman of the military-controlled government, declared on social media. \u201cKhartoum is free, as it should be.\u201d",
      "Military control of the airport, along with calm in Khartoum, could allow aid groups to fly more supplies into the country where the fighting has driven some 14 million people from their homes and pushed some areas into famine.",
      "At least 28,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher.",
      "The RSF is still believed to hold scattered positions in Khartoum. But liberating the capital doesn\u2019t end the conflict, as the RSF still controls parts of the western Darfur region and other areas.",
      "The war erupted when the military and the RSF turned against each other in a struggle for power. Their battles around Khartoum quickly spread across much of the country.",
      "For most of the war, Burhan and the government have been based in the Red Sea coastal city of Port Sudan.",

The government insists the judiciary is independent, but critics say the evidence is based on secret witnesses and lacks credibility.",
      "Early Thursday, student demonstrators tried to march and gathered to read a statement near the gates at Middle East Technical University, pro-opposition broadcaster Halk TV and local media reported.

Proceedings are ongoing for 662 other people.",

He faces charges stemming from two investigations into the opposition-controlled Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality -- a corruption case and one alleging support for terrorism.",

      "British Steel says it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the north England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government",
      "LONDON -- British Steel said Thursday that it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the northern England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government.",
      "Unions called on the government to help secure the future of the company, which Jingye said is suffering daily losses of around 700,000 pounds ($900,000) despite the Chinese firm investing more than 1.2 billion to maintain operations since its takeover of British Steel in 2020.",
      "The company, Britain's second-biggest steelmaker, blamed \u201chighly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\u201d",
      "British Steel said it is consulting with unions over the the decision to close the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations and reduce rolling mill capacity, potentially as early as June. Between 2,000 to 2,700 jobs are potentially at risk.",
      "The company had sought support from the government for a major capital investment in two new electric arc furnaces, which would emit far less carbon into the atmosphere, but no agreement was reached after months of negotiations.",
      "Unions published a report last month setting out how to decarbonize steelmaking at British Steel, which would involve the continued operation of Scunthorpe\u2019s two existing blast furnaces while two new electric ones constructed on site. The plan would require an additional 200 million pounds of government support to mitigate carbon costs in the interim period.",
      "\u201cThis is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country,\" said Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union. \u201cThe closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains.\"",
      "Rickhuss urged Jingye and the government to get back to the negotiating table and said the Chinese company \u201chave not ruled out\" retaining the blast furnaces during a transition if they can win government backing.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron says that a proposed European armed force for possible deployment in Ukraine in tandem with an eventual peace deal could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that a proposed European armed force for possible deployment in Ukraine in tandem with an eventual peace deal could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine\u2019s president and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on Thursday that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine that Macron suggested could be deployed in \u201cimportant towns\u201d and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.\u201d",
      "Macron, together with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has been driving an effort to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of an armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing a lasting peace by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged in the eventuality of a Russian attack.",
      "He said the proposed European forces wouldn't be stationed on the frontlines in Ukraine, \u201cnor be engaged on the first day opposite Russian forces.\u201d They would \u201cbe forces that dissuade the Russians from attacking again. And by holding important towns, strategic bases, mark the clear support from several European governments and allies,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the frontlines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \"The only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "Macron is expecting 31 delegations around the table Thursday morning at the presidential Elysee Palace. That\u2019s more than the French leader gathered for a first meeting in Paris in February \u2014 evidence that the coalition to help Ukraine, possibly with boots on the ground, is gathering steam, according to the presidential office.",
      "The big elephant in the room will be the country that\u2019s missing: the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has shown no public enthusiasm for the coalition\u2019s discussions about potentially sending troops into Ukraine after an eventual ceasefire to help make peace stick. Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has dismissed the idea of a European deployment or even the need for it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic,\u201d he said in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.",
      "That\u2019s not the view in Europe. The shared premise upon which the coalition is being built is that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine \u2014 starting with the illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and culminating in the 2022 full-scale invasion that unleashed all-out war \u2014 shows that he cannot be trusted and that a European force could help dissuade another attack.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Macron both suggest that a foreign contingent in Ukraine could also provide military training, something allies already have been doing outside Ukraine, preparing more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops for battle against Russia\u2019s larger and expanding military and helping to make up for some of Ukraine's losses from more than three years of intense fighting.",
      "\u201cPrimarily, any contingent consists of combat units, but they are above all intended to control the situation, monitor it, carry out joint training, and also to prevent any desire by Russia to return with renewed waves of aggression,\u201d Zelenskyy said at Wednesday's news conference with Macron.",
      "European officials say that in any peace-deal scenario, Ukraine\u2019s first line of defense against any future Russian aggression would be Ukraine\u2019s own army. The 27-nation European Union is pressing ahead with a so-called steel \u201cporcupine strategy\u201d aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defense industry.

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s auto tariffs are a \u201cdirect attack\u201d on his country and says the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump's auto tariffs are a \u201cdirect attack\u201d on his country and that the trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low.",
      "Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25% tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated, \u201cThis is permanent.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a very direct attack,\u201d Carney responded. \u201cWe will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.\u201d",
      "Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on U.S. relations.",
      "Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) \u201cstrategic response fund\u201d that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Autos are Canada\u2019s second-largest export. Carney noted the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.",
      "\u201cCanada will be there for auto workers,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.",
      "The president has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.",
      "The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021.",
      "\u201cHis trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,\u201d Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada\u2019s April 28 election.",
      "The tax hike on auto imports starting in April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales.",
      "Trump previously placed 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as on all of America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 on April 2.",
      "\u201cHe wants to break us so America can own us,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAnd it will never ever happen because we just don\u2019t look out for ourselves, we look out for each other.\u201d",
      "Carney, a former two-time central banker in Canada and the U.K., made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing.",
      "Carney said the bridge carries $140 billion Canadian dollars ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day.",
      "\"Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,\" Carney said. \u201cThe relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.\u201d",
      "In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province has the bulk of Canada\u2019s auto industry, said auto plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead.",
      "\u201cPresident is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes tell people \u2019Your fired!\u201d I didn\u2019t think he meant U.S. auto workers when he said it,\u201d Ford said.",
      "Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians.",
      "Canadians booed Trump repeatedly at a Carney election rally in Kitchener, Ontario.",
      "The new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump. It is unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.",
      "\u201cIt would be appropriate that the president and I speak given the action that he has taken. I\u2019m sure that will happen soon,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said the tariffs will damage American auto workers just as they will damage Canadian auto workers.",
      "\"The message to President Trump should be to knock it off,\" Poilievre said. \u201cHe's changed his mind before. He's done this twice, puts them on, takes them off. We can suspect that may well happen again.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- An appeals court in South Korea overturned an election law conviction against opposition leader Lee Jae-myung Wednesday, potentially clearing the way for him to mount a presidential campaign.",
      "The courtroom victory comes as the country's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol could face an early exit due to his short-lived imposition of martial law and surveys show Lee, leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, is the early favorite to replace him.",
      "Yoon, a conservative, has been suspended from office since the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached him over his Dec. 3 martial law decree plunged the country into political turmoil. The Constitutional Court is deliberating on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate him. If he's removed, there will be an election to replace him within two months.",
      "On Wednesday, the Seoul High Court overturned Lee's conviction for making false statements during his 2022 presidential campaign, canceling his suspended sentence of a year in prison. Lee still faces four other criminal trials, none of which are likely to be resolved soon.",
      "Lee was convicted by the Seoul Central District Court in November of making false statements about a controversial land development project launched when he was a city mayor, and about his relationships with a subordinate who killed himself after being embroiled in a scandal surrounding another development project.",
      "Under South Korean law, anyone who receives a fine exceeding 1 million won ($683) for election law violations is barred from running for elections for five years, and anyone who receives a prison sentence, including suspended sentences, cannot run for 10 years.",
      "Lee might be able to become president despite his conviction in lower-level courts, as the prohibition does not go into force until all appeals are exhausted and as president he would have immunity from most criminal prosecution. Still, observers say that if the appellate court had upheld his conviction it could have posed a significant political challenge.",
      "After the ruling, Lee appeared outside the court and thanked the court for making \u201ca right ruling based on truth and justices\u201d as his supporters shouted his name. Lee accused the Yoon government and state prosecutors of having fabricated evidence against him.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Multiple wildfires raging across South Korea\u2019s southern regions for days have killed 26 people and destroyed more than 300 structures, officials said, as thousands of personnel and dozens of helicopters were mobilized again Thursday to battle the the county\u2019s worst-ever blazes.",
      "Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said \u201ca small amount\u201d - less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) - of rain was expected in the area on Thursday, not enough to play a meaningful role in extinguishing the wildfires.",
      "The fatalities include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire and four firefighters and other workers who died after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds.",
      "Authorities haven't disclosed details of the civilian dead, except that they are mostly in their 60s and 70s. They suspect human error caused several of the wildfires that began last Friday, including cases where people started fires while clearing overgrown grass from family tombs or with sparks during welding work.",

Observers say that's the worst figure of its kind in South Korea. The report said the blazes have also injured nearly 30 people, destroyed about 320 buildings and structures and forced more than 24,200 people to evacuate.",

Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain as another fire spread closer.",

      "The South\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea has also been sending more missiles, artillery equipment and ammunition to help Russia and that North Korea could increase its weapons supplies further depending on the war situation. Russia and Ukraine recently agreed on a limited ceasefire, though both sides have accused each other of violations.",
      "The military equipment North Korea has sent to Russia includes a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of short-range ballistic missiles, 170 millimeter self-propelled howitzers and around 220 units of 240 millimeter multiple rocket launchers.",
      "North Korea has sent approximately 11,000 military personnel to fight in the war against Ukraine in its first involvement in a large-scale conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War, and the Joint Chiefs assessed that around 4,000 of them have been killed or wounded.",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service previously attributed the high North Korean casualties to the troops\u2019 likely struggles in adapting to drones and other elements of modern warfare. North Korean troops are further disadvantaged by the crude tactics of their Russian commanders, who have sent them into assault campaigns without providing rear-fire support, the spy agency told lawmakers in January.",
      "Still, Ukrainian military and intelligence officials have assessed that the North Koreans are gaining crucial battlefield experience and have been key to Russia\u2019s strategy of overwhelming Ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers into the battle for Kursk.",
      "The South Korean military report came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed his unwavering support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine during a meeting with a top Russian security official, Sergei Shoigu, last week in Pyongyang. State media reports said Kim and Shoigu reaffirmed their commitment to uphold a major mutual defense treaty agreed upon last year. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko told Russian media on Thursday that the governments were discussing a potential visit by Kim to Moscow but did not specify when it might take place.",
      "\u201cWe always talk to everyone about exchanging visits. We are always preparing,\u201d he told RIA Novosti.",
      "Kim\u2019s military support of Russia has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military. Experts say drones are among the potential areas where North Korea might seek to acquire Russian technology and know-how.",
      "North Korean state media said Thursday that Kim observed tests of newly developed reconnaissance and attack drones this week and called for their increased production. Kim in recent months has been emphasizing the development of drones, and the tests were the latest display of his country\u2019s growing military capabilities.",
      "Photos released by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency showed Kim observing what appeared to be a large reconnaissance drone roughly resembling Boeing\u2019s E-7 Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft. Other images showed exploding drones crashing into military vehicles used as targets.",
      "The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone\u2019s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones are designed for various attack missions and feature unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones\u2019 performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be \u201ctop\u201d priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Kim previously inspected other demonstrations of drones that explode on impact in November and August last year.",
      "When asked about the new reconnaissance drone, which North Korean state media unveiled for the first time, Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the North likely modified an existing aircraft to create an early-warning drone and may have used certain components from Russia. He said North Korea was possibly exaggerating the capabilities of the drone.",

      "Bolsonaro\u2019s defense team had requested the case to be sent to the full Supreme Court, not just on the 5-justice panel, which could drag a ruling into 2026 as all 11 justices would have their say on the case. The request was denied.",
      "Brazil\u2019s top court is using one of its two permanent 5-justice panels to put Bolsonaro on trial. None of the five was appointed by Bolsonaro.",
      "As rapporteur of the case, justice de Moraes brought the charges to the one he sits on.",
      "The other four justices are C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, considered one of the harshest on criminal cases; Cristiano Zanin, the chairman of the panel and Lula's attorney between 2013 and 2023; Fl\u00e1vio Dino, appointed by the leftist president in 2023 after serving as his justice minister; and Luiz Fux, the court's chief-justice between 2020 and 2022, considered a moderate.",
      "Brazilian criminal law mandates that arrests occur only after a final, unappealable conviction.",
      "The Supreme Court of Brazil, being the final appeals tribunal for criminal cases involving public authorities, possesses ultimate jurisdiction over Bolsonaro's case.",
      "If the former president takes any action that hampers the court\u2019s ability to deliver its ruling, such as seeking shelter in an embassy, he could be arrested before the trial ends.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has been banned from running for office until 2030 for abuse of power and undermining confidence in the country\u2019s voting system, has denied wrongdoing and claims he is the target of political persecution.",
      "\u201cIf I go to jail, I will give you a lot of work,\u201d Bolsonaro said after Wednesday's Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering by low court judge Sergio Moro in 2017, and had his sentence later upheld by a group of magistrates. He served more than a year and seven months in prison and was released after the Supreme Court changed its jurisprudence to forbid jail time for any Brazilian until all appeals are exhausted.",
      "In 2021, the same court annulled Lula's sentence as it found Moro to be biased. Moro left his position as a federal judge to become Bolsonaro's justice minister.",
      "Michel Temer, who governed between 2016 and 2018 after Dilma Rousseff was impeached, was acquitted by a federal court in 2024 in a corruption and money laundering case. He was briefly arrested in 2019 under the accusation of profiting from fraudulent contracts between state-run Eletronuclear and companies AF Consult Ltd and Engevix during his time as vice president.",
      "Fernando Collor, who governed between 1990 and his impeachment in 1992, was sentenced to eight years and ten months in jail in 2023 for his role in a corruption scheme at then state-run BR Distribuidora. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court last year, but Collor is yet to be imprisoned.",
      "The inclusion of high-ranking military officials to stand trial in Brazil's top court is unprecedented, as the country's transition from a military dictatorship to democracy in the 1980s was marked by a sweeping amnesty for military personnel.",
      "Four high-ranking military officials who operated under Bolsonaro will stand trial. These are former Defense Minister Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira; former Navy commander Almir Garnier Santos; retired Gen. Augusto Heleno, who headed the Institutional Security Office; and retired Gen. Walter Braga Netto, who served as Bolsonaro\u2019s chief of staff and defense minister.",
      "\"Four-star generals accused of plotting a coup are now likely to be convicted and punished under Brazil\u2019s democratic legal system,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Roberto Martins Filho, a political science professor at the Federal University of Sao Carlos and former president of the Brazilian Association of Defense Studies. \u201cAnyone who attempts a military-backed coup and fails could face consequences like what we\u2019re seeing now. They could end in prison.\u201d",

      "ISTANBUL -- Turkey\u2019s president on Wednesday accused the political opposition of \u201csinking the economy\u201d during the country\u2019s largest protests in more than a decade over the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor, the biggest challenger to Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule.",
      "The party of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has called for a boycott of companies that it says support Erdogan\u2019s government. The Turkish president accused the opposition of being \u201cso desperate that they would throw the country and the nation into the fire.\u201d",
      "In his address to lawmakers with his Justice and Development Party, or AKP, Erdogan added that \u201csabotage targeting the Turkish economy will be held accountable before the courts.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu was arrested a week ago. He faces charges related to corruption and supporting terrorism within the Istanbul municipality alongside some 90 other suspects. A court ordered him to be imprisoned Sunday. A trial date has not been announced.",
      "Many consider the case against Imamoglu to be politically motivated. The government says the judiciary is free of political influence.",
      "The evidence against Imamoglu has not been officially disclosed. Many Turkish media outlets have reported that it is largely based on \u201csecret witnesses.\u201d The use of such testimony has been seen in previous criminal cases against opposition politicians.",
      "The head the opposition Iyi Party, Musavat Dervisoglu, questioned the evidence of corruption in Istanbul municipality. \u201cDozens of inspectors have gone, 1,300 inspections have been made, nothing has come out of these inspections,\u201d he told party lawmakers.",
      "Also Wednesday, members of Istanbul\u2019s municipality were voting for a proxy mayor to stand in for Imamoglu. Imamoglu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, has a majority in the municipal assembly and was likely to select Nuri Aslan, the deputy mayor under Imamoglu.",
      "While the CHP has said it will no longer organize mass rallies at City Hall, students across Turkey continue protesting. Demonstrations in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, as well as smaller cities and towns, have been largely peaceful. Protesters demand Imamoglu\u2019s release and an end to democratic backsliding.",
      "Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya has said that 1,418 people have been detained in the past week over the protests.",
      "Egitim-Sen, a trade union representing teachers and university lecturers, said its Istanbul University representative was detained. Student leftist groups said some of their members were also detained at their homes.",
      "Turkey is not due for another election until 2028, but it's possible that Erdogan will call for an early vote to seek another term.",
      "Imamoglu has been confirmed as the candidate for the CHP and has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan. His election as mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in 2019 was a major blow to Erdogan and his party.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have been pouring into the medieval hilltop town of Assisi in Italy to venerate the Catholic Church\u2019s newest saint",
      "ASSISI, Italy -- Pilgrims have been pouring into this medieval hilltop town to venerate not only two of the Catholic Church\u2019s most celebrated saints, Francis and Clare, but its newest \u2014 Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint, who will be canonized on April 27.",
      "\u201cSt. Francis, St. Clare, of course, important saints who marked an epoch \u2013 but that\u2019s far removed from today\u2019s teens. Carlo is like the kids,\u201d said Maria Rosario Riccio, a mother and educator who was visiting Acutis\u2019 shrine recently with a 50-strong parish youth group from southern Italy. \u201cHe\u2019s a near-saint of our time, who can show teens that it\u2019s possible to love Jesus while being a regular youth.\u201d",
      "The group lined up to enter the Santuario della Spogliazione \u2014 a somber church, also known as Santa Maria Maggiore, marking the spot where more than 800 years ago St. Francis renounced his family\u2019s wealth. There, they prayed by the monument where Acutis\u2019 body is on view, wearing jeans, a sweatshirt and sneakers.",
      "On that Saturday, hundreds filed past \u2014 a priest and his parishioners from the Azores islands, a nun from Colombia and her Passionist sisters, a family with two teens from near Venice. Some clutched rosaries, others took selfies or touched the protective glass in front of the seemingly sleeping young man, who died of leukemia at 15 in 2006 and is generating a devotion that astonishes even Assisi\u2019s bishop.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m seeing here a volcano of grace erupting \u2026 I can\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d said the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino. When he became bishop two decades ago, the church next to his residence just off the main street was \u201cforgotten\u201d by the throngs that visited the monumental Basilica of St. Francis.",
      "Over the last year, more than a million pilgrims paid homage to Acutis, Sorrentino said, drawn by \u201chis smiling way of living our faith.\u201d",
      "The teen\u2019s happy image, usually in a red polo shirt and carrying a backpack, is as popular in souvenir shops across town as Francis in his simple brown habit.",
      "One store owner picked up a blessed icon the first time she went to the shrine and keeps it glued to her cash register.",
      "\u201cI was really curious about this new saint who attracts youth,\u201d Silvia Balducci said.",
      "Both the church and his family describe Acutis as an exceptionally devout but otherwise regular Italian boy, who\u2019s working miracles after his untimely death precisely by drawing youth to faith when most of his contemporaries are abandoning organized religion.",
      "\u201cCarlo wasn\u2019t an alien, he was a normal person. But if it\u2019s illuminated by the light of Christ, a life becomes extraordinary,\u201d his mom, Antonia Salzano Acutis, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe always pray to the saints, and in the end, what did saints do? They opened the doors of their lives to Christ.\u201d",
      "She quoted one of her son\u2019s favorite phrases: \u201c\u2019Everyone is born an original, but many die photocopies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe saint is one who didn\u2019t die like a photocopy, who realized that project of holiness that God established in eternity for each of us, as we all should,\u201d she said.",
      "Not an observant Catholic herself when she had him, Acutis used to joke with her husband that their young son was \u201ca little Buddha\u201d because of his unselfishness, attention to others, and cheerful obedience.",
      "He developed a precocious interest in faith, such as wanting to enter every church to \u201csay hi\u201d to Jesus and Mary. Later, he started attending Mass, adoring the Blessed Sacrament and praying the rosary daily \u2014 while also entertaining with jokes his friends who were less interested in religion and more into going to nightclubs with their girlfriends and smoking an occasional joint.",
      "\u201cThis was a bit of a way of hiding his faith life, because Carlo knew that his friends couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d his mother said. \u201cBut Carlo was a witness, a silent witness through the value of friendship, through the value of generosity, helping his classmates in school, defending the teens who were bullied.\u201d",
      "Acutis often helped the homeless and was uninterested in the trappings common for a wealthy child in Milan, one of Europe\u2019s fashion and business capitals. He asked his parents to donate to the poor what they would have spent for a second pair of sneakers for him, and insisted he wanted to teach catechism at his parish instead of going on skiing holidays at fancy resorts like his peers.",
      "That denial of privilege is a parallel with St. Francis, to whom Acutis was so devoted that he asked to be buried in Assisi, said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent most of his religious career there and heads the pontifical committee for World Children\u2019s Day.",
      "\u201cAnd there are more similarities with St. Francis. St. Francis left the churches and went to the squares to preach. Carlo Acutis prophetically realized that today the public squares are online, on the Web,\u201d Fortunato said. \u201cThat\u2019s where youth are, that\u2019s where people are, so he lives and brings the Gospel in those squares. That\u2019s one of the reasons why he will become the patron of the Web, Internet and social media.\u201d",
      "Particularly devout to the eucharist and wanting to share the Catholic belief that Jesus is literally present in it, Acutis created an online exhibit about miracles where the bread and wine became flesh and blood throughout the centuries. It\u2019s been used in thousands of parishes worldwide, his mother said.",
      "For her, his being \u201ca bridge to Jesus\u201d \u2014 even in his terminal illness, which he faced without complaining, certain of eternal life \u2014 is a more important legacy than any miracles or supernatural signs.",
      "To become a saint, however, miracles do need to be attested. One in Acutis\u2019 canonization process was the healing of a Costa Rican student from a bicycle accident in Italy after her mother prayed to him, Sorrentino said.",
      "Sabina Falcetta goes often to Acutis\u2019 shrine from the nearby city of Perugia with a group of fellow mothers to pray for their children.",
      "\u201cCarlo Acutis gives us peace,\u201d she said. \u201cMost importantly he gives us the certainty that God is a good father. And you can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d",
      "As she talked outside the sanctuary, a Confirmation group from Lake Garda in northern Italy was praying in a circle by a cutout of Acutis in his jeans and backpack standing by a larger-than-life monstrance.",
      "One of the catechists, Veronica Abraham, said she had been teaching about both St. Francis and Acutis, focusing on the teen\u2019s charity and his custom of sitting down to chat with anyone who looked lonely, \u201csince even a ciao is important for those who are alone.\u201d",
      "Her son Mario Girardi, 13, said he was really struck by the fact that Acutis \u2014 when only a couple of years older than him \u2014 \u201cspoke with everyone, didn\u2019t let anything bother him but helped everyone.\u201d",
      "While he\u2019s not considering the priesthood, Girardi does go to church every Sunday and plans to \u201calways stay in this mindset\u201d \u2014 maybe even going to daily Mass.",
      "Would he want to become a saint, too?",
      "\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope. Yes, right? Never say never, who knows,\u201d the boy said, grinning.",

      "Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe have gathered for talks in Paris about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia",
      "PARIS -- Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe gathered for talks in Paris on Thursday about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia, and to consider proposals to deploy European troops in the country in tandem with any peace deal.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on. Russian drone attacks overnight before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace injured more than 20 people, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead.",
      "France and Britain are pushing a separate initiative to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of a European armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again.",
      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow U.S. forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 British officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a picture from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",
      "Macron said Wednesday that the proposed European force could deploy to \u201cimportant towns, strategic bases\u201d in Ukraine and that it could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the frontlines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the frontlines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight injured at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a frontline community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe should not ease sanctions on Moscow.",
      "\u201cRussia is killing every day and prolonging this war,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media. \u201cThe American proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table for half a month now.\u201d",

      "NIAMEY, Niger -- Niger\u2019s junta leader, Abdourahamane Tchiani, was on Wednesday sworn in as the country\u2019s president for a transition period of five years under a new charter that replaces the West African nation\u2019s constitution. The move effectively rebuffed attempts by the regional bloc to quicken the return to democracy after a 2023 coup.",
      "The five-year \u201cflexible\u201d transition period begins on Wednesday, according to Mahamane Roufai, the secretary general of the government. He was speaking at a ceremony in the capital Niamey where the new transition charter recommended by a recent national conference was approved.",
      "Tchiani, an army veteran, was also elevated to the country\u2019s highest military rank of army general, cementing his grip on power since June 2023 when he led soldiers that deposed the country\u2019s elected government.",
      "The new president would have been in power for about seven years by the end of the transition period in 2030, following similar patterns of prolonged stints in power in Africa's junta-led countries, including Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.",
      "Niger's junta had initially proposed a three-year transition period right after the coup, but that was rejected by West Africa's regional bloc known as ECOWAS, which called it a provocation and threatened to intervene with the use of force.",
      "Since then Niger has left the bloc alongside Mali and Burkina Faso, in protest of harsh sanctions which the bloc announced to force a return to democracy in Niger.",
      "Critics say Niger's junta has clamped down on civil rights and struggled to end the jihadi violence that the military said inspired them to take power.",

      "South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulate...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The landmark report released Wednesday followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States, and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea\u2019s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and \u201980s.",
      "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government-appointed fact-finding panel, said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May.",
      "However, some adoptees and even a senior investigator on the commission criticized the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government\u2019s complicity.",
      "That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, a standing commissioner, also lamented the panel\u2019s decision-making committee\u2019s 5-4 vote on Tuesday to defer assessments of 42 other adoptees\u2019 cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission\u2019s conservative chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions.",
      "However, Lee implied that some committee members were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified \u2014 either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them.",
      "Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives.",
      "Lee said the commission\u2019s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I find yesterday\u2019s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,\u201d Lee said.",
      "After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children, including those born to poor parents or unwed mothers.",
      "Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea\u2019s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their possession and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in \"large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,\u201d the commission said.",
      "Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children\u2019s identities, according to the commission\u2019s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.",
      "The commission recommended the South Korean government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States \u2014 the largest recipient of Korean children by far \u2014 and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions, which have drawn growing international attention amid criticism that thousands of children were carelessly or unnecessarily separated from their biological families. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the government department that handles adoption issues, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the commission\u2019s report.",
      "Around 200,000 South Koreans were adopted to Western countries in the past seven decades, forming what\u2019s believed to be the world\u2019s largest diaspora of adoptees.",
      "Most were placed with white parents in the United States and Europe during the 1970-80s. South Korea's then military leaders focused on economic growth and saw adoptions as a tool to reduce welfare burdens, erase the \u201csocial problem\u201d of unwed mothers and deepen ties with the democratic West.",
      "The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to the heads of private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year.",
      "Recent reforms, including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight by requiring foreign adoptions to go through family courts, have led to a significant decline in the overseas placements of South Korean children, with only 79 cases in 2023.",

      "In a 12-page report, Human Rights Watch accused the rebels of executing unarmed farmers and forcibly recruiting dozens of children into their ranks. The group also called on Colombia\u2019s government to speed up investigations into homicides in Catatumbo, where at least 78 people were killed in January and February, after a truce ended between rebel groups in the area.",
      "\u201cOur research points to widespread abuses against ordinary people,\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director for HRW.",
      "According to the Colombian Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s Office, more than 56,000 people have been displaced from their homes in the Catatumbo region since Jan. 16, when the National Liberation Army, or ELN, launched a violent campaign to strengthen its grip on the area.",
      "Human Rights Watch said that in some villages, the rebels dragged people out of their homes and shot those who they accused of being collaborators of a rival group known as the FARC-EMC.",
      "Human Rights Watch interviewed 65 people for its investigation, including judicial officials, aid workers and displaced farmers.",
      "\u201cIt seems that the ELN is trying to control the border with Venezuela, partly due to the drug trade,\u201d said Juan Pappier, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Americas. \u201cAnd for that they\u2019ve long benefited from the complicity of Venezuelan security forces.\u201d",
      "Some people who fled the Catatumbo region told Human Rights Watch that the ELN executed farmers in front of their families.",
      "Others accused the FARC-EMC group of running forced labor camps, where local people who were accused of committing crimes were forced to cut sugar cane for more than 12 hours a day.",
      "Human Rights Watch urged Colombia\u2019s Attorney General's office to increase the number of prosecutors and investigators in the Catatumbo region, and to provide protection for them, so that these crimes can be further investigated.",
      "The Colombian government suspended peace talks with the ELN on Jan. 20, after news emerged of the ELN\u2019s attacks on several villages in Catatumbo.",
      "President Gustavo Petro, who was a member of a rebel group during his youth, has accused the ELN\u2019s leadership of becoming \u201cgreedy\u201d drug traffickers and of abandoning their revolutionary ideals.",
      "Violence decreased in Colombia following a 2016 peace deal with the nation\u2019s largest rebel group, FARC, in which more than 13,000 fighters laid down their weapons.",
      "But some isolated areas, including the Catatumbo region, have seen an uptick in homicides, extorsion and forced displacement, as smaller groups fight for control of territories abandoned by the FARC.",
      "The National Liberation Army, has an estimated 6,000 fighters in Venezuela and Colombia, according to Colombia\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",

      "KINGSTON, Jamaica -- Weaning Caribbean countries from their dependence on Venezuelan oil and combating illegal immigration will top U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s tour of three Caribbean nations this week as the Trump administration increasingly focuses its attention on the Western Hemisphere.",
      "The State Department said Rubio, who arrived in Jamaica on Wednesday, will push for the region to diversify its energy supplies. Rubio also will visit Guyana and Suriname, his visit coming just days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and threatened tariffs on all goods imported into the United States by other countries that buy oil from Venezuela.",
      "Another main issue for Rubio will be the situation in Haiti, where a multinational peacekeeping force has been in place for months struggling to prevent gangs from taking over the country. Rubio spoke Tuesday with the president of Kenya, which is leading that force, although the State Department account of the call made no reference to Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, obviously, is Haiti,\u201d said Mauricio Claver-Caron, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Western Hemisphere. \u201cAnd, obviously, we all know and we share the deep commitment to tackling this challenge in Haiti.\u201d",

Rubio has extended waivers on an overall U.S. foreign aid freeze to continue to fund the security force in Haiti, but it remains unclear how long they will last.",
      "\u201cThis trip is going to add in the urgency of the moment and in the urgency of the situation to the development and implementation of a very targeted strategy in regards to Haiti to try to ensure that these gangs do not take over, obviously, Port-au-Prince but then expand beyond that,\u201d Claver-Caron said without elaborating.",
      "Energy, he said, will be the top topic of conversation while Rubio is in the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cWe are in a historic moment in the Caribbean for energy security, which has been the Achilles' heel of the Caribbean for so long and its economic development with disproportionately high electricity and energy prices,\u201d Claver-Caron said.",

      "On Monday, Trump announced he was tightening U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and would slap a 25% tariff on all goods sent to the U.S. by countries that import Venezuelan oil on April 2. But just hours later, the Treasury Department said it would extend a sanctions waiver for the U.S. company Chevron to continue to send Venezuelan oil to the United States until the end of May.",
      "\u201cThe fact that now their own countries \u2014 Guyana, Suriname \u2014 are able to have and really surpass Venezuela in its oil production and be able to work with its neighbors there in the region is a huge opportunity for the Caribbean,\" Claver-Caron said.",
      "He also suggested the U.S. was prepared to field questions from regional leaders about U.S. sanctions on Cuba that target programs that send doctors and nurses to the region and elsewhere. American officials have said the programs resemble organized human trafficking because the medical professionals are not paid directly.",
      "Latin American leaders have denounced the U.S. sanctions, saying they deprive their people of much needed medical assistance, but Claver-Caron dismissed those complaints and said if the leaders Rubio meets with focus on that, it will be a waste of time.",
      "\u201cIf they choose to overshadow this trip with the issue of Cuban doctors, it\u2019ll be a lost opportunity, because again, the huge opportunity here is energy security, economic development that has plagued this region, and the biggest challenge that we have is Haiti,\u201d he said.",

      "There was no word of any immediate progress, but both sides sounded positive on the state of relations.",
      "Barrot met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who said in a news conference afterward that both countries should \u201cchoose multilateralism over unilateralism ... and pursue mutual benefit and win-win outcomes instead of decoupling and isolation.\u201d",

      "Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.",
      "But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. A recent study released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.",
      "The amount of these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.",
      "\u201cThey are very widespread,\u201d said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they're not in all biosolids and sometimes it's only in small amounts, he added.",
      "Here's how they're made:",
      "At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.",
      "After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.",
      "The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.",
      "The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.",
      "After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for land-applied biosolids.",
      "\u201cThere are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,\u201d including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.",
      "Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.",
      "The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what\u2019s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.",
      "The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.",
      "In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.",
      "The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn't test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.",

      "National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy emphasized to Congress Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration had data going back to 2011 showing that collision alarms were sounding inside cockpits at least once a month because of how close the planes were getting to helicopters. But the FAA didn't act, she said.",
      "\u201cAll this data is being collected by FAA from operators, from others, from voluntary reporting systems. Where is that data going to trend potential accidents and incidents in the future?\u201d Homendy said during a hearing on her agency's budget. \u201cThe next accident is in the data right now. And what are we doing to figure out what that is?\u201d",
      "The Senate is planning another hearing Thursday to delve deeper into what the NTSB has found so far about the Jan. 29 midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., Ronald Reagan National Airport. Homendy and the leaders of the FAA and Army's aviation division will all testify.",
      "Both Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month when NTSB first disclosed the shocking statistics that they were angry that the FAA didn't recognize the dangers before this crash after 85 near misses in the past three years when aircraft flew within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other.",
      "The FAA promptly launched a review of all its data after the NTSB briefing to try to identify any similar safety threats, particularly in eight cities with heavy helicopter traffic. The FAA said Wednesday that analysis continues.",
      "That review \u2014 aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 is focused on airports in Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles and the heavy helicopter traffic off the Gulf Coast. The FAA hasn't said whether it has found anything yet, but the agency promised it \u201cwill have corrective action plans for any risks that are identified.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, the FAA quickly adopted the NTSB's recommendation to permanently close off a particular helicopter route near Reagan anytime planes are taking off or landing on the airport's runway 33 that the jetliner was approaching in January when the collision happened. If a helicopter does need to use that route for an urgent reason, no planes will be allowed to take off or land. That should ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace near the airport, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe FAA will continue to closely support the NTSB-led investigation and take action as necessary to ensure public safety,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Homendy declined Wednesday to address President Donald Trump's comments right after the crash suggesting that diversity and inclusion policies at the FAA may have contributed to it because the NTSB investigation isn't complete. A final report identifying the cause isn't expected for more than year. Trump also faulted the helicopter for flying too high and later suggested that an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system was the problem.",
      "New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said it is important to refute those diversity comments now because nothing has been found so far to support them, and she doesn't want the public to get the idea that diversity is the problem.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, loyalty and sycophants seems to be the order of the day, and it\u2019s definitely negatively impacting this federal government doing its job,\u201d Watson Coleman said during the hearing.",
      "Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.",
      "The NTSB previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The helicopter was at 278 feet (85 meters) at the time of the collision, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",

      "Major anti-abortion groups are gathering in the nation's capital to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood",
      "WASHINGTON -- Major anti-abortion groups were gathering in the nation's capital on Thursday to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump's administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood ahead of the Supreme Court hearing a case in April that could strip the organization's funding in South Carolina.",
      "The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider.",
      "\u201cThis event begins an intensive round of outreach to the GOP, calling on them to take advantage of this unique moment to defund the abortion industry,\u201d Students for Life, the national anti-abortion group organizing the event, said in a statement.",
      "The Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization\u2019s 2023 report. Planned Parenthood also provides other forms of reproductive health care, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, often for low-income patients.",
      "Vicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood\u2019s South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is \u201can attempt to mislead the public\u201d and emphasized Planned Parenthood\u2019s role in providing broader reproductive health care.",
      "\u201cWe should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,\u201d Ringer said.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University's Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump\u2019s presidential victory and by his fellow Republicans winning control of Congress in November.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,\" she said.",
      "The Supreme Court announced it would hear a case involving South Carolina's attempt to strip Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization's funding.",
      "Almost 100 conservative members of Congress signed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to side with South Carolina. The state already bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "In February, a panel of judges in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that attempted to force Planned Parenthood to repay millions of dollars of Medicaid funding in Texas and Louisiana.",
      "If the Supreme Court sides with South Carolina, Rebouche said, there may be a wider impact on health care by \"giving states broad power to exclude health care that is unpopular or politically disfavored,\u201d such as contraception. Targeting Planned Parenthood might also have a negative effect on maternal and infant mortality rates and could cost more money in the long run by cutting off low-income patients from vital preventive reproductive health care, she said.",
      "During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina \u2014 have introduced bills this year aiming to create tax breaks for anti-abortion centers.",
      "The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict medication abortion access nationwide.",
      "Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves after waffling on the issue on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning assistance. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related to fetal personhood in an executive order rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "The Republican president has appointed abortion opponents in some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans.",
      "Advocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump's Department of Justice will revive the Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, and her confirmation was celebrated by abortion opponents.",

The U.S. is the biggest destination for Japanese car exports.",
      "\u201cI am very concerned about the behavior of the American government,\u201d Lula said. \u201cI am concerned because free trade is being harmed and I am concerned because multilateralism is weakened,\u201d Lula said through an interpreter.",

      "The U.S. trade surplus with Brazil was $7.4 billion in 2024, nearly a 32% increase over a year earlier. Brazil's top exports to the U.S. were petroleum and iron and steel. Its biggest imports from the U.S. were crude and refined oil, gas turbines, aircraft, chemical and machinery.",

      "The news came as President Donald Trump planned to announce tariffs on auto imports at the White House. Hyundai will be spared from those tariffs on its U.S.-made vehicles. Trump praised the South Korean automaker on Monday, saying its American investments are \u201ca clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work.\u201d",
      "Hyundai began producing EVs just shy of six months ago at its sprawling manufacturing plant in southeast Georgia. More than 1,200 people are working there.",
      "With employees in blue shirts filling bleachers behind him Wednesday, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chairman Euisun Chung said the company plans to increase the plant's capacity from 300,000 vehicles per year to 500,000. He said it shows Hyundai has come to Georgia \u201cto stay, to invest and to grow.\u201d",
      "\u201cStanding here today, I can say I have never been more confident about building the future of mobility with America, in America,\" Chung said.",
      "Hyundai Motor Company CEO Jose Munoz said the Georgia expansion was \u201clike building a new plant.\u201d",
      "Hyundai employees worked the assembly line Wednesday alongside hundreds of robots that stamp sheets of steel into fenders and door panels, weld and paint auto bodies and even park finished vehicles awaiting their final inspections.",
      "The plant that sprawls across 3,000 acres churns out a finished vehicle about once a minute. Its 1,200 workers are currently producing two electric SUV models \u2014 the Ioniq 5 and the larger Ioniq 9.",
      "The newly announced Georgia expansion is part of $21 billion in U.S. investments over the next three years that Hyundai announced at the White House with Trump on Monday. They also include a $5.8 billion steel mill in Louisiana to produce auto parts for Hyundai's assembly plants in Georgia and Alabama.",
      "Chung told Trump at the White House: \u201cWe are really proud to stand with you and proud to build the future together.\u201d",
      "Before the expansion was announced, Hyundai and battery-making partner LG Energy Solution said they plan to employ 8,500 total workers at the Bryan County site, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Savannah. Hyundai didn't immediately say whether more workers would be hired.",
      "During the first half of 2024, the Ioniq 5 was America\u2019s second-best-selling electric vehicle not made by industry leader Tesla.",
      "Hyundai took less than two years to start making EVs in Georgia after breaking ground in the fall of 2022. It was the largest economic development project the state had ever seen, and it came with a whopping $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives from the state and local governments.",
      "EVs accounted for 8.1% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. last year, up from 7.9% in 2023, according to Motorintelligence.com.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is supporting the conservative candidate in the race to fill a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which could ultimately decide a Tesla lawsuit",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk and political groups he backs are pouring millions of dollars into the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court as the electric vehicle company sues to overturn a state law that prevents it from opening dealerships \u2014 a case that eventually could make its way to the high court.",
      "Tesla's multiple attempts to open its own dealerships in Wisconsin keep running up against a state law that allows only third parties, not auto manufacturers, to operate them. The company filed a lawsuit in January seeking an exemption, just as two Musk-backed political action committees started supporting the Republican-backed candidate, Brad Schimel, over his opponent, Susan Crawford, who is supported by Democrats.",
      "Musk, who is the world's wealthiest person and is running President Donald Trump's initiative to slash the size of the federal workforce, has given $3 million to the Wisconsin GOP while groups he supports have funneled more than $17 million into the race. The contributions are part of an extraordinary spending spree in the race, making it by far the most expensive judicial race on record in the U.S. Total spending has eclipsed $80 million with days still to go before the final day of voting on April 1.",
      "Schimel's critics have accused Musk of trying to buy a favorable ruling for Tesla should the dealership case make it to the state Supreme Court. Here are details of the law and Musk's lawsuit:",
      "State statutes generally prohibit vehicle manufacturers from owning or operating dealerships in Wisconsin and give that franchise to third parties. The law was intended to prevent manufacturers from undercutting independent dealerships.",
      "Nearly 20 states have similar prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The laws took hold in the 1930s as carmakers started to rely on independent dealerships to sell and service vehicles so they could focus on production. Later, independent dealers wanted to prevent manufacturers from opening their own dealerships and driving them out of business.",
      "Tesla sells its vehicles directly to consumers, who can have their vehicles shipped directly to them or to dealerships in 27 states. Because the company can't set up its own dealerships in Wisconsin, buyers there must have the cars delivered to them or travel to dealerships in neighboring Minnesota or Illinois to pick them up.",
      "Tesla officials have been working for almost a decade to secure an exemption from the law. Republican legislators introduced bills in 2017 and 2021 that would permit Tesla dealerships, but none of those made it out of the Legislature. They inserted an exemption for Tesla dealerships into the 2019-21 state budget, but Democratic Gov. Tony Evers used his partial veto powers to erase the provision.",
      "The Wisconsin Automobile and Truck Dealers Association has been fighting to preserve the law. Bill Sepic, the association's president and CEO, told The Associated Press that Tesla should have to follow the law like any other vehicle manufacturer. He said the statutes exist to enable third parties to act as consumer advocates \u201cin making one of the larger purchases of their life.\u201d",
      "Tesla filed a lawsuit in state court in January seeking permission to open four dealerships in Wisconsin.",
      "The company argues that independent dealers wouldn't meet its standards and says selling vehicles at its own dealerships is in the public interest because unaffiliated dealers' prices are higher and less transparent.",
      "Its lawsuit says that the state law barring manufacturers from running their own dealerships violates economic liberty rights and that the prohibition exists only to protect independent dealers from competition.",
      "The case is pending in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, though no hearings have been scheduled.",
      "The state Justice Department is defending the law. An agency spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Schimel, the conservative state Supreme Court candidate, is vying with Crawford for an open seat on the high court.",
      "The race is the most significant election nationally since the November presidential contest, providing an early barometer for Republicans and Democrats given the intense interest and outside spending it has generated. It also will determine whether the highest court in the perennial presidential battleground state will flip from liberal to conservative control with major cases involving abortion, union rights and congressional redistricting on the horizon.",
      "Eight days after Tesla filed the Wisconsin dealership lawsuit, Musk tweeted: \u201cVery important to vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\u201d",
      "To be clear, there has been no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Wisconsin. Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the state over then-President Donald Trump in 2020 was affirmed by a recount and an independent audit. Trump, a Republican, won the state last November and offered no objections then to the voting or ballot-counting.",
      "According to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice, Musk-backed groups America PAC and Building America's Future have spent more than $17 million to support Schimel with ads and flyers. The money he donated to the state Republican Party has been used to help Schimel, who has been endorsed by Trump.",
      "Crawford's supporters contend the timing of the contributions show Musk is trying to ensure that Schimel wins and creates a conservative majority on the court that ultimately would rule in Tesla's favor. Crawford said during a debate with Schimel this month that Musk \u201chas basically taken over Brad Schimel's campaign.\u201d",
      "Sepic, president of the state dealership association, said Wisconsin should elect the candidate who enforces the prohibition but declined to comment when asked if he thought Schimel or Crawford would do that.",
      "Schimel has repeatedly said he would treat any case involving Tesla the same as any other when he considers whether to hear it or recuse himself. Schimel also has insisted that the donations from Musk and his groups do not make him beholden to them.",
      "Crawford has said the same thing about billionaires who have donated to her campaign, including George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Soros has contributed $2 million and Pritzker $1.5 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, which has funneled the money to Crawford\u2019s campaign.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A House Republican pushing the Trump administration's government efficiency efforts called for dismantling and defunding the nation's public broadcasting system following a contentious hearing Wednesday featuring the heads of PBS and NPR.",
      "\u201cWe believe that you all can hate us on your own dime,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.",
      "Coupled with President Donald Trump's declaration on Tuesday that he would \u201clove to\u201d see federal funding cut off, the nation's public broadcasting system is facing perhaps the biggest threat to its existence since it was first established in 1967. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "Republicans have frequently grumbled that PBS and NPR news programming leans left, but efforts to cut or eliminate funding usually fade because legislators want to protect their local stations \u2014 336 of them for PBS alone, with those in rural areas most heavily dependent on taxpayer money.",
      "The hearings on behalf of the new administration are one of multiple front on which Trump and his allies are aggressively challenging and in some cases sanctioning the American media, which the president has been sharply critical of for years. This week alone, he denounced The Atlantic repeatedly for publishing texts from the Signal messaging app among high-ranking defense official planning a military attack.",
      "A succession of GOP lawmakers on Wednesday complained bitterly about alleged bias, particularly from NPR stations, making clear it was not an issue that was going away quietly.",
      "Kentucky Rep. James Comer said that as a young farmer decades ago he would frequently listen to NPR broadcasts on his tractor, as it was often his only option. But now, he has podcasts and other things to listen to.",
      "\u201cI don't even recognize the station anymore,\u201d Comer said. \u201cIt's not news. It feels like it's propaganda. I feel like it's disinformation every time I listen to NPR.\u201d",
      "Greene displayed a picture of what she called a \u201cdrag queen\u201d that appeared on a PBS program geared to children and complained about documentaries featuring transgender people. PBS chief executive Paula Kerger said the \u201cdrag queen\u201d reference was about something mistakenly put on the New York PBS station's website and never on the air. The transgender people appeared as part of adult programming that reflected the experiences of different Americans, she said.",
      "Democrats characterized the hearing as a distraction from more important issues, like this week's revelation that a journalist from the Atlantic was included in a text chain of Trump administration officials detailing a U.S. military strike in Yemen. \u201cIf shame was still a thing, this hearing would be shameful,\u201d said Massachusetts Rep. Stephen Lynch.",
      "Some Democrats tried comedy. California Rep. Robert Garcia asked if the red \u201cSesame Street\u201d character, \u201cis Elmo now, or has he ever been, a member of the Communist Party?\u201d",
      "\u201cHe's a puppet,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cBut, no.\u201d",
      "The broadcasting leaders acknowledged mistakes.",
      "NPR President Katherine Maher said the radio network was wrong to dismiss what was on Hunter Biden's laptop as a non-story. After they were repeatedly referenced by Republicans on the committee, Maher said she regretted posting some anti-Trump tweets before she began working for NPR.",
      "Although saying she is not responsible for editorial content, Maher detailed efforts by NPR to ensure a variety of political viewpoints are represented. NPR's weekly listenership declined from 60 million to 42 million between 2020 and 2024, according to internal documents published by The New York Times, although Maher said Wednesday those numbers have inched up in the past year.",
      "\u201cI do not believe we are politically biased,\u201d Maher said. \u201cWe are a non-biased organization.\u201d",
      "Uri Berliner, a former NPR editor who quit last year after complaining the news outlet had become too one-sided, wrote in the Free Press on Wednesday that NPR should no longer accept taxpayer money so it can \u201cdrop the public from its mission statement and embrace the progressive.\"",
      "\u201cDon't try to conceal what everyone knows already,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Republican committee members noted that NPR has cited Wednesday's hearing in fundraising appeals and Maher was asked whether the system would survive without public money. \u201cIt would be incredibly damaging to the national public radio system,\u201d she said.",
      "Kerger emphasized the service that PBS provides to local communities, particularly with its educational programming for children, and said she is worried for the future of its smaller stations.",

      "ATSUGI, Japan -- The chief-executive-to-be at money-losing Japanese automaker Nissan is determined to speed up decision-making to come up with models that say Nissan \u2014 and really sell.",
      "Ivan Espinosa, 46, chief planning officer and a Mexican with two decades of experience at Nissan Motor Corp., told reporters in embargoed comments for Wednesday that the company's corporate culture is \u201clacking empathy\u201d and has to change.",
      "\u201cWe need to work together as one single team,\u201d he said at the Nissan Technical Center in Atsugi city on the outskirts of Tokyo. \u201cWe need to work together hand in hand.\u201d",
      "Nissan recently appointed Espinosa to take its helm, effective April 1, replacing Makoto Uchida.",
      "Espinosa has his work cut out for him as the maker of the Sentra sedan and Infiniti luxury cars faces yet another crisis, which began decades ago when Carlos Ghosn was sent in by French alliance partner Renault to save it from the brink of bankruptcy.",
      "Ghosn was arrested by Japanese authorities in 2018 on financial misconduct allegations but jumped bail and is now in Lebanon.",
      "Uchida, chief since 2019 when Ghosn\u2019s successor Hiroto Saikawa resigned over a separate money scandal, stepped down after the company projected a loss for the fiscal year through March.",
      "Espinosa expressed an openness to partnerships, including with parties outside the auto industry, although he declined to give specifics.",
      "Nissan recently ditched talks with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. to set up a joint holding company. They will continue to cooperate on technology development.",
      "Espinosa repeatedly came back to the importance of being nimble. New cars will be developed in 37 months, and offshoot models within 30 months, he said.",
      "Auto production, starting with design and culminating in product tests, takes several years. Bringing a product to market in 30 months would be relatively quick for the industry.",
      "To showcase its turnaround plans, Nissan showed an array of models rolling out in the next two years for the U.S., Europe, Japan and other markets, some of them as mockup models.",
      "Espinosa and other officials promised a lineup that highlights Nissan\u2019s legacy, like the Leaf electric car, and models that sell in greater volumes. It\u2019s also bringing out various ecological models, like hybrids, plug-ins and electric vehicles, and cutting-edge technology like self-driving cars.",
      "When announcing his replacement, Uchida called Espinosa \u201ca car guy.\u201d",
      "Espinosa, who drives a Z sportscar, Nissan\u2019s flagship nameplate, said he saw himself as \u201ca car lover.\u201d He loves the stories behind each car, he said, like how it\u2019s developed and becomes loved by customers.",
      "Analysts have so far taken a cautious approach to Espinosa\u2019s appointment. As an insider, he takes up where Uchida left off, meaning the verdict is still out.",
      "\u201cWe view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy, once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d CreditSights analysts Todd Duvick and Will Lee wrote in a recent commentary.",

      "\u201cTarget would have been a great boost to our business\u2019s growth,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just find it elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Target's stance has created a dilemma for brand founders with existing distribution deals. One is Play Pits, a natural deodorant for children that Maryland resident Chantel Powell launched in 2021. The product is found in about 360 Target stores.",
      "The retailer's DEI program \u201callowed us to employ amazing people, give back to our community, and exhibit Black excellence on and off the shelves,\u201d Powell wrote on LinkedIn as civil rights leaders talked about boycotting Target.",
      "She and some other product creators highlighted the impact boycotts might have on their businesses. They urged upset customers to intentionally limit their purchases to items from Black-owned enterprises. Some activists understood; others pushed the brands to join the protest by cutting ties with Target.",
      "\u201cThe conversation around Black brands, that they should pull out of the retailers that they\u2019re in, is unrealistic,\u201d Powell said this month as a 40-day, church-organized Target boycott was underway. \u201cWe signed up to be in business. I understand why people are having that conversation of boycotts. As a Black founder, I also understand the side of how it can be detrimental.\u201d",
      "The owner of a Black-owned sexual wellness business with its own line of condoms has a slightly different take. Target started carrying B Condoms in 2020, and founder Jason Panda said the company told him late last year that it didn't intend to keep the prophylactics in the 304 stores that stocked them.",
      "Panda says he isn't worried. The product is available through Amazon and in more than 7,000 CVS stores, he said. What's more, contracts with non-profit organizations and local governments that distribute condoms for free are the cornerstone of the business he established in 2011, Panda said.",
      "\u201cMy money has never really come from mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're going to be protected as long as I can maintain my relationship with my community.\u201d",
      "Brianna Arps, who founded the fragrance brand Moodeaux in 2021, notices fewer grants available to Black brand creators these days. She used to apply for 10 to 15 every week or two; the number is down to five to seven, Arps said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the organizations that had been really vocal about supporting (Black businesses) have either quietly or outwardly pulled back,\u201d she said.",
      "Moodeaux was the first Black-owned perfume brand to get its perfumes into Urban Outfitters and Credo Beauty, which specializes in natural vegan products. In the current environment, Arps is looking to expand her brand's presence independent shops and to support other Black fragrance lovers.",
      "\u201cThe resiliency of brands like ours and founders like myself will still exist,\u201d she said.",
      "Aurora James, the founder of the Fifteen Percent Pledge, said nearly 30 major companies that joined the initiative remain committed to it, including Bloomingdale's, beauty retailer Sephora, J. Crew and Gap.",
      "Ulta Beauty, another pledge signatory, and Credo Beauty carry Pound Cake products. Velazquez and Belle want to use social media to direct their followers to support retailers like Ulta and to bolster their online sales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fostering the community that we have and growing that,\u201d Velazquez said.",
      "While making a strategic decision \u201cto appeal to a broader audience\u201d when selecting puzzles for Barnes & Noble, Chambers said she plans to introduce Black faces and experiences to the chain's bookstores over time, in boxes of 500, 750 and 1,000 pieces.",
      "In the meantime, Puzzles of Color expanded its \u201cPride\u201d collection as a response to the DEI backlash. The subjects include Harriet Tubman, a mother and daughter tending a garden, and a little girl in a beauty supply store gazing up at hair accessories.",
      "\u201cDo we lean in all the way?\" Chambers asks herself. \"Part of why we started this was because we didn\u2019t see enough Black people in puzzles.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Copper prices have hit record highs as an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its key trading partners threatens to squeeze supplies of the vital metal.",
      "Buyers in the U.S. have been stocking up on copper ahead of potential tariffs. Future prices for the base metal hit $5.21 per pound on Tuesday. Prices are up about 30% so far this year, following modest gains over the last several years.",
      "President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a tariff of up to 25% on all copper imports and has called for increasing U.S. production. China, the world's largest importer of copper, is embarking on a stimulus program that could further increase demand for the base metal.",
      "\u201cTariff threats, tightening supply, and stimulus-fueled optimism for an economic rebound in China have underpinned a rally in copper.\u201d said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.",
      "Copper is critical to energy infrastructure around the world. It goes into cords for electronic devices, transmission lines, batteries, and LED lights. A global shift to cleaner energy technology, such as solar power, had already been boosting demand, which is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the uses of copper in today\u2019s economy, those uses and the intensity of use of copper in today\u2019s economy are growing,\u201d said Kathleen L. Quirk, President and CEO of mining giant Freeport-McMoRan, at a recent conference for the global metals industry.",
      "The International Energy Agency expects demand for the base metal to rise 20% to 31,128 kilotons by 2030 and by 41% to 36,379 kilotons by 2040. The U.S. mined about 1.1 million tons of copper in 2024. It currently lags the top producers, including Chile, Peru and China.",
      "Copper mining companies are gaining ground amid rising demand. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan, which operates most of its open-pit copper mines in the U.S., are up 12% this year. Southern Copper, which has operations in Mexico and Peru, is up 8% for the year. The broader market has been slipping, with the S&P 500 down about 2%.",
      "The rising price of copper has a potential downside for some businesses and consumers.",
      "The construction industry, including homebuilders, could face a tighter financial squeeze because of copper's rising cost as demand fails to keep pace with supplies. Stubborn inflation has already pushed home construction costs higher. Total construction costs for a single-family home rose just under 9.2% in 2024 from the previous year, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. Higher copper prices, coupled with higher prices for other key building materials such as lumber, could worsen inflation for the sector.",
      "Appliances, electronics and other products containing copper could become more expensive, also fueling inflation and prompting consumers to cut back on spending for certain items.",

      "A three-row SUV is ideal for car shoppers who need extra space for transporting lots of people and plenty of cargo",
      "A three-row crossover SUV can be a great choice for car shoppers who need extra room to shuttle plenty of people and cargo. The latest models are impressively capable and come loaded with up-to-date technology features. But they\u2019re also expensive and potentially out of reach for many shoppers. You\u2019re looking at spending approximately $50,000 to get a well-equipped new three-row SUV.",
      "This is why the automotive experts at Edmunds have compiled five of the best used three-row SUVs that come without the eye-widening price tag. Using a variety of online search portals, Edmunds tracked down 3-year-old vehicles that you can easily get for under $30,000.",
      "Some of the most popular three-row SUVs will be out of reach when you aim to stay below the $30,000 cap and find a vehicle that\u2019s only a few years old. But the five used three-row SUVs featured here are all nicely equipped and should provide years of dutiful service. The following prices are approximate based on vehicles listed for sale on Edmunds.",
      "The 2022 Chevrolet Traverse is a spacious and family-friendly midsize SUV, prioritizing comfort and practicality. Its generous passenger and cargo space makes it ideal for road trips and hauling duties. Powered by a V6 producing 310 horsepower, the Traverse delivers adequate acceleration for everyday driving. The EPA estimates the Traverse gets up to 21 mpg in combined city/highway driving.",
      "Inside, the Traverse offers a straightforward and user-friendly layout. The third row is notably more accommodating than many in its class. Cargo capacity behind the third row is also a strong point. However, the Traverse can seem a bit unwieldy to drive, and the thick rear roof pillars can block your view out of the back.",
      "2022 Chevrolet Traverse average price: $28,300",
      "The Sorento benefits from a 2021 redesign that brought new styling and a roomier interior. A punchy 281-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder is available, but finding a Sorento that\u2019s equipped with it for a sub-$30,000 budget could be difficult. The standard 191-horsepower four-cylinder gets the job done and gets up to an EPA-estimated 26 mpg combined.",
      "Edmunds noted that the Sorento has impressive interior space. There is adult-friendly legroom in both the second and third rows. Another feather in the cap of the Sorento is a fantastic 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, which provides extra peace of mind for used-SUV shoppers.",
      "2022 Kia Sorento average price: $28,500",
      "The CX-9 is a rare midsize SUV that is equal parts practical and fun to drive. Edmunds praises the CX-9 for its athletic handling and the lively acceleration from its 227-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder. Starting with the 2022 model year, Mazda made all-wheel drive standard. Fuel economy is an EPA-estimated 23 mpg.",
      "If you covered the badge on the steering wheel, the interior could fool you into thinking you\u2019d climbed aboard a luxury SUV. All controls are within easy reach and the materials used are top-notch. Life in the third row, unfortunately, isn\u2019t quite as opulent. Space back there is on the smallish side for a midsize SUV.",
      "2022 Mazda CX-9 average price: $28,400",
      "Until a complete redesign for the 2022 model year, the Outlander had been an SUV also-ran. This latest Outlander has plenty of underlying substance to match its bold style. For example, most Outlanders come with an 8-inch touchscreen with smartphone compatibility, rear cross-traffic alert, and a power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat. Edmunds found the Outlander to be comfortable and smooth to drive during testing.",
      "Acceleration is slow from the 181-horsepower four-cylinder, but you do get up to an EPA-estimated 27 mpg in combined driving. Edmunds noted the third row is small and best suited for kids. Yet, since so few small SUVs have this extra seating, having it still gives the Outlander an advantage over many rivals.",
      "2022 Mitsubishi Outlander average price: $24,800",
      "The 2022 Volkswagen Atlas prioritizes interior space and practicality, making it a strong contender for families needing a roomy three-row SUV. Highlights include lots of cargo space, a third-row seat big enough for adults, and a smooth ride over bumps. An easy-to-use infotainment system and helpful driver aids are also part of the Atlas\u2019 appeal.",
      "Power comes from either a 235-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder or an available 276-horsepower V6. We recommend getting the more satisfying V6 if you can. The EPA estimates the V6 gets up to 20 mpg combined.",
      "2022 Volkswagen Atlas average price: $29,600",
      "As these five vehicles prove, staying under a $30,000 budget isn\u2019t an impossible task when searching for a well-equipped and lightly used SUV. Some are more generous in terms of third-row space than others, so consider climbing back there an essential part of any test drive.",

      "European markets opened mostly lower, with Germany's DAX down 0.6% to 22,973.53. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.6% to 8,057.88, while Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.2% higher.",

      "Later this week, the U.S. is due to report on economic growth, personal spending, orders of durable goods and other key data.",
      "On Tuesday, the S&P 500 added 0.2% after jumping 1.8% Monday to one of its best days of the past year, lifted by hopes that tariff increases might not be as sweeping as earlier feared.. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.5%.",
      "U.S. stocks have recovered a chunk of their losses  since falling 10% below their all-time high  earlier this month, in their first \u201ccorrection\u201d since 2023. The S&P 500 is down 6% from its record, and that drop has left the market looking less expensive than before, which had been a major criticism following its euphoric rise in earlier years.",
      "But strategists along Wall Street warn that more sharp swings are still likely on the way with an April 2  deadline looming. That\u2019s what Trump has called \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when he will begin tariffs on trading partners that he says will roughly equal what he sees as the burden each of them puts on the United States.",
      "Even if Trump\u2019s tariffs do end up being less painful for the global economy than feared, all the dizzying talk about them has already soured confidence among U.S. households and businesses. The fear is that could lead them to cut back on their spending and freeze the economy.",
      "A report on Tuesday showed that pessimism among U.S. households is only worsening. The Conference Board\u2019s measure of consumer confidence fell by more than expected, mostly because of a tumble for expectations about upcoming conditions in the short term. That dropped to its lowest level in 12 years and is sitting \u201cwell below the threshold of 80 that usually signals a recession ahead.\u201d",
      "Like other recent surveys, the data showed U.S. households are much more concerned about where the economy is heading than where it is currently. So far, actual economic activity and the job market seem to be holding up despite the worsening moods of U.S. companies and consumers.",
      "On Wall Street, Trump Media & Technology Group  climbed 8.9% after the company behind the president\u2019s Truth Social platform said it had reached an agreement with Crypto.com to offer a suite of \u201cAmerica-First\u201d investment funds.",

      "Tesla rose 3.4% after drifting between modest gains and losses following more grim sales figures from Europe. Its stock nevertheless remains down nearly 29% for 2025 so far.",
      "In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 60 cents to $69.60 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 63 cents at $73.02 per barrel.",

      "Democrats say they are willing to work with Republicans on a debt ceiling increase, but not as a pretext to deliver tax cuts that they say will most help the wealthiest Americans at the expense of those who rely on important safety net programs.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are ready to work across the aisle to prevent a catastrophic default. But Republicans must work with us to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,\u201d said Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.",

      "North Carolina government cashed in early when it came to reaping fiscal benefits from authorized sports wagering in the ninth-largest state",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina government cashed in early when it came to reaping fiscal benefits from authorized sports wagering in the ninth-largest state.",
      "A report presented Wednesday to the North Carolina State Lottery Commission, which regulates the betting, says the state expects to have collected $131.3 million in taxes from sports betting operations for the first full year of operations through March 10.",
      "That amount goes well beyond estimates of state legislative researchers as the bill worked its way through the General Assembly that enacted it in 2023. They had projected tax revenues could reach $100 million annually within five years. The calculation is based on the law's 18% rate upon gross wagering revenue, which is essentially betting revenue minus paid winnings.",
      "On March 11, 2024, licensed operators began taking bets on smartphones and computers under the 2023 state law permitting and regulating such gambling. At the time, North Carolina became the 30th state to offer mobile sports better, along with the District of Columbia.",
      "The windfall is connected to big betting. For the first full year of North Carolina operations, over $6.8 billion in bets were made, resulting in $729.3 million in gross wagering revenue for the eight licensees, according to the commission report.",
      "\u201cIt was a very successful year in my opinion,\u201d Sterl Carpenter, the lottery's chief business development officer who helped get sports wagering off the ground, told the commission. \u201cThings went extremely well.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that we are very encouraged by the results,\u201d commissioner Cari Boyce said.",
      "With a population of 11 million, North Carolina had been considered an attractive market for interactive wagering companies seeking to open. Before the law was implemented, sports gambling was legal in North Carolina only at three casinos operated by two American Indian tribes.",
      "Under the law, registered customers within the state\u2019s borders can bet on professional, college or Olympic-style sports. The law allows for future in-person wagering through sportsbooks beyond those already located at the tribal casinos.",
      "Close to $500 million in the sports wagering revenues during the past year were considered \u201cpromotional wagers\u201d \u2014 incentives for new customers offered by the companies once an initial bet is made. With those amounts removed, the complete months with the highest betting totals were November, December and January \u2014 a period that features college and professional football playoffs, as well as college basketball and pro hockey and hoops.",
      "The tax revenues collected partly go to athletic departments at most University of North Carolina system schools, amateur sports initiatives and gambling addiction education and treatment.",

      "PARIS -- Ukraine\u2019s allies from across Europe gathered for talks in Paris on Thursday about how to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand and its military as it pushes for a ceasefire with Russia, and to consider proposals to deploy European troops in the country in tandem with any peace deal.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on.",
      "Before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace, Russian drone attacks overnight wounded more than 20 people and heavy shelling Thursday afternoon killed one person and knocked out electricity in parts of Kherson, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and last week to halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace. But Ukraine and Russia have disagreed over the details and accused each other of deal violations, foreshadowing a long and contentious process ahead.",
      "France and the United Kingdom are pushing a separate initiative to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of a European armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing any peace deal by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again.",
      "Some European countries are more comfortable with a potential deployment than others \u2014 not least because a big unknown is whether Trump would allow American forces and intelligence agencies to back up any European contingent with air and logistical support and other assistance.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said that military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted an image from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",
      "Macron said Wednesday that the proposed European force could deploy to \u201cimportant towns, strategic bases\u201d in Ukraine and that it could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the front lines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the front lines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "The meeting in Paris came as Russia has demanded lifting sanctions to meet its terms for the Black Sea ceasefire.",
      "Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Europe have punished Russia\u2019s economy and limited its access to global markets.",
      "Zelenskyy accused Moscow of attempting to add conditions to what should be an unconditional agreement.",
      "While the White House said that it would help restore Russia\u2019s access to the world market for fertilizer and farm exports, it didn\u2019t validate Moscow\u2019s conditions. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Russia\u2019s demands would be evaluated and presented to Trump.",
      "There has been a growing chorus of opposition in Europe to lifting the sanctions, which remain their main leverage against Moscow.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the president of the European Council representing the EU's 27 member states, said that sanctions are crucial to support Ukraine and reach a lasting peace.",
      "\u201cThis means keeping up the pressure on Russia through sanctions,\u201d Costa said Thursday.",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight wounded at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a front-line community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe shouldn't ease sanctions on Moscow.",

      "Kroger is denying Albertsons\u2019 claims that it didn\u2019t do enough to ensure regulatory approval of the companies\u2019 planned supermarket merger.",
      "In court papers filed Tuesday in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Kroger said Albertsons disregarded the companies\u2019 merger agreement and worked secretly with a partner, C&S Wholesalers, to try to force Kroger to divest more stores to C&S.",
      "Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn\u2019t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Albertsons said it was Kroger that failed to honor the merger agreement.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons\u2019 shareholders to compensate for those losses,\u201d Albertsons said.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.",
      "But the Federal Trade Commission and two states \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers\u2019 wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.",
      "In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.",
      "Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.",
      "But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",

      "Raised in Moscow within the Soviet sports system by parents who were accomplished athletes, Alex Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed at hockey and along the way showed he didn\u2019t need special treatment",
      "Alex Ovechkin almost stopped playing hockey.",
      "His mother, Tatyana, was a basketball player, his father, Mikhail, was a soccer player and they were traveling with their teams, leaving no one to take young Alex to practice. Coach Vyacheslav Kirillov begged Tatyana to get him back in the sport until she gave in.",
      "Good thing, too. When Ovechkin was 12 and playing in a competitive Moscow youth league. he realized he needed three goals to break a record set by Pavel Bure. He scored six times the next game.",
      "A few years later, other parents thought putting Ovechkin on the first line with Dynamo was favoritism because his parents worked for the club, so Tatyana asked the coach to demote him. He made the fourth line the team's best.",
      "Raised in the final years of the Soviet sports system by parents who were already accomplished athletes, Ovechkin was given every chance to succeed and, along the way, showed he didn't need special treatment. He evolved into a superstar on the ice and the top NHL draft pick by the Washington Capitals in 2004.",
      "Over the past 20 years, he became a Stanley Cup champion who celebrated by swimming in fountains \u2014 he has long been known as a fun-loving person \u2014 and teammates watched him develop into a husband, father and a generous person paying for dinners on the road and growing reflective on his career and accomplishments. Next on that list will be breaking Wayne Gretzky's career goals record.",
      "\u201cHe was a very, very bright young man in terms of his goal-setting for his life,\" said Hockey Hall of Famer Igor Larionov, who met Ovechkin as a teenager. \"He was determined. He was one of the fastest players on the ice, and he had a purpose. Every time he stepped on the ice, he was going to be the best.\"",
      "Born Sept. 17, 1985, and coming of age just as the Soviet Union was giving way to a new Russia, Ovechkin was drawn to the game through his father. If Mikhail's gifts had a bigger impact, his son might have been more like goaltender Vladislav Tretiak than a power forward and pure scorer.",
      "\"He would go on some trips and bring me some goalie helmets,\" Ovechkin once recalled. \"I didn\u2019t know what it was, except it was something about hockey, and when I was a little kid everything was about hockey, hockey, hockey.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin embraced hockey and showed he was good at it. When marketing executive Steven Warshaw went to Moscow in the 1990s to work for the Pittsburgh Penguins after they invested in a team there, he heard all about the next generation of Russian stars.",
      "\u201cThey give them everything they can -- the best coaching, the best everything,\u201d Warshaw said. \u201cHe was definitely given a jump start as all great athletes are, especially when you have the lineage.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was 14 when Larionov, by that time already a three-time Cup champion, sat with him in the locker room and shared some advice about doing extra summer training and committing to training in the gym.",
      "\u201cHe knew at home from the parents, from mom and dad, to be successful you have to be determined to do extra things off ice, on ice and follow the right steps,\u201d Larionov said. \"It\u2019s synergy between genetics from his parents, his approach to the game, his drive, his fire, his power that made him a great player.\u201d",
      "At 17, Ovechkin scored a tournament-best six goals in seven games to help Russia repeat as world junior champions and was again the leading scorer the following year as he emerged as the top prospect in the NHL draft, just ahead of countryman Evgeni Malkin.",
      "The lockout that wiped out the 2004-05 season delayed Ovechkin's North American arrival, but on his first shift Ovechkin hit an opponent so hard he dislodged the partition holding the plexiglass together. He also scored career goal No. 1, then goal No. 2 on the way to getting 52 of them and becoming rookie of the year.",
      "\u201cHe was actually making giant, massive steps toward stardom and started scoring goals, got his confidence,\u201d Larionov said. \"The Washington Capitals got the right players around him to kind of fit him and use his biggest strength, power, speed and shot.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin led the NHL in goals and points in 2008-09, helping the Capitals make the playoffs in his third season and first of three as NHL MVP.",
      "Ovechkin still visits Russia, usually annually, and he has been criticized for his relationship with Vladimir Putin after expressing support for the Russian president in November 2017 ahead of an election. At the time, he told The AP and Washington Post, \u201cI just support my country\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about political stuff.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin was surrounded by young talent in his early years in Washington. Center Nicklas Backstrom, defenseman Mike Green and winger Alexander Semin joined and made hockey in the nation's capital must-see entertainment. They were also having plenty of fun off the ice.",
      "\u201cHe should\u2019ve been out having his fun and having a new car every other week,\u201d retired teammate Mike Knuble said. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of like, \u2018Oh, what car\u2019s he driving this week?\u2019 And just having a good, old time doing whatever he wanted to do and just playing hockey and bagging individual awards.\u201d",
      "In a sport that defines players for winning championships, Knuble worried that Ovechkin would be known only for the individual accomplishments because the playoff success wasn't coming. The Capitals went through a series of changes from the front office to the coaching staff and the roster, culminating with Ovechkin leading them to the Stanley Cup in 2018 as playoff MVP.",
      "\u201cHe just didn't want to let it go,\u201d Backstrom said of the Cup.",
      "Even though Ovechkin was 32, he and the Capitals celebrated like few teams in recent history. They famously swam in the Georgetown fountains \u2014 a plaque now marks the spot \u2014 and the entire run showed the best of Ovechkin.",
      "\u201cA big heart like a big kid,\u201d longtime teammate John Carlson said. \u201cHe loves coming to the rink and he loves scoring goals and playing like we did when we were kids.\u201d",
      "Ovechkin changed off the ice, too. He and Nastya Shubskaya married in 2016, and the couple had even more reason to celebrate the summer of 2018 when she gave birth their first son, Sergei, that August. Ilya, was born in the spring of 2020, and the boys have been right there with their dad for many of his big moments since.",
      "When Ovechkin scored his 801st and 802nd goals just before Christmas 2022, to pass Gordie Howe for second on the all-time list, he walked into the locker room hand-in-hand with Sergei and Ilya and put them on his lap to take photos.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, you have to think about your family, kids first, Nast, me,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cIt changed 100%.\u201d",
      "At 2023 All-Star Weekend in South Florida, possibly Ovechkin's last appearance at one of those, Sergei joined him on the ice in a matching \u201cOvi Jr.\u201d jersey with, of course, his dad's signature No. 8.",
      "\u201cHe will remember that for all his life,\u201d Ovechkin said.",
      "Knuble has enjoyed seeing Ovi the dad take this in maybe even more than the goal-scorer. Tom Wilson, a teammate since 2013, now a father and likely to succeed Ovechkin as captain, has witnessed the growth firsthand \u2014 joining them for family vacations and seeing him as a family man, playing \u201cDance Dance Revolution\u201d with his nephews and nieces.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a dull moment,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Even at home, where Ovechkin enjoys spending time with his wife, kids and their 9-year-old black lab, Blake.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t think about hockey,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t think about the training or practice. You just enjoy your life, enjoy your time with the kids, with family, with friends and you can basically do whatever you want.\u201d",
      "Backstrom met Ovechkin nearly two decades ago before either was 21. The fun times, the Cup win and hundreds of goals between them have come and gone.",
      "\"He\u2019s always been the same,\" Backstrom said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed a lot since the first time I met him: the same kind of outgoing person.\u201d",
      "Former teammate Nate Schmidt called Ovechkin \u201cunapologetically himself.\u201d Marcus Johansson, who played his first seven NHL seasons with Washington and had another stint with the Capitals, said Ovechkin is inviting, has \u201cgot a big heart and he takes care of the people around him.\u201d",
      "That's what current center Dylan Strome tells friends and folks back home when they ask what Ovechkin is like.",
      "\u201cVery, very, very generous with his time, his money \u2014 going out of his way for people,\u201d Strome said. \u201cHe always wants to be with the guys, whether it\u2019s watch sports or just talk or whatever or have a couple beers, he\u2019s always in for that.\u201d",
      "Carlson believes the 39-year-old Ovechkin has stayed young as the age gap between veterans and young teammates in the locker room grows, while at the same time appreciating each moment a little more. Wilson has seen Ovechkin sign dozens of pucks, sticks and jerseys for other teams after a game without the slightest hesitation.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t even really describe him in words,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy that\u2019s bigger than life, bigger than hockey. A personality that whenever he does hang them up, the game will miss him a lot.\u201d",

      "ZURICH -- The winner of FIFA\u2019s first 32-team Club World Cup in the United States could earn $125 million as details of a $1 billion prize money fund were finally published Wednesday.",
      "FIFA said it allocated $525 million in guaranteed fees for teams taking part in the June 14-July 13 tournament, ranging from $38.19 million to the top-ranked European team \u2013 likely Real Madrid \u2013 to $3.58 million for the Oceania representative Auckland City.",
      "A further $475 million is earned by results in the 63 games, with $2 million paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final at MetLife Stadium near New York.",
      "The golden trophy has been sitting in the Oval Office at the White House this month after FIFA President Gianni Infantino delivered it to President Donald Trump.",
      "The prize fund was delayed until a global broadcast deal was belatedly agreed in December with streaming service DAZN, which then got a major investment from a state-backed sports agency in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Saudi Arabia also was confirmed in December by FIFA as host of the men\u2019s 2034 World Cup.",
      "Each of the 12 European teams in the Club World Cup lineup will be paid at least $12.81 million as an entry fee. Payments will be decided by \u201ca ranking based on sporting and commercial criteria,\u201d FIFA said without providing details.",
      "Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea also qualified by either winning a Champions League title from 2021 to 2024, or having consistent results in the competition over those four seasons.",
      "Countries were capped at two entries, unless they had three Champions League winners. Salzburg of Austria qualified as the final European team, despite never advancing beyond the round of 16, because higher-ranked clubs like Liverpool and Barcelona were blocked by the country cap.",
      "The six South American teams each will get a $15.21 million entry fee.",
      "Teams from Africa, Asia and the CONCACAF region of North America \u2014 including Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, despite not winning the MLS Cup title last season \u2014 each will get $9.55 million for playing.",
      "Leon of Mexico is currently contesting its removal from the competition by FIFA because it is in shared ownership with Pachuca which also qualified.",
      "FIFA aims to pay $250 million to clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament. It is unclear how many clubs will be paid, or how much they will get.",

      "The NFL competition committee is recommending making the dynamic kickoff rule permanent and moving touchbacks to the 35-yard line in hopes of generating even more returns.",
      "The competition committee released several potential rule changes for 2025 on Wednesday, including an expansion of instant replay that will be considered next week at the league meetings in Palm Beach, Florida. Any rule change must be approved by 24 out of 32 team owners.",
      "Teams submitted several proposals last week that also could be voted on at the league meetings, including banning the \u201ctush push\u201d and changing playoff seeding rules.",
      "Owners approved a major change to the kickoff last year on a one-year trial basis and the committee recommended another change to increase the rate of returns without increasing the risk of injuries. The league had 332 additional returns last season with the rate increasing from a record-low 21.8% in 2023 to 32.8% last season.",
      "The committee hopes that moving the touchback on kicks that reach the end zone on the fly from the 30 to the 35 will incentivize kicking teams to opt for shorter kicks that lead to more returns.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing teams to declare their intention for an onside kick at any point in the game when they are trailing instead of only in the fourth quarter.",
      "The committee proposed a few other tweaks to how players on the return team can align before the kick but the basics will remain the same with the kicker lining up at his own 35, the 10 coverage players at the 40, and at least nine blockers lined up in the \u201csetup zone\u201d between the 30- and 35-yard line and up to two returners in the landing zone inside the 20.",
      "Any kick that reaches the end zone in the air can be returned, or the receiving team can opt for a touchback, which now will be at the 35.",
      "Only the kicker and two returners are allowed to move until the ball hits the ground or is touched by a returner inside the 20.",
      "According to the NFL, there were 59 returns of at least 40 yards last season, the most in the league since 2016, and seven TD returns. The concussion rate fell 43% from the previous three years and there were the fewest lower-extremity strains on kick return plays since 2018.",
      "The committee also proposed an expansion of instant replay to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was \u201cclear and obvious\u201d evidence that a foul didn't occur. Replay would also be able to overturn a roughing the kicker or running into the kicker penalty if video replay showed the defender made contact with the ball.",
      "The committee also proposed allowing two players to be designated to return from injured reserve if they are placed on IR when rosters are reduced to 53, granting playoff teams two more return from IR spots in the postseason, and using point differential as the third tiebreaker on waiver claims.",

      "AP All-America center Lauren Betts, Ayoka Lee and Sedona Prince are traditional post players, and all have been in the middle of their teams making it to the Sweet 16 in the women's NCAA Tournament.",
      "There just may not be as many players like them in the future with more teams opting for flexible posts who play on the perimeter and shoot 3-pointers. Plus, that is how players are now often being taught at younger ages.",
      "\u201cAll these young ladies are getting more skilled. They\u2019re able to step away from the basket. They are able to face up and play,\u201d Kansas State coach Jeff Mittie said. \u201cI think, as you\u2019re seeing youth basketball progress, that they\u2019re getting more training earlier, where not just to stand in the paint and play. ... The game has evolved.\"",
      "Even so, these women are excelling inside during this March Madness.",
      "The 6-foot-7 Betts had 30 points and 14 rebounds for top-seeded UCLA in a second-round win over Richmond. The junior has made 63.6% of her 825 career field goal attempts over three years, and has a Bruins single-season record 90 blocked shots.",
      "Prince, also 6-7, combined for 35 points and 14 rebounds to help TCU advance past the second round for the first time.",
      "The 6-6 Lee has 33 points and 19 rebounds while playing only 43 minutes combined in K-State\u2019s two tourney games, after missing 12 of the previous 13 games with a foot injury.",
      "Betts, with career averages of 13.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, said it takes more than just having the requisite size to be consistent and successful in the low post.",
      "\u201cPatience has always been my biggest thing,\" said Betts, in her second season at UCLA after one at Stanford. \u201cWhen I\u2019m catching it inside, obviously there (are) a few people running at me at a time, so just making sure I\u2019m not rushing myself.\"",
      "While UCLA coach Cori Close agrees that the game is evolving, the Bruins \u2014 who next play fifth-seeded Ole Miss on Friday night \u2014 certainly take full advantage of having their dominant center.",
      "\u201cSo it just has this domino effect, but it starts with her,\u201d Close said. \u201cThe reality for us is that if she gets a touch \u2014 people work possessions all the time just to create rotation. Like how are we going to do this, create rotation, flatten out their defense, force them to be in a scramble mode. We have a really good way. We just pass it to Lauren and force that every single time.\u201d",
      "Lee was a second-team AP All-American as a junior in 2022, the same year she set an NCAA single-game record with 61 points against Oklahoma, but missed all of the following season because of a knee injury. Her 64.1% field goal percentage this season is a career high, while averaging 15.6 points and 6.4 rebounds playing fewer than 19 minutes a game.",
      "\u201cI definitely have been a more traditional post, and that\u2019s just where my strength lies,\" Lee said. \u201cOur coaches and our team have done a good job of building a strong guard presence around that. So I haven\u2019t really had to really step out much.\u201d",
      "The fifth-seeded Wildcats play top-seeded USC on Saturday night. Earlier that day, second-seeded TCU faces third-seeded Notre Dame for the second time this season.",
      "Prince is among 11 transfers for TCU since coach Mark Campbell took over two years ago after the Horned Frogs went 1-17 in Big 12 games.",
      "Campbell was previously an Oregon assistant and overlapped some of Prince's time there. Nyara Sabally was then the prominent player inside for the Ducks, but the coach wanted Prince to dominate inside for the Horned Frogs.",
      "\u201cMe and Sedona have had healthy dialog of trying to figure out how to impose her will in games,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf I let her, she would stay on the perimeter and shoot 3s all game. ... I think the greatest thing she\u2019s improved in is getting comfortable around the basket and imposing her will around the basket.\"",
      "Prince made the only 3 she has attempted since Christmas, and is 8 for 28 from long range in her career. Neither Betts nor Lee have shot any 3s.",
      "\u201cI was a passer and a shooter (at Oregon), and that\u2019s why I got really good at that like 12- to 15-foot range shot,\" Prince said. \"So coming here, Mark and I had the conversation of like, you need to get really, really good at catching the ball deep in the post and making simple post moves, but take advantage of being 6-7, getting stronger. Yeah, it's fun.\u201d",

      "ST. LOUIS -- The wins just keep on coming for the St. Louis Blues, and their seven-game streak has significantly improved their chances of returning to the playoffs after a two-year absence.",
      "After beating the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on Tuesday night, they have strung together their most consecutive victories since November 2022. It's the longest active winning streak in the NHL.",
      "\u201cWe've just got a recipe that works and a game plan that everybody believes in,\u201d said Dylan Holloway, who has 24 goals in a breakout season. \u201cGuys are playing for each other. It's a good vibe in here, for sure.\u201d",
      "St. Louis has outscored opponents 36-10 and only trailed for a total of 5:24 during this winning stretch. It's just business as usual, according to Alexandre Texier.",
      "\u201cWe've got a job to do,\u201d said Texier, who like Holloway, scored against Montreal. \u201cThis game is over and we think about the next game. We're not enjoying too much about this momentum. We want to be in the playoffs. We just have to do it every single night.\u201d",
      "The Blues are 13-2-2 since the season resumed after the 4 Nations Face-Off break, outscoring opponents 70-38. No team in the NHL has more points or goals in that time.",
      "\u201cThere's a pace and a purpose to what they're doing,\u201d coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cThey're just doing it naturally. There's smiles on their faces. They're loving doing things right.\"",
      "The formula during the streak has been simple. The Blues are strong on the forecheck and work to limit transition opportunities for their opponents. They block as many shots as possible.",
      "\u201cIt starts with the belief in this group and believing in the process and each other,\u201d said Philip Broberg, who scored a goal and had three assists against Montreal to keep his impressive season rolling. \u201cIt's all about hard work.\u201d",
      "Montgomery agreed, calling his team's effort professional.",
      "\u201cEveryone's playing well: Our top line, our top six are scoring and playing defense,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cOur bottom six are scoring and hanging on to pucks and protecting pucks. Our defense has been really solid. The little details have been there throughout the lineup. Everybody\u2019s doing it.\"",
      "Montgomery has helped turn things around since replacing fired coach Drew Bannister on Nov. 25 after a 9-12-1 start. But the Blues were still eight points behind Vancouver for the Western Conference's second and final wild-card spot coming out of the break and had not won three in a row all season.",
      "It looked like the playoff drought would reach three. Now it looks like that could end.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s a simple answer, but it\u2019s just guys playing hard, playing for one another and playing together,\u201d captain Brayden Schenn said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t all been pretty, but we\u2019re finding a way and that\u2019s the most important thing this time of the year. There\u2019s definitely buzz around the city. \u201d",
      "The Blues hold a firm grip on the second wild card in the Western Conference, four up on Calgary and five up on Vancouver. They now have the Wild \u2014 holders of the first wild card \u2014 in their sights, just two points back after Minnesota lost 5-1 to Vegas.",
      "All those teams have games in hand on the the Blues, who have nine left, compared to 12 for the Flames and 11 for the Canucks. Holloway doesn't think anyone is looking at how many games anyone has left.",
      "\u201cObviously, we know it's a tight race,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cThe biggest thing is we just have to control what we can control. We can't control other teams. The biggest thing for us is to just keep playing the way we are. It works. We just have to go a game at a time.\u201d",
      "The Blues hit the road to play Thursday in Nashville looking to extend their win streak to eight games.",

      "Red Bull has dropped Liam Lawson as the teammate of Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen just two rounds into the season and replaced him with Yuki Tsunoda",
      "Red Bull dropped Liam Lawson as the teammate of Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen after just two rounds of the season and replaced him with Yuki Tsunoda on Thursday.",
      "Lawson was given the Red Bull seat despite not having previously driven a full F1 season and struggled immediately. The New Zealander did not score any points, crashed out of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and qualified in last place for the Chinese Grand Prix and its sprint race.",
      "Tsunoda moves up from Red Bull\u2019s second team, Racing Bulls, in time for his home Japanese GP next week. Lawson will take Tsunoda\u2019s place at Racing Bulls alongside rookie Isack Hadjar.",
      "The change is a sign of how cut-throat F1 can be and an admission that Red Bull made the wrong choice in picking Lawson. He completed only 11 career F1 races before this season and was typically slower than Tsunoda across their six races as teammates last year.",
      "\u201cIt has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the (car) at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,\u201d Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe came into the 2025 season with two ambitions, to retain the world drivers\u2019 championship and to reclaim the world constructors\u2019 title and this is a purely sporting decision.\u201d",
      "Horner acknowledged there was work to be done with the team\u2019s RB21 car and said Tsunoda\u2019s experience will prove beneficial in helping to develop it.",
      "\u201cWe have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and, together, we see that after such a difficult start it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Replacing Lawson so quickly is in stark contrast to the patience shown Verstappen\u2019s former teammate Sergio Perez, who was handed a two-year contract extension midway through a disappointing 2024 season. The team eventually dropped Perez for Lawson in December after four years.",
      "Lawson spoke publicly about his difficulties with the RB21 car, saying on Sunday it was \u201ctricky\u201d to drive and had a \u201cvery small window\u201d for the setup to be competitive. That echoed comments from Perez last year that the car became increasingly difficult to handle as Red Bull\u2019s development work leaned toward Verstappen\u2019s driving style.",
      "The 24-year-old Tsunoda has been in F1 since 2021 with a career-best championship placing of 12th last year and has yet to finish on the podium. He\u2019s previously faced criticism within the broader Red Bull operation for a tendency to vent his frustrations over the radio during races.",
      "Tsunoda\u2019s long-term future is complicated by his personal backing from Honda, which is being replaced as Red Bull\u2019s engine supplier at the end of the year ahead of a new deal with Ford from 2026. Honda will supply Aston Martin next season.",
      "Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies said he was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of Tsunoda for making the move to Red Bull. \u201cHis progress last year, and more recently from the very start of 2025, has been nothing less than sensational,\u201d he said.",
      "Tsunoda becomes Verstappen\u2019s sixth teammate in 10 seasons with Red Bull. It\u2019s the first time that the main Red Bull team has changed drivers midseason since 2019 when Pierre Gasly was dropped for Alex Albon after 12 races.",
      "Verstappen is the only Red Bull driver to win a race in almost two years and the only one on the podium in nearly a year. He\u2019s scored all of the team\u2019s points in the four races since Perez placed 10th in Las Vegas in November.",

      "Several new bars dedicated to women\u2019s sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing",
      "PHOENIX -- When you walk into Title 9 Sports Grill in Phoenix's Melrose District, its mission to be a haven for watching women's sports permeates every nook and cranny. From the over dozen TVs mounted on pink and orange walls to the \u201cPlay Like a Girl!\u201d neon sign against a giant image of retired WNBA star Diana Taurasi.",
      "It's an impressive turnaround for co-owners Audrey Corley and Kat Moore. Just before Christmas, the space was still Moore and her husband Brad's hot dog restaurant. But last summer they sold the business and the new owners didn't want to stay in the property. That's when Corley, who owns a popular lesbian bar on the next block, proposed partnering on the city's first women's sports-centric bar. She had been mulling the idea since reading about the Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, which opened in 2022, and then seeing a half-dozen similar bars emerge in the last year.",
      "\u201cThen I see, you know, another one popped up here and another one. And then I was like, it\u2019s just time. It has to be,\u201d Corley said before Title 9's grand opening earlier this month.",
      "Several new bars dedicated to women's sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing. From San Francisco to Cleveland, there will be more than a dozen across the country before the year is over. The femme-focused bar scene has made huge strides from three years ago when The Sports Bra was the only one. It comes during an exciting first year during which teams in the women's bracket will finally be paid for playing in the NCAA tourney. Many credit stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese for increasing the marketability of female players.",
      "Last season, Reese and Clark's teams never saw a dollar. Now, the women's teams will finally earn individual revenue, known as \u201cunits.\u201d A unit is money paid to conferences when one of its teams appears in the NCAA Tournament. Teams earn another with every game played.",
      "The most seamless part of transforming her old restaurant into Title 9 has been the built-in community anticipation of having a place to view women's sports, Moore said.",
      "\"The only question I\u2019ve gotten from quite a few men, especially when we first started telling people, was, \u2018Are men allowed?\u2019 Yeah!\u201d Moore said, with a chuckle.",
      "Named for the landmark 1972 law that forbids discrimination based on sex in education, including athletics, Title 9 is filled with tributes to female athletes, from framed photos with QR codes to a cocktail roster with drinks such as the Pat Summitt Sour and Taurasi Goat-Tail. However, the owners emphasize a family-friendly atmosphere where young girls can come celebrate after a school game.",
      "\u201cEven some of the little girls, they could come here and dream of being on the TV someday and actually getting paid for it,\u201d Corley said.",
      "Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis were also inspired by the Sports Bra. They made their targeted opening in Austin last week of 1972 ATX Women's Sports Pub across from the University of Texas campus. The day included a rainbow ribbon cutting and officials from the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.",
      "While they are in a conservative state, the women have been emphasizing the bar\u2019s LGBTQ-friendliness.",

      "SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Mikaela Shiffrin's flashbacks to her November crash in a giant slalom race are happening less and less when she's training.",
      "For her, as she deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the discipline, that's major progress.",
      "While other racers compete in the GS on Tuesday at World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Shiffrin plans to squeeze in some training in the slalom. It will be the American standout's only event of the weeklong finals after not qualifying in giant slalom.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion revealed last month that she\u2019s suffering from PTSD after falling in the GS on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont. In the crash, something punctured Shiffrin's side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin skipped the giant slalom at world championships and has raced the discipline three times since, with her best showing 25th place.",
      "But she's back to turning in fast sections at practice in the GS, a discipline that blends speed and technical skill.",
      "\u201cTraining is going well. It\u2019s actually super positive. Training has been improving day-by-day,\u201d Shiffrin said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday before signing autographs for fans. \u201cI'm just trying to get back to the confidence that I was skiing with in Killington when the crash happened. That would be a big goal.\u201d",
      "On that day, Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS as she charged after her 100th World Cup win. The finish line was in sight on her final run, when she lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis.",
      "The all-time winningest Alpine World Cup ski racer then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. She still doesn't know what led to the puncture wound.",
      "To help with getting back in the giant slalom start gate, she's been working with a psychologist. Leading into world championships and the GS, she checked most of the boxes for PTSD symptoms. A few weeks later in Are, Sweden, she checked fewer.",
      "\u201cMy processing speed and the mind-body connection has come back in a great way,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who earned her 100th World Cup win last month in Italy. \"But every now and then I\u2019ll still have the sort of intrusive images or thoughts cross my mind of crashing or the pain. Normally, it\u2019s in the start gate. If I\u2019m starting to get a little bit tired in a session, I just imagine everything that could go wrong and it\u2019s kind of an intense reaction.",
      "\u201cBut it happens so much less often now. It does feel very true that simply exposure to doing the thing that\u2019s pretty uncomfortable is helpful.\u201d",
      "Following her slalom training session Tuesday, Shiffrin will be watching as New Zealand\u2019s Alice Robinson tries to hold off Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone for the crystal globe in the giant slalom.",
      "The 30-year-old Shiffrin can see glimpses of her GS form returning. She won an Olympic gold medal in the discipline at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and 22 of her 100 World Cup victories have come in giant slalom.",
      "\u201cSome of my turns are competitive with the fastest in the world,\u201d said Shiffrin, whose slalom race is Thursday. \u201cBut putting that together for a minute and 10-second GS run \u2014 that just takes time and repetition. We\u2019ll need to try to get some days this summer with long course sets, with a lot of variation of course sets, variation of conditions. I don\u2019t doubt that I can get to that competitive level again.",
      "\"I think a lot of my skiing is already there.\u201d",

      "Velasquez was sentenced in Santa Clara County after he pled no contest to attempted murder, felony assault, and other related gun charges last August for what the district attorney's office called a \u201cvigilante shooting spree.\u201d He will receive credit for time served.",
      "In February 2022, the two-time UFC heavyweight champion fired a gun multiple times at a truck carrying three people, including 46-year-old Harry Goularte, who is facing felony child molestation charges, according to the district attorney's office.",
      "His defense attorney, Renee Hessling, called the result \u201cbittersweet\u201d as they had hoped to keep Velasquez out of prison.",
      "\u201cThroughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,\" Hessling said in a statement. \u201cHe has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.\u201d",
      "Less than a week prior to the shooting, Goularte was arrested in connection to the sexual assault of a 4-year-old at the daycare owned by his family. He was released without bail a few days later. Officials said he was released under house arrest and was on his way to retrieve an electronic monitoring bracelet when Velasquez attacked.",
      "Velasquez shot at Goularte's truck in a car chase that lasted for 11 miles (17.7 kilometers), the district attorney\u2019s office said. Goularte was uninjured, but his stepfather, who was driving, was hit twice.",

      "\u201cWe cannot put the law in our own hands,\" Velasquez said. \"I know what I did, and I know what I did was very dangerous to other people, you know? Not just to people involved, but innocent people. I understand what I did and I\u2019m willing to do everything I have to, to pay that back.\u201d",
      "Velasquez also said it was important to have open and honest with your kids about what kind of behavior is acceptable and listen to what they say.",

      "Tests are underway at Cortina\u2019s controversial Olympic sliding track",
      "ROME -- When Italian skeleton competitor Mattia Gaspari became the first athlete to test the controversial sliding track for next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, he did so in a sort of tunnel under a temporary roof built of wooden beams and white plastic paper.",
      "That's because the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo is still under construction and the only part that is really finished is the track structure.",
      "Still, getting to this point little more than a year after construction began is a big achievement for the Italian government, which rebuilt the century-old track despite calls from the International Olympic Committee to hold bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes at a venue in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite an adventure,\u201d Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the construction firm, which was the first one to believe in this, and the journalists who motivated us,\u201d said Salvini, who is also the deputy premier, citing articles claiming that the project would never be done. \u201cWell, here we are.\u201d",
      "Olympic bronze medalist Dominik Fischnaller was the second athlete down the track on his luge before Simone Bertazzo and Eric Fantazzini made a two-man bobsled run.",
      "Simico, the government agency in charge of the 118 million euro ($128 million) project, reported positive results for the test runs. But it will be officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation and the IOC to determine whether to bestow preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track.",
      "Preliminary approval would be a big step in avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time. Lake Placid officials were hopeful that, if the sliding events were going to be awarded to the U.S., the official word would come by the end of March.",
      "Construction on the Cortina track began in February last year. The pre-homologation plan calls for athletes to begin their initial runs from the junior start, well below the ramps from where they would begin to race for World Cup and Olympic competitions. Sliders would move up the track slowly throughout the coming days.",
      "There are testing events at the Cortina track for all three sliding sports \u2014 bobsled, skeleton and luge \u2014 scheduled for throughout the fall. Those are important so that sliders can familiarize themselves with the track and feel safe there when competing at the Olympics. Safety has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Luge athletes are scheduled to have an international training period at the new track from Oct. 27 through Nov. 2, then return for a test event there in the final week of November. The bobsled and skeleton tours will hold their international training period from Nov. 7-16, followed by the season-opening World Cup races there from Nov. 17-23.",
      "The 1.749-kilometer (1.09-mile) track features 16 curves with an estimated top speed of 145 kph (90 mph) with run times slated for 55-60 seconds.",
      "Athletes from 12 nations are involved in the tests this week. It's about 60 athletes in all, about half of them being Italian sliders. Coaches representing at least 23 different sliding nations were also invited to view this week's events.",

      "Now he can't miss.",
      "The junior guard has been on an absolute tear with his outside shot, hitting at least six 3-pointers for the past three games going back to the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament final. It's been a boost to an offense already humming at elite efficiency as the top-seeded Blue Devils head into Thursday's matchup with Arizona in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament's East Region in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI think the main thing is the mentality of it,\" Proctor said after Sunday's second-round win against Baylor. \"I'm just shooting knowing the ball is going to go in and not hoping it's going in as the big thing.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 guard from Australia has made 19 of 28 3-pointers (67.9%) since missing his first two attempts in the ACC title-game win against Louisville. And he's only gotten hotter with each passing possession.",

      "Only he topped that two days later, making 7 of 8 against the Bears.",
      "That's 13 for 16 through two March Madness games, a shocking 81.3% hit rate. The 13 made 3s are the most of any player in the Sweet 16, with Houston's LJ Cryer and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier each hitting 10 as the only other players to reach double figures so far.",
      "And Proctor is striking from a variety of ways: on the catch in transition, curling around a screen, using a stepback, even pump-faking a defender off his feet and then resetting off a single dribble to his right \u2014 a move he pulled three times to send a Baylor player flying by on Sunday.",
      "As he kept burying the Bears, he flashed triumphant gestures and unleashed I'm-feeling-it screams toward a home-state crowd as he retreated back to the defensive end.",
      "\u201cSuch a talented player, such a weapon for us when he\u2019s being confident looking for his shot,\u201d freshman star Cooper Flagg said.",
      "The Blue Devils (33-3) have long counted on Proctor as a starter with perimeter length, giving him the ability to create matchup problems at both ends for smaller guards. He has long been a complementary scorer behind Flagg and another freshman in Kon Knueppel, and was averaging 11.8 points entering the Louisville game.",
      "But his kicked-up offense behind that 3-point shot through the last three games has increased his scoring average by approaching a full point (12.5).",
      "It was hard to see this coming as recently as 10 days ago.",
      "After a strong start to February, Proctor's outside shot suddenly abandoned him. Over the next seven games, he would miss 23 of 29 3-pointers, including a pair of 0-for-5 days to start the ACC Tournament. By the time he missed his first two against Louisville in the final, Proctor had missed 14 straight 3s going back to missing his last two in the regular-season finale at rival North Carolina.",
      "Proctor spent time looking at film of his shot with assistant Will Avery after the first two games of the ACCs, trying to decipher where things were misfiring.",
      "\u201cIt's just little things \u2014 just my balance and stuff like that,\" Proctor said. \"At the end of the day, it's just confidence. As soon as my feet get set and I hold my follow-through, I'm just going to keep trusting it.",
      "\"All the 0-for, whatever it was, all that felt good. A couple of them I knew what I did wrong. I think it's just realizing and understanding that, and just fixing it on the fly is a big thing.\u201d",
      "It's a challenge any shooter can understand: finding a delicate balance of tweaking any deficiencies showing up in the form, yet not meddling too much with what has worked for so long.",
      "So far it's working.",
      "\u201cIt's hard, earlier this season I struggled with that,\" Knueppel said. \u201cYou've just got to keep shooting it, that's the only way you can make more shots, is you keep shooting them. So he's done a great job of just being confident. He's really attacking his catches and getting locked and loaded, and ready to go.\u201d",

      "Lamont Butler doesn\u2019t want to settle for just one shining moment on a Final Four stage.",
      "The guy who made the buzzer beater to send San Diego State to the 2023 NCAA Tournament championship game is confident he can get back there as a fifth-year senior with Kentucky.",
      "He has his new teammates believing that as well heading into No. 3 seed Kentucky\u2019s Midwest Region semifinal matchup with No. 2 seed Tennessee (29-7) on Friday in Indianapolis.",
      "\u201cI will say from day one our focus was winning a national championship,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThe expectation here at Kentucky is to win. And we\u2019ve got a bunch of winners here, and we want to continue that tradition.\u201d",
      "This Kentucky team is a little different from any other in its storied history, which is why Butler\u2019s tournament experience with San Diego State has been so essentially.",
      "Kentucky (24-11) didn\u2019t return a single player who scored a point for the Wildcats last season. New coach Mark Pope essentially built a roster from scratch. Nine transfers had to get accustomed to playing together.",
      "Butler emerged as the leader of the group. Kentucky teammate Andrew Carr referenced it before the tournament when he jokingly referred to Butler as \u201cLaMarch.\u201d",
      "The Wildcats look up to him in part because they know what he\u2019s accomplished. The 6-foot-2 guard is making his fifth straight tournament appearance. His jumper as time expired in a 2023 NCAA semifinal gave San Diego State a 72-71 victory over Florida Atlantic, sending the Aztecs into a championship game they lost to UConn.",
      "\u201cMost of us talk about what happened to us,\u201d Pope said. \u201cWe talk about what happened to us. And champions, winners talk about what they made happen. It\u2019s just the truth. It\u2019s true.",
      "\u201cLamont Butler is spending his whole lifetime talking about what he makes happen, and that\u2019s a champion\u2019s heart. And he doesn\u2019t spend any time talking about what happened to him. He talks about all the stuff he makes happen. When you have a guy like that leading your crew like that, it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",
      "Pope related a story from last summer when he was on the road recruiting and the team had planned something for a player who was going through a difficult family situation: \u201cI called in to check with that player and see how the day went, and he had scrapped all the plans because Lamont scooped him up and they spent the day together. And Lamont did that because that\u2019s who he is. He cares.\u201d",
      "Butler said he knew even around that time that this Kentucky team was capable of putting together a run similar to the one his San Diego State team made two years ago - and perhaps doing even more.",
      "\u201cI kind of expected us to be in a good position from the summer to go win a national championship,\u201d Butler said prior to the NCAA Tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s on our mind. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d",
      "Butler is averaging 11.1 points and 4.3 assists \u2013 career highs in both categories \u2013 despite dealing with a left shoulder injury dating to mid-January that cost him six games. He hurt it again in the Southeastern Conference Tournament and didn\u2019t play in a quarterfinal loss to Alabama.",
      "Butler returned for a 76-57 first-round NCAA victory over Troy and didn\u2019t score at all, but he still contributed in so many other ways that he had a plus-minus rating of plus-22. Butler, who has been wearing a brace on the shoulder, had 14 points and five assists in an 84-75 second-round triumph over Illinois.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really a dog,\u201d Kentucky guard Otega Oweh said. \u201cGoing out there with one arm and giving it his all. He\u2019s playing defense, and on top of that, he\u2019s getting us into our offense. When you have someone that\u2019s doing that, it just trickles down. You just want to out there and fight for him, too.\u201d",
      "Butler had three of Kentucky\u2019s 14 steals against Illinois. After the game, Kentucky guard Koby Brea had a simple explanation for why the Wildcats were able to force Illinois into so many turnovers.",
      "\u201cWe have Lamont Butler as the head of defense,\u201d Brea said. \u201cSo I feel like for any team, when you see him pick you up, it has to put something in your stomach, some nerves or something.\u201d",
      "Butler scares his opponents while calming his teammates. He\u2019s providing the presence this team full of transfers needed as they try to get Kentucky back to the Final Four for the first time in a decade.",
      "\u201cI think everybody is hungry this year,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI feel like a lot of us came from smaller schools or different places and we were able to compete at one of the best schools ever. We all wanted to be remembered here.\u201d",
      "Butler already was going to be remembered for that shot he hit two years ago. Now he\u2019s creating a whole new set of memories while wearing a different uniform.",

      "Bold decisions to change Major League Baseball\u2019s longstanding rules quickened the pace of games and revived the popularity of stealing bases over the last few years",
      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Bold decisions to change Major League Baseball\u2019s longstanding rules quickened the pace of games and revived the popularity of stealing bases over the last few years.",
      "A similarly creative move may be needed to help starting pitching regain the relevance it enjoyed as recently as a decade ago.",
      "Only four pitchers (Seattle\u2019s Logan Gilbert, Kansas City\u2019s Seth Lugo, San Francisco\u2019s Logan Webb and Philadelphia\u2019s Zack Wheeler) threw as many as 200 innings last season, down from 34 in 2014.",
      "During that same 2014 season, all 30 major league teams got over 900 innings from their starting pitchers and five had over 1,000. Last year, only four teams had their starters pitch at least 900 innings, led by Seattle with 942 2/3.",
      "While this shift has been years in the making, the numbers themselves provide a cold slap of reality to longtime fans who remember seeing Bob Gibson throw three complete games in the 1967 World Series or Jack Morris pitching 10 shutout innings in Game 7 of the 1991 Fall Classic.",
      "Going back to the days of Cy Young and Walter Johnson, part of the game's beauty was watching a pitcher work his way through a lineup three or four times.",
      "With every team having multiple relievers who can come out of the bullpen and throw in the high 90s, what could prompt teams to let their starters work deeper into games?",
      "Managers and players struggle to come up with a solution.",
      "\u201cOutside of just changing rules to incentivize managers to keep guys in games longer,\u201d Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.",
      "Roberts\u2019 Dodgers exemplified the bullpen emphasis during their run to the 2024 World Series title. Their starting pitchers worked as many as six innings in just two of their 16 postseason games.",
      "Texas\u2019 Nathan Eovaldi went 5-0 with five postseason quality starts (defined as going at least six innings while allowing no more than three earned runs) a year earlier while helping the Rangers win their first World Series championship. Yet even he understands how much things have changed for starting pitchers since he made his big-league debut in 2011.",
      "\u201cBullpens are a lot different now than they were back then,\u201d Eovaldi said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more guys who aren\u2019t just eight- and ninth-inning guys. They can come in, in the sixth or seventh, go multiple innings. They all have multiple pitches now as well. I think that\u2019s one of the fascinating things about the bullpen. You don\u2019t have guys who are just a two-pitch mix anymore. They\u2019ve got three or four pitches coming out, and two of them are really, really elite.\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s why there seems only one way to get starters working more innings.",
      "\u201cPutting in rules that you have to,\u201d San Francisco Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created our own monster. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred says it\u2019s too early to explore rules changes.",
      "\u201cOur focus right now is training methods, particularly offseason training methods,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be somewhere between education and recommendations. It\u2019s very hard to tell people you can\u2019t do X, Y and Z, right? They\u2019re grown men and there\u2019s no way to monitor it during the offseason.\u201d",
      "One problem is the lack of a clear consensus on what rule changes could work best.",
      "For instance, MLB had the Atlantic League experiment in 2021 and 2023 with a rule change that would force a team to lose its designated hitter if its starting pitcher didn\u2019t finish at least five innings.",
      "Instituting that kind of rule could be a tough sell in the majors, where some of the league\u2019s most bankable stars such as Shohei Ohtani and Bryce Harper have received ample playing time at DH the last few years. Fans paying to see those stars likely wouldn\u2019t be happy to see them get removed as collateral damage from an early pitching change.",
      "MLB hasn\u2019t announced any similar types of rules experimentations in the minors this season.",
      "The maximum number of pitchers allowed on MLB rosters was lowered from 14 to 13 in 2022, though that limit rises to 14 when rosters expand from 26 to 28 on Sept. 1. A more extreme rule change would be to require starters to work at least five or six innings unless they get injured, throw a certain number of pitches or allow a particular number of runs.",
      "Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said he wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the minor leagues try out more rule changes designed at lengthening starting pitchers. He wants those pitching prospects to get accustomed to working deeper into games.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way it used to be with starters,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cNow I think the mentality can be, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve done my job. I\u2019ve thrown four or five innings.\u2019 \u201c",
      "Giants pitcher Robbie Ray says the history of the game shows that starters can adapt to longer outings.",
      "\u201cI think starting pitchers are capable of doing it,\u201d said Ray, who won the 2021 AL Cy Young Award with Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of kind of training our bodies to do that again because what\u2019s been expected of us has changed over the years.\u201d",
      "A 62-page MLB study released in December showed how the focus on rising velocities and maximum effort on each pitch had resulted in more injuries among pitchers. That study also revealed that starts of five or more innings dropped from 84% to 70% in the majors from 2005-24 and from 68.9% to 36.8% in the minors.",
      "\u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to create this engine and this repetitive thought of just pure stuff each and every pitch, yeah, starters are going to fatigue sooner,\u201d Cleveland Guardians pitching coach Carl Willis said. \u201cAnd at the same time, we\u2019re training them that way. We\u2019re training them to do so.",
      "\u201cEverybody still talks about wanting to go out for the sixth, wanting to go out for the seventh and getting deep into games. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re training them to do that, and I don\u2019t know how we are kind of teaching nowadays can allow that to happen.\u201d",
      "A change in approach could allow those starters to get that endurance. Right now, it\u2019s the older guys who seem more used to that workload.",
      "The MLB leader in quality starts last season was the 34-year-old Wheeler, who had 26. Lugo, 35, had 22 quality starts to tie for second place.",
      "Even so, the 2024 season did offer some encouraging signs for the future of starting pitching.",
      "MLB pitchers threw 5.22 innings per start last season. That represented the most since 2018, though it was still far off the 2014 average of 5.97.",
      "The 2024 season also featured an MLB average of 85.5 pitches per start, the highest since 2019. Starters haven\u2019t thrown as many as 90 pitches per appearance since 2017.",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s inevitable that the pendulum swing at least a little more toward getting starters to work longer. The recent focus on relievers puts more pressure on them, causing bullpens to break down.",
      "There\u2019s one obvious method to change that.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think necessarily the game is going to all of a sudden turn back the other way, but there\u2019s a huge push to understand how you can keep a bullpen healthy,\u201d Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \u201cAnd one of the biggest ways is those starters getting through that first bulk and getting you into the sixth or seventh.\u201d",
      "Now it\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how those starters can pitch deeper into games more often.",

      "Worthy filed the lawsuit Monday against Tia Jones in Williamson County, Texas, where the two lived and where Worthy played college football at the University of Texas.",
      "Worthy was arrested earlier this month after Jones accused him of assaulting her, but the district attorney declined to file charges in that case after speaking to multiple witnesses.",
      "In his lawsuit, Worthy alleges that Jones fabricated the allegations of abuse and that she became enraged after he asked her to move out of the home they were living in. He says in the lawsuit that Jones assaulted him, ripping out his hair, and destroyed his game room.",
      "He also alleges that while he was in jail, Jones stole a handgun, $30,000 in cash, jewelry, a key to his Rolls Royce and other belongings.",
      "An attorney for Jones, Angelica Cogliano, said Monday she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment.",

      "Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year\u2019s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs\u2019 go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.",
      "Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores.",
      "He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl, too. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.",

      "The Heat will pay tribute to Butler\u2019s 5\u00bd seasons with the team with a pregame video on Tuesday night, one that will be shown in the arena as part of the introduction of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 starting lineup for the game.",
      "Butler said he\u2019ll watch the video, though added that it didn\u2019t matter to him whether the Heat did one or not. He\u2019s insisting that there\u2019s no hard feelings now, a month and a half after he was traded to the Warriors following a contentious breakup that saw him suspended by Miami three times in his final weeks with the team.",
      "He wasn\u2019t happy with the Heat, not getting an extension and had issues with his role. The Heat weren\u2019t happy with how he missed about 25% of their games during his tenure with the club and how he took his complaints public in the final months.",
      "Butler got his extension \u2014 two years, $111 million \u2014 from the Warriors, and Golden State was 16-3 in his first 19 appearances with the team entering Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always painted as the bad guy,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve always been a problem. We\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t got nothing to say. I\u2019m not mad at being a bad guy. It\u2019s all the way everything\u2019s portrayed. Some people talk to the media, some people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been one to tell my side of the story to almost anybody. Let everybody think that this is what happened. We\u2019ll ride with it.\u201d",
      "Fans, as they tend to be when a top player leaves their team, have not been shy about hiding their anger with Butler on social media. Butler knows things didn\u2019t end well in his Miami tenure, though notes that he believes there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around for the messy breakup.",
      "\u201cI wonder if they look at the Heat the same way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like I was the one who was doing everything. It\u2019s got to be 50-50, maybe 51-49 \u2014 49 towards them, 51 towards me. But there\u2019s no way that I was the cause of all of this.\u201d",
      "Butler wound up being suspended for a total of 14 Heat games before the trade. But the Heat have a tradition of welcoming back players who were All-Stars or champions with the team; Butler was an All-Star in Miami who led the team to three Eastern Conference finals berths and two trips to the NBA Finals.",

Three-time batting champion Luis Arr\u00e1ez and Bo Bichette, who twice led the American League in hits, could also be first-time free agents.",

      "Here are some of the players eligible for free agency after this year\u2019s World Series:",
      "Guerrero, who will make $28.5 million this season, hit a career-best .323 last year with a .940 OPS, 30 homers and 103 RBIs in his fourth consecutive All-Star season. Over six seasons with the Blue Jays, he has a .288 average with 160 homers and 507 RBIs in 819 games. He finished second in the 2021 AL MVP voting behind unanimous choice Ohtani.",
      "Houston clearly wasn't planning to pay the price to keep Tucker in free agency, so the Astros traded the three-time All-Star and Gold Glove-winning right fielder to Chicago in December for a third baseman, starting pitcher and top prospect outfielder that are all under team control for multiple seasons. The 28-year-old Tucker was limited to 78 games last year because of a fractured right shin, and still hit 23 homers. He had a combined 59 homers, 219 RBIs and 55 stolen bases in 2022-23.",
      "The 29-year-old Cease has 130 starts over the last four seasons, twice finishing in the top four in Cy Young Award voting. He was the AL runner-up behind unanimous winner Justin Verlander while with White Sox in 2022, and fourth in the NL last year when 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts after being traded to the playoff-bound Padres during spring training from a Chicago team that went on to lose 121 games. Cease has 1,016 career strikeouts in 847 1/3 innings.",
      "One of the game's best left-handed starters, the 31-year-old Valdez has a 68-41 career record and is Houston's opening-day starter for the fourth year in a row. He was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA in 28 games last season, his fifth in a row to finish with a winning record. The workhorse threw a no-hitter in 2023 and averaged more than 191 innings the past three years.",
      "The 29-year-old Gallen, 14-6 last year, is 43-19 with a 3.20 ERA in 93 starts the past three seasons. Arizona got him his rookie season in 2019 when it traded Jazz Chisholm Jr. to Miami. The Diamondbacks just gave 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes a $210 million, six-year deal, the richest in franchise history. That could significantly impact whether they will also be able to keep Gallen, twice a top-five finisher in Cy Young voting.",
      "Arr\u00e1ez has back-to-back 200-hit seasons, part of three batting titles in a row while finishing each of those seasons with a different team. The Padres acquired him last year in a midseason trade from Miami, which got him from Minnesota after his first batting title with the Twins in 2022. He goes into this season with a .323 career average and only 194 strikeouts in 2,858 career plate appearances.",
      "A calf injury and then a broken right middle finger limited Bichette to 81 games last season, and the 27-year-old two-time All-Star hit a career-low .225 with only four homers. Before that, he led the AL in hits in 2021 and 2022, and batted .306 in 2023 during his third consecutive 20-homer season.",
      "Ozuna, who turns 35 next November, played in all 162 games for the first time last year and was an All-Star for the third time \u2014 first since 2016. He has 79 homers and 204 RBIs over the past two years.",
      "Bieber had 20 strikeouts in 12 scoreless innings last season before Tommy John surgery and becoming a free agent for the first time. Cleveland re-signed the 2020 AL Cy Young winner even though he won\u2019t pitch until later this season, during which the pitcher with a 62-32 career record turns 30. He does have a $16 million player option for 2026.",
      "34-year-old catcher J.T. Realmuto, 32-year-old slugger Kyle Schwarber and 29-year-old left-handed starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez are going into the final seasons of their contracts with the Phillies after being key figures for three consecutive playoff seasons. That began with that 2022 NL pennant that ended a decade-long postseason drought. Schwarber has 131 homers and 302 RBIs in that three-season span, along with 318 walks and 612 strikeouts.",

      "While the stars are shining on the game's biggest stage, the smaller schools are not. There weren't any major upsets or Cinderella stories heading into the second week of the women's NCAA Tournament. For the first time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams, no team seeded 11th or lower advanced out the first round.",

      "As usually is the case, the top 12 women's teams in the NCAA Tournament all advanced to the Sweet 16 which begins Friday. Bueckers, Hidalgo and Betts have led the way for their teams to advance.",
      "Bueckers, who is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft, played her final game at home and put on a show, tying her career high with 34 points. Hidalgo has helped Notre Dame regain its dominant form after the Irish slumped at the end of the regular season and conference tournament.",

      "The Gamecocks felt they should have been the overall top seed in the tournament \u2014 but weren't. Then Indiana implied the Gamecocks were vulnerable this year without that dominant post player they have had in the previous championship runs.",
      "Well, they're back in the Sweet 16 with depth and a balanced attack. The Gamecocks reserves scored an NCAA record 66 points in their opening win over Tennessee Tech.",

Until this year, never had three No. 5 seeds advanced when playing on an opponents home court. Three five seeds did advance in 2021, but that year the entire tournament was played in Texas due to the coronavirus.",

    "story": [
      "Viktor Hovland can sound like a player who is bent on perfection",
      "Golf doesn't have to be that complicated. Viktor Hovland only makes it sound that way.",
      "Hovland was confounding as ever at the Valspar Championship. His confidence was so low that he arrived at Innisbrook uncertain if he was even going to play, and then five days later he delivered two clutch swings during the toughest stretch on the Copperhead course to rally for a one-shot victory he never saw coming.",
      "Only the trophy was satisfying.",
      "\u201cYeah, it's still not great,\u201d he said when asked if he was happy with his swing.",
      "Hovland rarely is. And that's why the 27-year-old Norwegian star could say without sounding offensive how proud he was to win on such a tough golf course \u201cwith not my best stuff.\u201d",
      "There is constant searching, not just to win but to hit shots the way he expects. Hovland has questions and he wants answers, and he won't stop looking until he finds them.",
      "He is not wired like Dustin Johnson, who made a career-defining decision to go from hitting a draw to hitting a fade. After winning the U.S. Open and a World Golf Championship in consecutive starts in 2016, Johnson was asked how he went about making such a big change.",
      "\u201cWell, I was just struggling with the draw to get it in the fairway,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to hit a fade.' And I started hitting a fade.\u201d",
      "Simple, right?",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have had the same swing coach since they were about 8. Hovland has made 11 coaching changes since leaving Oklahoma State in 2019, some of them brought back on more than one occasion.",
      "What hasn't changed is his mission \u2014 to hit pure shots \u2014 no matter how many detours.",
      "Hovland reached what looked like the summit in August 2023 when he had a 65-61 weekend at Olympia Fields to win the BMW Championship, and then a 66-63 weekend at East Lake to win the Tour Championship and capture the FedEx Cup. He went 3-1-1 at the Ryder Cup, including partnering with Ludvig Aberg for a 9-and-7 win over Scheffler and Brooks Koepka.",
      "He returned from a winter's break in Norway and felt lost again.",
      "It was at Bay Hill a year ago when Hovland was asked the difference between winning without his best stuff or hitting it great and finishing fifth.",
      "\u201cI guess that\u2019s kind of the insane part of my brain is that I just enjoy flushing a golf shot,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re out here to compete and win tournaments. But I really just cherish being able to hit the shots exactly the way I want to. I think it\u2019s a better predictor of how you\u2019re going to play in the future.\u201d",
      "Therein lies the secret. He can win without his best stuff because he's very good. What he lacks is consistently strong finishes. He has never gone more than five straight tournaments in the top 10, which pales compared with the elite in the game.",
      "But he can contend out of nowhere, such as his third place in the PGA Championship last year at Valhalla when he wondered why he even bothered showing up. That wasn't a threat, more a state of his mind. He also was runner-up at a FedEx Cup playoff event last year.",
      "He doesn't doubt his ability, only what he has referred to as the \u201cmachinery.\u201d",
      "Perfection in golf is something to chase, not attain. That's why Hovland was amused at the label of being a perfectionist.",
      "\u201cI guess you can use that word to describe it,\u201d he said. \"I just view it as if you put your heart and soul into doing something, you might as well do it right. I\u2019ve swung the club extremely well and I think my ball striking has been really, really good over a long period of time. And then when it\u2019s not doing that, I\u2019m going to work on that, I\u2019m going to figure it out.",
      "\u201cI find it kind of weird that we\u2019re professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, \u2018Oh he\u2019s a perfectionist, he\u2019s out on the perimeter searching too much.\u2019 That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments.\"",
      "That's worked out just fine for Bryson DeChambeau, renowned for going down rabbit holes and leaving enough bread crumbs to find his way out if needed.",
      "Hovland won with intelligent course management and good fortune. He could feel the club being out of position at the top, forcing him to try to save it on the way down. The timing worked in his favor at Innisbrook, particularly that 7-iron to 5 feet on the 16th hole Sunday.",
      "And so the trophy from the Valspar Championship is in hand \u2014 his 11th worldwide \u2014 and the search continues. He is back with Grant Waite (for the second time), and the immediate goal is to be ready for the Masters. He\u2019s not sure the swing he had at Innisbrook will work at Augusta National.",
      "The chase continues, with no apologies.",
      "\u201cWhen you're struggling with something, it's just problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd problems are usually a lack of information. I would encourage people to go out and seek more information and try it out for yourselves. See if it helps your problems. And if it doesn't, then you've got to seek more answers. And you keep going and keep going.\u201d",

      "STANFORD, Calif. -- Stanford fired football coach Troy Taylor following a report last week that he had been investigated twice for allegedly mistreating staffers.",
      "General manager Andrew Luck announced the decision on Tuesday in his first major move since taking over in his role running the entire football program.",
      "\u201cSince beginning my role as general manager, I have been thoroughly assessing the entire Stanford football program,\u201d Luck said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIt has been clear that certain aspects of the program need change. Additionally, in recent days, there has been significant attention to Stanford investigations in previous years related to coach Taylor. After continued consideration it is evident to me that our program needs a reset. In consultation with university leadership I no longer believe that coach Taylor is the right coach to lead our football program.\u201d",
      "ESPN reported last week that Taylor had been investigated twice since taking over before the 2023 season over allegations of hostile and aggressive behavior, as well as personal attacks, against female staff members.",
      "Both investigations determined that Taylor\u2019s treatment of employees, particularly of women, was inconsistent with Stanford\u2019s standards, according to ESPN.",
      "The second investigation concluded that Taylor retaliated against a compliance staffer who had found seven minor NCAA infractions by \u201cseeking her removal from her assigned duties.\u201d",
      "The report said investigators had never encountered \u201cthis palpable level of animosity and disdain\u201d for a university compliance office, according to ESPN.",
      "Luck thanked Taylor for his time but said it was important to instill the proper culture at Stanford.",
      "\u201cWe have powerful traditions, incredible student-athletes, and a vision for the future that demonstrates our strong potential as a program,\u201d Luck said. \"This vision includes an emphasis on a positive, winning, and inclusive culture. I am confident that we will return Stanford to the top echelon of college football.\u201d",
      "Luck was hired last November to oversee the football program and he reports directly to school President Jonathan Levin. Athletic director Bernard Muir announced last month that he is leaving at the end of the academic year and Stanford is looking for a replacement.",
      "But Luck will be in charge of the football program and now needs to find a coach who can get the Cardinal back to being competitive nationally.",
      "From Luck's first season as starting quarterback in 2009 through the 2018 season, the Cardinal were tied for the sixth most wins in FBS, playing in three Rose Bowls and two other BCS bowls in a 10-year span.",
      "But Stanford is 20-46 in six seasons since then, with its .303 winning percentage ranking second worst to Vanderbilt among all power conference teams in that span.",
      "Taylor was hired after David Shaw stepped down in 2022 after his second straight 3-9 season. Taylor, who had helped build Sacramento State into an FCS power, went 3-9 in each of his two seasons with the Cardinal. Stanford went just 1-10 at home against FBS opponents under Taylor.",

      "Houston coach Kelvin Sampson knows his team can always rely on defense to win games",
      "Houston and Gonzaga met in a second-round NCAA Tournament matchup last weekend in Wichita, Kansas, that could as easily have been played in the Final Four, the way Kelvin Sampson's and Mark Few's teams had played throughout the season.",
      "The Cougars were No. 1 in scoring defense, more than a half-point better than the next-best team. The Bulldogs were No. 2 in scoring offense, trailing only Alabama in putting up nearly 87 points per game.",
      "Yet one of the biggest reasons that Houston was able to advance to the Sweet 16 with an 81-76 victory over the Bulldogs was its ability to play any style of basketball. Sure, the Cougars managed to hold Gonzaga nearly 10 points below its season average, but they also ramped up their own scoring, proving that they are more than just a bunch of defensive stoppers.",
      "\u201cJust win and advance,\u201d Sampson said afterward. \u201cDo what it takes. That's all that matters.\u201d",
      "Throughout the 68-team field, those that were able to survive the first weekend were often those that were willing to change things up if the moment dictated it. The defensive dynamo was able to get into transition and pile up points, or the team that loves to score buckled down at the other end of the floor, making life difficult for its unsuspecting opponent.",
      "That has been the case with Mississippi so far in the tournament.",
      "The Rebels rolled into the postseason in the top 50 nationally in scoring, but their defense was middling at best: 175th out of the 364 teams in men's Division I basketball. Yet the same bunch who scored 98 points against Kentucky and 100 against Oral Roberts in the regular season stifled North Carolina in a 71-64 first-round win, then held Iowa State below its season scoring average in a 91-78 victory that pushed Ole Miss into the regional semifinals.",
      "\u201cTheir defensive versatility is terrific,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger marveled afterward. \u201cTheir switch ability \u2014 guards on bigs, bigs on guards. They do a great job. Their defense really tries to frustrate you by not allowing the ball to get in the paint, and trying to keep it on one side of the floor. And when they're at their best, they're doing that really well.\u201d",
      "It will take Ole Miss doing it at their best with Michigan State up next; the Spartans are among the most versatile of any team left. They are top 50 in both scoring and defense, and they showed it off last weekend, putting up 87 points against Bryant and holding New Mexico to 63 in a pair of wins.",
      "\u201cWe're just a team that can play multiple ways,\u201d the Spartans' Jaden Akins said.",
      "So is Duke, which was fourth nationally in scoring and sixth in scoring defense. And when you have that combination, the results in the opening weekend were not surprising: 93-49 over Mount St. Mary's and 89-66 over Baylor.",
      "Kentucky was sixth nationally in scoring this season, but coach Mark Pope's bunch \u2014 315th in scoring defense \u2014 played a more patient game with plenty of success in a 76-57 first-round win over Wofford. It wasn't a surprise that Arizona averaged 90 points in wins over Akron and Oregon, but it may have been that the Wildcats held the Zips to just 65 in the first round.",
      "Then there's Alabama, which looked every bit like the nation's highest-scoring team in a tougher-than-expected first-round win over Robert Morris and a second-round blitz of Saint Mary's. But the Crimson Tide also looked a lot like, say, Houston the way it defended the Gaels, holding them to just 66 points in advancing to the Sweet 16.",
      "That's where the Crimson Tide will face BYU, a team that plays much more like itself.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to say it\u2019s refreshing to go against somebody that plays like us,\u201d Tide coach Nate Oats said, \"because I think we\u2019re really tough to guard, and we\u2019ve led the country in scoring the last two years. I don\u2019t think anybody is saying it\u2019s refreshing to play Alabama, whoever is running the defense for the other team. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not such a smash-mouth game like playing football out there like some of these teams, but they\u2019re not easy to cover.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to really lock in and coaches are going to have to really do a good job getting our guys ready and then our guys are going to have to execute what the plan is, whatever we decide to put in.\u201d",

      "Once soccer\u2019s most powerful men, former FIFA president Blatter and former UEFA president Platini were acquitted for a second time in a case now in its 10th year on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of more than $2 million of FIFA money in 2011.",
      "Blatter, now aged 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers on his desk or held his left hand over his mouth.",
      "Only when the 55-minute verdict statement was over did Blatter smile before reaching across to shake his lawyer's hand. Blatter then shared a long hug with his daughter, Corinne.",
      "\u201cYou have seen my daughter was coming with tears because she believed in (her) father and I believed in myself,\u201d said Blatter, who spoke of a sword of Damocles being removed from over his head. \u201cTo wait such a long time affects the person and my family was very much affected.\"",
      "Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.",
      "\u201cThis persecution by FIFA and some Swiss federal prosecutors for 10 years is now finished, is now totally finished,\" Platini said leaving the court, insisting his honor was restored. \"So I\u2019m very happy.\u201d",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years. The indictment alleged the payment \u201cdamaged FIFA\u2019s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini.\u201d",
      "\u201cMichel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,\u201d his lawyer Dominic Nellen said in a statement. \u201dAfter two acquittals, even the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland must realize that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed.\"",
      "A further appeal to the Swiss supreme court can be filed by the prosecutors' office, which said in a statement it \u201cwill decide about how to further proceed.\u201d",
      "Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that ultimately came to nothing in court yet totally altered world soccer body FIFA.",
      "The legal case swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.",
      "Blatter approved FIFA paying 2 million Swiss francs (now $2.21 million) to France soccer great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential advisor from 1998-2002.",
      "The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly 9\u00bd years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of the two men.",
      "That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.",
      "With Platini soon suspended and banned by FIFA, European soccer body UEFA ran his long-time secretary general Gianni Infantino as its election candidate. Infantino was a surprise winner in February 2016 and is set to lead FIFA until at least 2031.",
      "Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter\u2019s reputation likely always will be tied to leading FIFA during corruption crises that took down a swath of senior soccer officials worldwide.",
      "Platini, one of soccer\u2019s greatest players and later Blatter\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in soccer politics, never did get the FIFA presidency he often called his destiny.",
      "Neither Blatter nor Platini has worked in soccer since they were suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in October 2015. They were later banned and failed to overturn the bans in separate appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2016.",
      "\u201dThe criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini, although no incriminating evidence was ever presented,\" Nellen said, suggesting further legal action \"against those responsible for the criminal proceedings.\u201d",
      "Platini\u2019s ban expired in 2019 and Blatter was given a subsequent ban by FIFA in 2021 months before his first was due to end.",
      "Blatter is exiled from soccer until late in 2028 \u2014 when he will be 92 \u2014 because of an ethics prosecution of alleged self-dealing in eight-figure management bonuses paid for successfully organizing the men\u2019s World Cup in 2010 and 2014.",
      "The verdict was given Tuesday in a low-key provincial courthouse where a four-day trial was held three weeks ago.",
      "Blatter and Platini have claimed at five different judicial bodies \u2014 twice at FIFA, then the Court of Arbitration for Sport and now two Swiss federal criminal courts \u2014 that they had a verbal \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to one day settle the unpaid and non-contracted salary.",
      "Platini was a storied former captain and coach of the France national term when he worked to help Blatter get elected to lead FIFA in Paris on the eve of the 1998 World Cup he organized.",
      "The two men said Platini agreed to be a presidential adviser on an annual salary of 300,000 Swiss francs (now $340,000) through 2002. They claim there was a verbal deal to later get the balance of 1 million Swiss francs for each year that FIFA could not pay at the time.",
      "Platini started asking for the money early in 2010, citing seven-figure payments made to senior Blatter aides who left FIFA which showed the soccer body could afford to pay him. The payment was finally made in February 2011.",
      "Details of the payment only emerged in the crisis that hit FIFA in May 2015 when U.S. federal investigators unsealed a sweeping investigation of international soccer officials. Swiss authorities made early-morning arrests at hotels in Zurich before seizing FIFA financial and business records.",
      "In 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors already were handling a criminal complaint filed by FIFA. That was about suspected financial wrongdoing linked to votes in December 2010 that picked Russia and Qatar as future World Cup hosts.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "During a partial solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and Earth. The moon casts a shadow on Earth and only partly blocks the sun, making it appear like a crescent. Unlike a total solar eclipse, there's no totality so experts say proper eye protection must be worn the whole time.",
      "\u201cEclipses are just a game of light and shadow that are played by the sun, moon and Earth,\u201d said Auriane Egal with the Planetarium in Montr\u00e9al.",
      "Solar and lunar eclipses happen anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. Due to the moon's tilted orbit around Earth, they tend to come in pairs: a total lunar eclipse turned the moon red mid-March.",
      "To see the eclipse, look on astronomy websites to see when it begins in your area. The spectacle is slotted during sunrise for most of the Americas, late morning for western Europe and Africa and afternoon for eastern Europe and northern Asia.",
      "During the eclipse, the sun will slowly slim to a crescent as the moon appears to cover it and the day may get dimmer.",
      "\u201cIt will feel like a particularly cloudy day,\u201d said Juan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz-Mateos with the European Southern Observatory.",

      "Grab eclipse glasses ahead of time to spot the sight safely through a local science museum or ordering online from a seller cleared on the American Astronomical Society's website.",
      "Viewers can also enjoy the spectacle through indirect ways such as making a pinhole projector using household materials. Holding up a colander will produce a similar effect. Peering at the ground under a shady tree can yield crescent shadows as the sunlight filters through branches and leaves.",

The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government's relations with Qatar \u2014 particularly after he initially backed a four-nation boycott of Doha during his first term.",
      "\u201cThis proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,\u201d the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.",
      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",

      "Defense attorney Jose Baez urged an acquittal of his 32-year-old client, calling the proof \u201cincredibly flawed.\" He urged the jury to \u201clook at evidence, lack of evidence and the conflict of the evidence\u201d to exonerate Javice.",

      "The company Javice founded once seemed like a pioneer among businesses that cater to college-age students, who banks encourage to open checking or credit card accounts in the hopes they'll become lifelong customers.",
      "Frank, established in 2017 as TAPD Inc., was created to simplify filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a federal government form used by students to apply for financial aid for college or graduate school.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",

      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",
      "The winner will be announced April 23 \u2014 the day after Earth Day.",

      "Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such as seed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that\u2019s been touted online as \u201cnature\u2019s Ozempic,\u201d and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue.",
      "To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment's backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure of mainstream acceptance.",

Kennedy Jr., had his Instagram account suspended in 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr. Mehmet Oz accused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.",

In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",
      "In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted \u201csugar-containing products\u201d and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",
      "If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it\u2019s best to check and see if what they\u2019re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus.",
      "\u201cJust because somebody has an \u2018M.D.\u2019 after their name doesn\u2019t make them entirely trustworthy,\u201d said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology.",
      "Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they\u2019ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review.",
      "In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.",

      "\"He is as you know is a sleazebag, but at the highest level. His magazine is failing,\" Trump said of Goldberg on Wednesday during an appearance on the \"VINCE Show\" podcast.",
      "Before coming to The Atlantic, Goldberg has done reporting for several news outlets, including the Washington Post, the Forward and the New Yorker, covering the Middle East, Washington politics and other topics.",
      "He joined the staff of The Atlantic in 2007 and became its editor-in-chief nine years later. Over the last several years, he has written articles on the inner workings of the first Trump administration.",
      "It was under his leadership that The Atlantic published its third presidential endorsement in the magazine's 168-year history when it backed then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Trump in the 2016 election.",
      "The endorsement called then-candidate Trump \"the most ostentatiously unqualified major-party candidate in the 227-year history of the American presidency,\" and said, \"He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.\"",

      "\"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers,\" Trump told his advisers, according to the article. It also said Trump called fallen Marines \"suckers.\"",
      "The president denied he had used those terms on what was then Twitter and went after Goldberg's sources. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, later confirmed Goldberg's account in an interview with CNN.",
      "\"This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election,\" he tweeted.",
      "The editor has remained critical of Trump's policies, rhetoric and actions.",
      "In 2023, months after Trump announced he was running for reelection, the magazine ran an entire issue dedicated to analyzing what a second Trump term would look and said it was no different than authoritarian regimes.",
      "Trump called out Goldberg by name two weeks before the 2024 election after he wrote a piece about Trump's relationship with the military during his first term. Goldberg wrote that former Trump officials told him that Trump was obsessed with dictators and said he needed \"the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" citing two people who heard the private conversation.",

      "After the article prompted a firestorm, Goldberg's credibility was attacked by White House officials, apparently attempting to minimize what was being called by Democrats, experts and even some Republican lawmakers, a major security breach. Trump on Tuesday told reporters there was \"no classified information as I understand it.\"",

      "\"But somebody in my group either screwed up or it's a bad signal,\" Trump said on \"The Vince Show\" with Vince Coglianese. \"You know, it's a bad signal. Happens too. But seems to be maybe came in with a staffer, and it was by accident.\"",
      "\"For what we can tell, we'll know pretty much today, I think, but we have some bigger guys checking out the phones, but it's something that is not a big deal, other than you want to find out who did it and how they did it because you don't want to happen, you know, in the future; you can't have that happen,\" Trump added.",
      "On Tuesday night, however, Waltz said he was the one responsible for what took place.",
      "\"I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz told Fox News' Laura Ingraham.",
      "At the same time, Waltz tried to flip the script and blame Goldberg -- suggesting the editor could have somehow wormed his way in to the group chat.",
      "\"Of course, I didn't see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean, is something we're trying to figure out,\" Waltz said, without evidence, on Fox News.",
      "Signal registers users through their phone numbers and group chats are controlled by users designated as administrators, who have the authority to invite and reject users at will.",
      "\"I didn't hack into anyone's phone,\" Goldberg told ABC News Live anchor Kyra Phillips on Wednesday. \"Mike Waltz invited me to Signal and then he invited me to a group. I don't know how to say it more simply than that.\"",

      "Amid the fallout from The Atlantic's Monday article reportedly detailing the Signal group chat discussing the U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen, Vice President JD Vance appearing to break with President Donald Trump is also getting attention.",
      "Vance made a noteworthy statement in the chat, appearing to break with Trump and questioning whether the president recognized that a unilateral U.S. attack on the Houthis to keep international shipping lanes open was at odds with his tough talk about European nations paying their share of such efforts, according to an account by Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic editor-in-chief who said he was inadvertently included in the conversation.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote in the chat, according to Goldberg. \"There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "On the day before the attack, according to The Atlantic's reporting published on Monday, Vance participated in the chat as he told the group he was traveling to Michigan for an economic event.",
      "\"Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake,\" Vance wrote in the chat, according to Goldberg. \"3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.\"",
      "Ultimately, he supported the attack, telling Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, \u201cif you think we should do it let\u2019s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,\u201d according to Goldberg's account.",
      "The White House has insisted the communications in the group chat were not war plans and criticized The Atlantic journalist who detailed the account.",
      "\"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X on Wednesday.",
      "William Martin, Vance's communications director, said the vice president and Trump \"are in complete agreement.\"",
      "\u201cThe Vice President\u2019s first priority is always making sure that the President\u2019s advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations. Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration\u2019s foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Asked if Vance and Trump had spoken between the time Vance raised his concerns with the group, as reported by The Atlantic, and he concurred with those advocating to go ahead with the strike, a spokesperson for Vance said the statement Martin provided to ABC News made it clear that they did, pointing out the line that they had \u201csubsequent conversations about this matter.\u201d",
      "The comments from Vance are striking, given that he has been in lockstep, at least in public, with Trump, his top defender most of the time since being chosen as his running mate last July.",
      "No situation depicted that more than Trump and Vance's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month, where the three men got into a shouting match in front of the media over the prospects of a ceasefire deal to end the war in Ukraine. Vance berated Zelenskyy for not being thankful for the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine.",
      "\"Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,\" Vance said to Zelenskyy. \"Right now, you guys are going around enforcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.\"",
      "During the campaign cycle, where Vance was the policy attack dog for the president and previously said that Trump needs a vice president who wouldn't \"stab\" him in the back, there was only a handful of times he deviated from Trump on policy, with the most notable incident occurring in an NBC interview during the presidential campaign when he said Trump would veto a national abortion ban. A few weeks later, Trump, during his debate with Kamala Harris hosted by ABC News, was asked about Vance's comments on an abortion ban.",
      "\"Well, I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,\" Trump said.",
      "Since then, Vance has been more careful not to deviate publicly from the president's policy position.",
      "Following their victory in November, a source close to Vance told ABC News that the vice president was tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and would work on any of the issues Trump needs him to further.",
      "In November, a source familiar with Vance and Trump's relationship said Vance was focused on doing whatever was needed to support the president-elect and the administration.",

    "summary": "The Atlantic on Wednesday published a new article detailing information about recent American strikes in Yemen that was accidentally shared with a journalist via Signal.",
    "story": [
      "The White House has sought to minimize the national security breach.",
      "The Atlantic on Wednesday published a new article detailing purported information about recent American strikes in Yemen it says was accidentally shared with its journalist via Signal by senior members of President Donald Trump's National Security Council.",
      "The follow-up article in The Atlantic disputes the administration's claims that no classified information was shared on the group, to which editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally added. Officials within the administration are \"attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,\" the article said.",
      "The article suggested that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth updated members of the \"Houthi PC small group\" Signal chat on \"favorable\" weather conditions ahead of planned airstrikes on Houthi leaders and other targets in Yemen.",
      "The article said Hegseth also notified the group of a planned timeline for flights of F-18 strike aircraft, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched for the mission.",
      "\"THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets,\" Hegseth wrote ahead of the operation, referencing the time stamp of \"1415,\" or 2:15, according to The Atlantic.",
      "U.S. Central Command confirmed those details on the day of the strikes by releasing footage as well as other images showing the take off of Navy F-18's from the carrier USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea.",
      "The White House has insisted the communications in the group chat were not war plans, that the information was not classified and criticized The Atlantic journalist who detailed the account -- though it has not disputed the authenticity of the messages.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests,\" national security adviser Michael Waltz posted on X.",
      "\"Nobody's texting war plans,\" Hegseth said on Wednesday. \"I noticed this morning out came something that doesn't look like war plans. And as a matter of fact, they even changed the title to attack plans because they know it's not war plans.\"",
      "\"It's very clear Goldberg oversold what he had,\" Vice President JD Vance posted to X.",
      "Goldberg, during an interview with ABC News Live anchor Kyra Phillips, responded to the administration pushback.",
      "\"They have decided obviously, instead of simply saying, 'Yeah we had a security breach and we're going to try to plug that breach and do better next time,' they've decided to blame the guy who they invited into the conversation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "\"It's a little bit strange behavior, honestly,\" Goldberg continued. \"I don't know why they're acting like this, except to think that they know how serious a national security breach it is and so they have to deflect it and push it on to the guy, again, they invited into the chat, namely me.\"",
      "Goldberg criticized the administration for going after The Atlantic's description of the chat as war plans, calling it \"semantic games.\"",
      "\"They're throwing up all these smokescreens to avoid being questioned about why they were so reckless as to have sensitive conversations like this in Signal and why they invited a journalist and didn't even know that a journalist was there,\" he said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged on Wednesday that \"obviously someone made a big mistake,\" but insisted that the overall mission was never jeopardized.",
      "ABC News contributor Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and CIA officer, said the information shared on the commercial app appeared to detail an ongoing operation that shouldn't be shared publicly.",
      "In Mulroy's opinion, \"It is highly classified and protected. Disclosure would compromise the operation and put lives at risk. Next to nuclear and covert operations this information is the most protected.\"",
      "The initial story in The Atlantic only described the operational part of the message chain, but did not divulge specifics.",
      "According to the article, Hegseth later messaged the group with after-action updates, notifying members that specific Houthi leaders had been located and identified immediately before strikes on their locations.",
      "Democrats are demanding answers after the mishap as they express alarm about the administration's handling of national security information.",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking members of the House Intelligence Committee, criticized top intelligence officials as they appeared for a hearing on Wednesday.",
      "\"I think that it's by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now,\" Himes said. \"Two general officers sitting at the table and the people who work for all of you know that if they had set up and participated in the Signal chat, they would be gone, and they know that there's only one response to a mistake of this magnitude.\"",
      "\"You apologize, you own it and you stop everything until you can figure out what went wrong, what went wrong, and how it might not ever happen again. That's not what happened,\" Himes said.",

      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is overseeing the deportation case, which has led the White House to publicly attack him and call for his impeachment. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt has called him a \"Democrat activist\" and President Donald Trump has posted on Truth Social calling him a \"radical left lunatic.\"",
      "The use of the Signal group chat was revealed Monday by The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who said he was inadvertently added to the chat as top national security officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, were discussing the operation.",
      "Transparency nonprofit American Oversight filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday afternoon in Washington, D.C., alleging that the use of Signal violates the federal law that governs the preservation of government records, asking a federal judge to order the cabinet members to preserve the messages.",
      "According to the lawsuit, emergency relief is needed \"to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill their legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized use of Signal for sensitive national security decision-making.\"",
      "The lawsuit \u2013 which names Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and the National Archives as defendants \u2013 asked a federal judge to declare the use of Signal unlawful and order the cabinet members to preserve the records immediately.",
      "According to American Oversight, the use of Signal violated the Federal Records Act, and the chat reported by The Atlantic \"strongly suggests\" that the Trump administration has used Signal in other settings.",
      "\"Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "President Trump and other top administration officials have downplayed the use of the Signal to discuss the attack on the Houthis, saying classified information was not shared in the chat.",

      "Republicans accused public media outlets NPR and PBS of bias at a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, while Democrats defended the organizations and criticized the event as a distraction from the ongoing controversy regarding the Trump administration's use of the Signal messaging app for the communication of sensitive information.",
      "During the hearing, Republicans called for an end to the taxpayer-funded media as they accused the news outlets of promoting a \"woke ideology\" for younger audiences as Democrats sought to have a little fun in the hearing by questioning the witnesses on the intricacies of Elmo and Cookie Monster as they accused Republicans of wasting time.",
      "PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger and NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher rebutted allegations of bias, saying the outlets abide by journalistic standards and serve a diverse audience that includes rural viewers.",
      "\u201cI hear, respect and understand your concerns regarding bias and whether public media is relevant in a commercial landscape,\u201d Maher said. \u201cIt is critical for NPR's newsroom to operate with the highest journalistic standards. That means they do their jobs independently, and as CEO I have no editorial role at NPR.\u201d",
      "Minutes later, Kerger added: \"PBS stations are focused on the needs and interests of the viewers they serve. Especially in rural areas, PBS stations are the only outlets providing coverage for local events, for example high school sports, local history and culture content, candidate debates at every level of the election ballot and specialized agricultural news.\"",
      "The hearing, titled \"Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,\" was held by the Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee, the name of which echoes the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration\u2019s cost-cutting initiative overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., criticized NPR and PBS during the hearing for what she called liberal bias, pointing to federal funding for the outlets as the target of potential cuts.",
      "\u201cNPR and PBS have increasingly become radical, left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white, urban liberals and progressives,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., defended the public media outlets and criticized the hearing as a distraction for more important issues often taken up by the House Oversight Committee, the larger body to which the DOGE subcommittee belongs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sad to see this once proud committee -- the principle investigative committee in the House of Representatives -- has now stooped to the lowest levels of partisanship and political theater to hold a hearing to go after the likes of Elmo and Cookie Monster and Arthur the aardvark,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "Later in the hearing, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said sarcastically: \"Is Elmo now, or has he ever been, a member of the Communist Party?\"",
      "Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Greg Casar, of Texas, said: \"Leave Elmo alone, bring Elon in for questioning instead,\" referring to billionaire Elon Musk, who is the public face of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency.",

      "In response, Maher, of NPR, said: \u201cI want to recognize your concerns,\u201d noting that she took steps to \"beef up our editorial standards\" after taking her position last year.",
      "\"Why is NPR even doing editorials?\" Comer responded, exasperated, and apparently confused about what \"editorial standards\" meant. \"Do you even need opinion -- if you're a federally funded entity that's supposed to provide the news?\"",
      "\"I mean, editorial standards for our journalism ... bringing in more editors to make sure that we have more points of view reflected in every story. I've engaged in a number of actions,\" she said, before Comer cut her off.",
      "\"I've lost confidence in public radio,\" he said.",
      "While the media chiefs defended their editorial standards, Maher did acknowledge that the stations' handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story was \"a mistake.\"",

      "The Trump administration is under scrutiny after The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg said he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat that included top national security officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which the officials discussed plans for a U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Goldberg revealed the mishap in a piece for the magazine on Monday and told ABC News that he was apparently added to the chat by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "Goldberg provided two screenshots in the magazine piece and did not provide details or quotes, only a description of the operational part of the Signal message chain.",
      "Both the Trump administration and top officials involved have repeatedly denied that war plans or classified information were discussed, as Goldberg reported.",
      "Below is a timeline spanning from the creation of the group chat to what has happened since.",
      "In an interview with \"ABC News Live\" Monday evening, Goldberg told Linsey Davis he received a message request on the Signal app from White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, or someone \"who's purporting to be Mike Waltz\" on March 11.",
      "He said the invitation was \"not an unusual thing in Washington.\"",
      "\"I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Goldberg said he accepted the request, with nothing occurring until several days later, when he was added to a \"group of seemingly very high national security officials of the United States\" including Vice President JD Vance, with Waltz apparently creating this chat.",
      "\"Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be \"completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News a \"long conversation\" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing \"whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen.\"",
      "The messages went back and forth with \"a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He told ABC News at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but was still not sure whether or not it was a hoax.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see \"who was trying to entrap me or trick me.\" Then on March 15, he said it became \"overwhelmingly clear\" it was a legitimate group chat, he told ABC News.",
      "At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or \"somebody identified as Pete,\" providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a \"sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen\" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he was in his car and waiting with his phone to \"see if this was a real thing.\"",
      "\"Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack,\" he said.",
      "When the attacks seemed to be \"going well,\" Goldberg told ABC News that members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.",
      "\"That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app,\" Goldberg told ABC News. \"My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.",
      "\"I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waltz appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth \u2014 what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Goldberg published a story in The Atlantic revealing the mishap, in a piece titled \"The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.\"",
      "Shortly after the story's publication on Monday afternoon, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the authenticity of the Signal group chat.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Hegseth denied he sent war plans in the chat.",
      "\"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth told reporters in Honolulu while on a layover on his trip to Asia.",
      "Hegseth called Goldberg a \"deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.\"",
      "\"This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,\" Hegseth said about Goldberg.",
      "During an event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump was asked about Goldberg's article. \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,\" he said.",
      "Top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voiced outrage at the administration after this mishap.",
      "\"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,\" Jeffries said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who faced scrutiny over her alleged use of a private email server while at the State Department, shared her reaction to the Signal group chat on X: \"You have got to be kidding me.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also criticized this apparent breach of military intelligence, urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in a \"full investigation\" to look into how this incident occurred.",
      "\"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, referencing the scandal over Clinton's emails.",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Goldberg is \"well-known for his sensationalist spin\" and emphasized that \"no 'war plans' were discussed.\"",
      "\"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,\" Leavitt shared on X.",
      "Trump told NBC News he remains confident in Waltz even after the use of an unsecured group chat.",
      "\"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,\" Trump told NBC correspondent Garrett Haake.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Tuesday regarding the mishap. Both officials said while testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there was no classified information on the chain.",
      "Ratcliffe said he believed the \"national security adviser intended this to be as it should have been, a mechanism for coordinating between senior level officials, but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications for anything that would be classified.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson continued to downplay the mishap but admitted the breach was a \"serious\" mistake on Tuesday.",
      "\"Look, they have acknowledged that there is an error, and they are correcting it. And I would've asked the same thing of the Biden administration,\" Johnson said during a news conference Tuesday morning.",
      "During a White House meeting with ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said this incident is \"just something that can happen\" and that there was \"no classified information\" in the group chat.",
      "He added that Signal is \"not a perfect technology.\"",
      "\"Sometimes somebody can get onto those things,\" Trump said. \"That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.\"",
      "Waltz said the White House's tech and legal teams are looking into the mishap.",
      "\"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger,\" Waltz said.",
      "He also claimed to have never met Goldberg.",
      "\"We are looking into him, reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" Waltz said.",
      "A spokesperson for The Atlantic released a statement on Tuesday night following the comments from Trump and his aides.",
      "\"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and other in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans,\" the magazine said.",
      "The statement went on to say that \"any responsible national security expert would consider the information contained in this Signal chat to be of the greatest sensitivity, and would agree that this information should never be shared on non-government messaging apps.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, Waltz said he was the one responsible for what took place.",
      "\"I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz told Fox News' Laura Ingraham.",
      "At the same time, Waltz tried to flip the script and blame Goldberg \u2014 suggesting the editor could have somehow wormed his way in to the group chat.",
      "\"Of course, I didn't see this loser in the group. It looked like someone else. Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical mean, is something we're trying to figure out,\" Waltz said, without evidence, on Fox News.",
      "Schumer and other top Senate Democrats on national security committees wrote a letter to Trump seeking more information about the mishap, requesting a \"complete and unredacted\" transcript of the Signal group chat for the appropriate committees to review in a secure setting.",
      "\"We write to you with extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors,\" the Senators wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ABC News. \"You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security and the safety of American servicemembers. As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands.\"",
      "The Atlantic on Wednesday published a new article detailing purported information about recent American strikes in Yemen it says was accidentally shared in the Signal group chat.",
      "The article suggested that Hegseth updated members of the \"Houthi PC small group\" Signal chat on \"favorable\" weather conditions ahead of planned airstrikes on Houthi leaders and other targets in Yemen.",

      "\"The government's ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\" the nonpartisan CBO report predicted.",
      "The CBO added that a precise projected X date is unclear because \"the timing and amount of revenue collections and outlays over the intervening months could differ from the CBO's projections.\" The estimated projection provides Congress with a rough timeline to deal with the debt limit to avoid a default.",
      "\"If the government's borrowing needs are significantly greater than CBO projects, the Treasury's resources could be exhausted in late May or sometime in June, before tax payments due in mid-June are received or before additional extraordinary measures become available on June 30,\" it said in the report.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have arrested and detained Canadian and European travelers at U.S. borders in recent weeks",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Lennon Tyler and her German fianc\u00e9 often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day's drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.",
      "But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.",
      "U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.",
      "On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.",
      "Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",
      "Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.",
      "When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, \u201cWhere are you going? Where do you live?\u201d Tyler said.",
      "\u201cEnglish is not Lucas' first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, \u2019Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.",
      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",
      "There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.",
      "\u201cYou are angry, you are sad, you don\u2019t know when you can get out,\u201d Sielaff said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get any answers from anybody.\u201d",
      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s happy to be home,\u201d Paschen said. \u201cShe seems very relieved if anything but she\u2019s not coming back here anytime soon.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.",
      "On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur who had a visa to work in the U.S., was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.",
      "Before Mooney's release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying, \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that many British Columbians have, and many Canadians have, about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\"",
      "The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration's arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.",
      "Tyler plans to sue the U.S. government.",
      "Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.",
      "\u201cNobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,\u201d he said.",

Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an attack or catastrophe.",
      "Investigators said they believe the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The NTSB now says that any time that runway is used \u2014 the one in question accounts for about 5% of the airport's flights \u2014 the helicopter route should be shut down.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn't see the plane. Controllers approved the request.",
      "Roughly 20 seconds later, the aircraft collided.",
      "The NTSB has recovered all flight data recorders and pulled the wreckage of both aircraft from the Potomac.",
      "Homendy told reporters last month that the Black Hawk's cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet.",
      "\u201cThat transmission was interrupted \u2014 it was stepped on,\u201d she said at a Feb. 14 briefing, leaving the helicopter\u2019s crew unable to hear the words \u201cpass behind the\u201d because their microphone key was pressed.",
      "The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicate that the crew may not have had accurate altitude readings, with the helicopter\u2019s pilot calling out that they were at 300 feet (91 meters) but the instructor pilot saying 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.",
      "\u201cWe are looking at the possibility there may be bad data,\u201d she said.",
      "That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter\u2019s black box captures its radio altitude.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system that he said should have been replaced years ago.",
      "The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 hours and a crew chief with nearly 1,150 hours. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita. A figure skating tribute event in Washington raised $1.2 million for the crash victims' families.",
      "Others included a group of hunters returning from a guided trip in Kansas: four members of a steamfitters\u2019 union in suburban Maryland: nine students and parents from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia: and two Chinese nationals.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel may not have been part of a Signal chat in which other Trump administration national security officials discussed detailed attack plans",
      "WASHINGTON -- FBI Director Kash Patel was not part of a Signal chat in which other Trump administration national security officials discussed detailed attack plans, but that didn't spare him from being questioned by lawmakers this week about whether the nation's premier law enforcement agency would investigate.",
      "Patel made no such commitments during the course of two days of Senate and House hearings. Instead, he testified that he had not personally reviewed the text messages that were inadvertently shared with the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic who was mistakenly included on an unclassified Signal chat.",
      "That Patel would be grilled on what the FBI might do was hardly surprising.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump insisted \"it's not really an FBI thing,\u201d the reality is that the FBI and Justice Department for decades have been responsible for enforcing Espionage Act statutes governing the mishandling \u2014 whether intentional or negligent \u2014 of national defense information like the kind shared on Signal, a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications but is not approved for classified information.",
      "The Justice Department has broad discretion to open an investigation, though it remains unclear whether Attorney General Pam Bondi, who introduced Trump at a Justice Department event this month, would authorize such an inquiry. Trump administration officials insist that the details shared were not classified, though the Espionage Act technically criminalizes the mishandling of any information deemed to be closely held national defense information even if not classified.",
      "Multiple high-profile figures have found themselves under investigation in recent years over their handling of government secrets, but the differences in the underlying facts and the outcomes make it impossible to prognosticate what might happen in this instance or whether any accountability can be expected. There's also precedent for public officials either to avoid criminal charges or be spared meaningful punishment.",
      "\u201cIn terms of prior investigations, there were set-out standards that the department always looked at and tried to follow when making determinations about which types of disclosures they were going to pursue,\u201d said former Justice Department prosecutor Michael Zweiback, who has handled classified information investigations.",
      "Those factors include the sensitivity of the information exposed and the willfulness of the conduct.",
      "A look at just a few of the notable prior investigations:",
      "The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was investigated but not charged for her use of a private email server for the sake of convenience during her time as secretary of state in the Obama administration. There appear to be some parallels with the Signal chat episode.",
      "The politically fraught criminal investigation was initiated by a 2015 referral from the intelligence agencies\u2019 internal watchdog, which alerted the FBI to the presence of potentially hundreds of emails containing classified information on that server. Law enforcement then set out to determine whether Clinton, or her aides, had transmitted classified information on a server not meant to host such material.",
      "The overall conclusions were something of a mixed bag.",
      "Then-FBI Director James Comey, in a highly unusual public statement, asserted that the bureau had found evidence that Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information but recommended against charges because he said officials could not prove that she intended to break the law or knew that the information she and her aides were communicating about was classified.",
      "The decision was derided by Republicans who thought the Obama administration Justice Department had let a fellow Democrat off the hook. Among those critical were some of the very same participants in the Signal chat as well as Bondi, who as Florida's attorney general spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention and mimicked the audience chant of \u201cLock her up!\u201d",
      "Among the biggest names to actually get charged is Petraeus, the former CIA director sentenced in 2015 to two years' probation for disclosing classified information to a biographer with whom he was having an extramarital affair.",
      "That material consisted of eight binders of classified information that Petraeus improperly kept in his house from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Among the secret details in the \u201cblack books\u201d were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus\u2019 discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors have said.",
      "Petraeus, a retired four-star Army general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wound up pleading guilty to a single misdemeanor count of unauthorized retention and removal of classified material as part of a deal with Justice Department prosecutors. Some national security experts said it smacked of a double-standard for its lenient outcome.",
      "Comey himself would later complain about the resolution, writing in a 2018 book that he argued to the Justice Department that Petraeus should have also been charged with a felony for lying to the FBI.",
      "\u201cA poor person, an unknown person \u2014 say a young black Baptist minister from Richmond \u2014 would be charged with a felony and sent to jail,\u201d he said.",
      "A former CIA officer, Sterling was convicted of leaking to a reporter details of a secret mission to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions by slipping flawed nuclear blueprints to the Iranians through a Russian intermediary.",
      "He was sentenced in 2015 to 3 1/2 years in prison, a punishment whistleblower advocates and other supporters decried as impossible to square with Petraeus' misdemeanor guilty plea just a month earlier.",
      "The details of the operation disclosed by Sterling were published by journalist James Risen in his 2006 book \u201cState of War.\u201d",
      "Sterling was charged in 2010, but the trial was delayed for years, in part because of legal wrangling about whether Risen could be forced to testify. Ultimately, prosecutors chose not to call Risen as a witness, despite winning legal battles allowing them to do so.",

      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Vermont\u2019s child welfare agency has asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the state routinely targets and tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable for motherhood.",
      "The Department for Children and Families filed the request Monday, two months after it was sued by a woman who claims the state secretly investigated her when she was pregnant and won custody of her daughter before the baby was born. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont and the Pregnancy Justice advocacy group, seeks both an end to what it calls an illegal surveillance program and unspecified monetary damages for the woman, who is identified only by her initials, A.V.",
      "According to the complaint, the director of a homeless shelter where A.V. briefly stayed in January 2022 told the child welfare agency that she appeared to have untreated paranoia, dissociative behaviors and post-traumatic stress disorder. The state opened an investigation and later spoke to the woman\u2019s counselor, midwife and hospital social worker. The suit alleges the state received updates from the hospital and won temporary custody of the fetus while she was in labor and then immediately took the baby away when she was born.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the state had no jurisdiction before the baby was born, an argument the state rebuts in its filing.",
      "\u201cDCF is tasked with the difficult and delicate task of balancing the need to protect children from potential abuse and neglect against disruptions to families,\u201d wrote Assistant Attorney General David Groff. \u201cGiven its mission, DCF has the authority to investigate potential abuse to a soon-to-be-born child before the child is born. DCF need not wait for harm to occur after birth.\u201d",
      "The state argues that its family court system has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether a child needs care or supervision, and that the plaintiff can't relitigate custody decisions via a lawsuit. The motion neither confirms nor denies the existence of a \u201cpregnancy calendar\u201d used to track women, but says A.V. lacks standing to challenge it because she was never part of such a calendar and doesn't claim to have been.",
      "The lawsuit also names the hospital where the woman gave birth and a counseling center where she sought treatment as defendants. Lund, the counseling center, has also filed a motion to dismiss the case. In its response to the suit, Copley Hospital said it cooperated with the state's investigation as required under state law. The hospital denied that it illegally disclosed confidential medical information about A.V. or that it routinely collects and disseminates sensitive information about pregnant patients.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Weaning Caribbean countries from their dependence on Venezuelan oil and combating illegal immigration will top Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s tour of three Caribbean nations this week, a visit that comes as the Trump administration increasingly focuses its attention on the Western Hemisphere.",
      "The State Department said Rubio will push for the region to diversify its energy supplies when he visits Jamaica, Guyana and Suriname starting Wednesday, just days after President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and threatened tariffs on all goods imported into the United States by other countries that buy oil from Venezuela.",
      "Another main issue for Rubio will be the situation in Haiti, where a multinational peacekeeping force has been in place for months struggling to prevent gangs from taking over the country. Rubio spoke Tuesday with the president of Kenya, which is leading that force, although the State Department account of the call made no reference to Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, obviously, is Haiti,\u201d said Mauricio Claver-Caron, Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Western Hemisphere. \u201cAnd, obviously, we all know and we share the deep commitment to tackling this challenge in Haiti.\u201d",
      "But in a conference call with reporters Tuesday, he did not offer details on what the Republican former Florida senator would suggest on Haiti policy. Rubio has extended waivers on an overall U.S. foreign aid freeze to continue to fund the security force in Haiti, but it remains unclear how long they will last.",
      "\u201cThis trip is going to add in the urgency of the moment and in the urgency of the situation to the development and implementation of a very targeted strategy in regards to Haiti to try to ensure that these gangs do not take over, obviously, Port-au-Prince but then expand beyond that,\u201d Claver-Caron said without elaborating.",
      "Energy, he said, will be the top topic of conversation while Rubio is in the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cWe are in a historic moment in the Caribbean for energy security, which has been the Achilles' heel of the Caribbean for so long and its economic development with disproportionately high electricity and energy prices,\u201d Claver-Caron said.",
      "He said Rubio\u2019s visit comes at a time of a \u201chistoric opportunity for energy security in the Caribbean, which will improve people\u2019s lives, will improve also the opportunities and the relationship with the United States and what that means, and obviously, will strengthen our neighbors, which we seek.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump announced he was tightening U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports and would slap a 25% tariff on all goods sent to the U.S. by countries that import Venezuelan oil on April 2. But just hours later, the Treasury Department said it would extend a sanctions waiver for the U.S. company Chevron to continue to send Venezuelan oil to the United States until the end of May.",
      "\u201cThe fact that now their own countries \u2014 Guyana, Suriname \u2014 are able to have and really surpass Venezuela in its oil production and be able to work with its neighbors there in the region is a huge opportunity for the Caribbean,\" Claver-Caron said.",
      "He also suggested the U.S. was prepared to field questions from regional leaders about U.S. sanctions on Cuba that target programs that send doctors and nurses to the region and elsewhere. American officials have said the programs resemble organized human trafficking because the medical professionals are not paid directly.",
      "Latin American leaders have denounced the U.S. sanctions, saying they deprive their people of much needed medical assistance, but Claver-Caron dismissed those complaints and said if the leaders Rubio meets with focus on that, it will be a waste of time.",
      "\u201cIf they choose to overshadow this trip with the issue of Cuban doctors, it\u2019ll be a lost opportunity, because again, the huge opportunity here is energy security, economic development that has plagued this region, and the biggest challenge that we have is Haiti,\u201d he said.",

      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Shannon Elkins ruled that Justin Eichorn, a Republican, does not pose a risk to the community and that there were reasonable explanations for actions that federal prosecutors argued warranted keeping him in jail. But she ruled there was sufficient evidence to take the case to trial. He did not enter a plea Wednesday.",
      "The 40-year-old from Grand Rapids was arrested in Bloomington on March 17 after exchanging text messages with an undercover officer who posed as a 17-year-old girl and arranging a meet-up for sex for money, the charging documents say. He was charged with attempted enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution, a felony that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, and resigned from the Senate March 20.",
      "On Sunday, federal prosecutors moved to prevent his scheduled release to the halfway house on Tuesday. They leveled detailed allegations that he tried to arrange by phone from jail for a \u201cclose, known associate\u201d \u2014 identified by prosecutors as Individual A \u2014 to retrieve a computer and other items from the St. Paul apartment where he lived alone during legislative sessions. They argued that she could have concealed and destroyed evidence in the apartment.",
      "Defense attorney Charles Hawkins revealed in court Wednesday that Individual A is Eichorn's wife. He suggested through his questioning of an FBI agent leading the investigation that she needed the computer because it contains records related to their apartment rental business, not to destroy evidence.",
      "The Eichorns have four children. His wife filed for divorce Monday.",
      "When she arrived at his apartment last Friday morning, FBI agents were already there. They declined her request to retrieve a computer that she said was used for her business. A few moments after she left, an agent called her and asked her to return for an interview. She refused.",
      "During their search of the apartment, agents found a bag on the counter containing $1,000 in cash; a 9 mm handgun and ammunition; a laptop; a computer memory card; an iPhone; and several of Eichorn\u2019s Senate business cards. They said the iPhone appeared to have been reset to its factory settings, which can erase all content on the device.",
      "FBI Special Agent Matthew Vogel conceded Wednesday that the phone appeared to have been reset Feb. 28 \u2014 well before Eichorn began communicating with the undercover officers \u2014 but said they were still studying it.",
      "Vogel also acknowledged that the defense had provided a password for the computer. He said agents had been able to access some information but that they were still working to unlock some encrypted data.",
      "Federal prosecutors Daniel Bobier argued that Eichorn lied when he told a pretrial services officer he had no firearms in his apartment.",
      "But Hawkins argued that Eichorn misunderstood the officer because of the noise in the holding area. He argued that Eichorn had the gun because he was getting threats for cosponsoring a bill that would have designated \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d as a mental illness.",
      "Hawkins declined further comment after the hearing, except to say he was planning to personally drive Eichorn to the halfway house in Duluth.",

    "story": [
      "Chili\u2019s is opening a new restaurant just north of Scranton to honor the legacy of \"The Office.\"",
      "It has been nearly two decades since the workplace mockumentary \"The Office\u201d first set an episode inside a Chili's, where Michael Scott handed out Dundie awards to his ever-tolerant employees, including trophies for the whitest sneakers and for stinking up the bathroom.",
      "Over nine seasons, \u201cThe Office\u201d regularly name-dropped real places and products associated with Scranton, where the Emmy-winning show was set. There\u2019s the big pirate ship restaurant known as Cooper\u2019s Seafood House and Poor Richard\u2019s Pub inside a bowling alley. But in 2005, there was no Chili's in the Pennsylvania city.",
      "So, at last, the chain is filling a hole in Office lore by opening a Chili's in Dickson City, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of Scranton.",
      "The restaurant will be decorated as it would have been in the mid-2000s with old signs and chalkboard art. It will also feature direct nods to the show's fictitious paper company, Dunder Mifflin. In one episode, Scott, played by Steve Carell, orders an awesome blossom \u2014 a deep-fried onion with a cheese dipping sauce \u2014 while trying to win a new client over lunch at Chili's. That item, long struck from the Chili's menu nationwide, is being reintroduced in the Scranton-area restaurant only.",
      "The new Chili\u2019s will open April 7, when a \u201cScranton marg\u201d will be available nationwide for the day.",
      "Two Office actors are appearing in commercials for the restaurant: Brian Baumgartner, who played the dimwitted accountant Kevin Malone; and Kate Flannery, whose character Meredith Palmer was a party-loving divorced mother working in supplier relations. Other actors, including Melora Hardin, Andy Buckley and Amy Pietz, also feature in a promotional video.",
      "\"It seems like a wrong was righted here at around the 20th anniversary of the show to finally have a Scranton branch of Chili\u2019s,\u201d Baumgartner told The Associated Press.",
      "Decades ago, when word got out that an American version of the British show \"The Office\" would center on Scranton, some locals feared their hometown would be the butt of the joke. The Rust Belt town had its heyday generations earlier with anthracite coal mining and steam trains.",
      "The show wound up celebrating Scranton and the characters, not poking fun at them, Baumgartner said.",
      "Flannery, who is from Philadelphia, said she's happy \"The Office\" helped to reinforce local pride in the city. Scranton has hosted large Office parties, including one that drew many cast members and some 10,000 people around the 2013 series finale. Streaming services have boosted the show's popularity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like what Pam Beesly says in the last episode: there\u2019s beauty in ordinary things. And Scranton can feel ordinary to some people,\u201d Flannery told the AP. \"But it\u2019s really special. It really is.\u201d",
      "The show banked on residents and businesses to donate Scranton swag, and gave shout-outs to local landmarks. John Krasinski, who played Jim Halpert, filmed scenes for the opening montage in Scranton, making the city's Penn Paper tower recognizable around the world. The \u201cScranton welcomes you\u201d sign from Krasinski's footage was moved to a downtown mall because people kept stopping on a highway to take photos.",
      "For Chili's, building a themed eatery that is expected to draw tourists isn't the normal course of business, said George Felix, Chili's chief marketing officer. In 2005, the nearest Chili's was about 19 miles (30 kilometers) away from Scranton. It has since closed.",
      "\"Given the ties that this brand has to Scranton, this one was definitely special for us,\" Felix told the AP.",
      "Baumgartner, who analyzed the show in a podcast and book, said the new Chili's calls back to a crucial episode \u2014 The Dundies \u2014 that kicked off Season 2, Baumgartner said.",
      "\u201cWe were a failing show, quite frankly, with really bad ratings that first season and barely got brought back for a second,\u201d Baumgartner said. \u201cBut some tonal things were changed. We decided to open that second season with kind of a bang, and left the office for the first time.\u201d",
      "In that episode, Pam Beesly, played by Jenna Fischer, won the \u201cwhitest sneakers\u201d Dundie and declared tipsily, \u201cI feel God in this Chili\u2019s tonight.\u201d Pam was subsequently banned from Chili's nationwide for stealing people's drinks. In 2017, Chili's pardoned the character, saying she was welcome back.",
      "\u201cIt's going to feel like they\u2019re actually on the show because it\u2019s going to look exactly the same,\" Flannery said of the Scranton-area Chili's. \"So it\u2019s like a fan destination. It\u2019s kind of awesome.\u201d",

      "Democrat James Andrew Malone narrowly won a special election for a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a stretch of Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities",
      "MANHEIM, Pa. -- Democrat James Andrew Malone narrowly won a special election for a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in a stretch of Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities, scoring an upset in a territory that a Democrat hasn\u2019t represented in the chamber for 136 years.",
      "Malone\u2019s victory over Republican Josh Parsons in Tuesday night's special election might provide a light in the darkness for Democrats struggling to unify around a strategy to counter President Donald Trump and at each others\u2019 throats publicly.",
      "A top state Senate Democrat, Sen. Vince Hughes of Philadelphia, said Malone\u2019s victory shows the value of Democrats talking to people about protecting Social Security and health care access amid the chaos and pain that Trump\u2019s administration is sowing.",
      "\u201cAs much anger that people have, they have anxiety too,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAnd last night\u2019s election sends a message that people are going to respond.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press called the race Wednesday after receiving information from county officials that there were fewer ballots left to be counted than the margin in the race.",
      "Pennsylvania's Republican Party chairman, Greg Rothman, said he didn't think the first two months of Trump's administration hurt the GOP in the race. Prices of gas and eggs are dropping and the federal government hasn't cut Social Security or Medicare, he said.",
      "Rather, Democrats did a better job at getting their voters to vote early by mail and Republicans ran a more traditional campaign employing door-knocking, mailers and phone banking that apparently didn't work, Rothman said.",
      "\u201cWe need to take this as a wake-up call to the Republican Party that we can\u2019t be complacent and we can\u2019t just run campaigns like we\u2019ve always run campaigns,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cWe need to embrace early voting.\u201d",
      "Sharif Street, Pennsylvania's Democratic Party chairman, said Trump's performance in office certainly helped Malone and the GOP's excuses that they got beaten in voting by mail is just \u201canother way of saying that \u2018people voting by mail voted against them.'\u201d",
      "A Democratic flip of that district is a major upset. Democrats say that Trump won the district by 15 percentage points in November's presidential election over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump went on to win the battleground state of Pennsylvania by almost 2 points.",
      "A Democrat last represented Lancaster County in the Senate in 1889, Democrats say. A Malone victory narrows GOP control of the state Senate to a 27-23 seat advantage.",
      "Malone is the mayor of tiny East Petersburg, population 4,500. Parsons is a Lancaster County commissioner, military veteran and former prosecutor who boasted about having visited the White House four times and working with Trump staff on policy issues.",
      "Parsons posted on social media late Tuesday that he was \u201cdisappointed in the numbers\u201d and that \u201cit appears we will come up a little short.\u201d",
      "The election comes amid Democratic infighting and a torrent of frustration and anger over Senate Democrats in Washington, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer, ensuring the passage of a Trump-backed spending measure that rank-and-file Democrats had opposed over provisions they said would give Trump broad discretion on decisions that are traditionally left to Congress.",
      "Schumer said the bill\u2019s passage avoided a government shutdown that would have been worse. Following the vote, internal dissension burst into the open, with tension unusually high following a November election in which Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate, and failed to win the narrowly divided House.",

      "Knutson was found dead in the apartment she shared with Rice. Knutson's body was face down in her bed with two stab wounds in the chest.",
      "Investigators said Rice was a person of interest in connection with the murder, but was not arrested until March 2022 because there wasn't enough evidence to justify an arrest.",

    "story": [
      "The election to fill a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat is quickly becoming a referendum on the Trump administration and a test of enthusiasm on both sides",
      "The election to fill a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat has become a referendum not only on the new administration, but on Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become one of President Donald Trump 's top financial backers and the architect of his efforts to slash the federal workforce.",
      "The April 1 election is the first major test in American politics since Trump secured a second term in November. It will serve as a crucial barometer of enthusiasm in both parties heading into next year's midterm elections and is happening in a critical battleground state that Trump won by less than a percentage point.",
      "It's also a test for Musk himself. The Tesla CEO's nascent political operation, which spent more than $200 million to help Trump win in November, is canvassing and advertising in Wisconsin on behalf of the conservative candidate. A win would cement his status as a conservative kingmaker, while a loss could give license to Republicans distancing themselves from his efforts to stymie government functions and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.",
      "\u201cThis is the first major election held since Donald Trump took office,\u201d said Anthony Chergosky, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. \u201cAnd I think notably Democrats are concentrating more on Elon Musk than Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Musk, who is the race's biggest donor by far, has also inserted himself into the race, holding a get-out-the-vote event on his X platform Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt might not seem important, but it\u2019s actually really important. And it could determine the fate of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is going to affect everyone in the United States.\u201d",
      "April 1\u2019s election will determine majority control of a court facing critical issues: abortion rights, collective bargaining and voter access. They include decisions that could have major implications for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election, particularly if they end up hearing challenges to the state\u2019s congressional maps, which could theoretically swing the balance of power in Washington if they are considerably redrawn.",
      "In 2020, the court rejected Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his election loss in the battleground state in a 4-3 ruling. Trump had sought to have 221,000 ballots disqualified in the state\u2019s two most Democratic counties.",
      "The Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, but the campaign has been anything but. Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate, has openly courted Trump's endorsement, which he received on Friday night, as he campaigns against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democrat-backed candidate.",
      "The Waukesha County judge and former Republican attorney general attended the president\u2019s inauguration in January, has said that he would be part of a \u201csupport system\u201d for Trump. Earlier this month, he attended a \u201cMega MAGA rally\u201d where he posed for a picture in front of a giant inflatable version of the president, which had a \u201cVote Brad Schimel Supreme Court\u201d poster plastered on its chest.",
      "He spoke on Musk's get-out-the-vote call on Saturday. And he joined the president\u2019s eldest son on stage at a get-out-the-vote rally, where Donald Trump Jr. said a Schimel win would protect his father\u2019s agenda and keep up GOP momentum.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just show up when Trump\u2019s on the ticket,\u201d he said at a brewery in the Milwaukee suburbs. \u201cYou have to engage because it\u2019s not just about now, it\u2019s about that future. This presidency could be put to a halt with this vote.\u201d",
      "Schimel has also resurfaced long-debunked conspiracies about voter fraud that Trump has embraced, urging his supporters to vote early to \u201cmake this too big to rig so we don\u2019t have to worry that at 11:30 in Milwaukee, they\u2019re going to find bags of ballots that they forgot to put into the machines.\u201d",
      "Still, he pledged to judge any case that comes before him on its merits \u2014 including potential cases involving Trump and Musk.",
      "Republicans have cast the race as a chance for Trump\u2019s loyal supporters to rally around their leader and push back against liberal judges they accuse of working to stymie his agenda.",
      "Mailers from Musk\u2019s America PAC feature photographs of the president. \u201cPresident Donald Trump needs your vote,\u201d they read. Others warn that \u201cLiberal Susan Crawford will stop President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "America PAC is also offering Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition in opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d \u2014 and another $100 for each signer they refer.",
      "Republicans have argued that if even 60% of the voters who cast ballots for Trump in November turn out, Schimel can win, helping to drive momentum for the party heading into next year's midterms.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the opposition party should be energized, but we\u2019re feeling very good about the energy on our side of the aisle,\u201d said Andrew Iverson, Wisconsin GOP executive director.",
      "Andrew Romeo, senior adviser to the Musk-backed group Building America\u2019s Future, which has spent millions on the race, issued a recent memo advising Schimel\u2019s campaign to remind voters that he is \u201ca strong conservative and Trump ally.\u201d",
      "Two groups funded by Musk have so far spent more than $14 million on the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice \u2014 with plans to spend around $20 million total.",
      "Musk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on Thursday, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel\u2019s campaign.",
      "Under Wisconsin law, contributions to candidates are capped, but candidates can accept unlimited cash from state parties, which in turn can accept unlimited cash from donors.",
      "His spending has helped make the race the most expensive judicial election in the nation\u2019s history, with more than $73 million spent so far, according to the Brennan Center, breaking the record set by another Wisconsin Supreme Court race two years ago.",
      "Crawford has also received her own support from billionaires, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Democrats are hoping to channel their voters\u2019 outrage at the Trump administration by casting the race as an opportunity to stand up to Musk. After nearly a decade of running against the president, they see Musk as a potentially more divisive figure who can motivate their base voters to turn out.",
      "\u201cThis race is the first real test point in the country on Elon Musk and his influence on our politics, and voters want an opportunity to push back on that and the influence he is trying to make on Wisconsin and the rest of country,\u201d said Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman.",
      "State Democrats have hosted a series of anti-Musk town halls, including one featuring former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and featured Musk heavily in ads.",
      "Crawford has also seized on Musk, going as far as to refer to her opponent as \u201cElon Schimel\u201d during a recent debate.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let Elon buy the Supreme Court,\u201d read billboards paid for the state Democratic party that depict Musk as Schimel\u2019s puppeteer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many people who are desperate for a way to fight back against what Trump and Musk are doing nationally,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chair, and see the race as an \u201copportunity to punch back.\u201d",
      "Wikler said the party had seen an \u201cexplosive surge\u201d in grassroots and small-donor fundraising from across the country tied to Musk\u2019s involvement. Both in Wisconsin and nationally, Democrats are packing town halls and angrily protesting the Trump administration\u2019s firings of thousands of workers and shutdown of agencies. They have also show disillusionment with their party\u2019s own leaders.",
      "\u201cMost voters still don't know who Crawford and and Schimel are, but they have extremely strong feelings about Musk and Trump,\" he said.",
      "Musk said Saturday that he became involved in the race because it \u201cwill decide how the Congressional districts are drawn in Wisconsin,\u201d echoing Schimel\u2019s claims that Crawford would push through new congressional maps that could favor Democrats.",
      "Schimel\u2019s campaign has relentlessly attacked Crawford for participating in a call with Democratic donors that was advertised in an email as a \u201cchance to put two more House seats in play for 2026,\u201d a reference to the state's redistricting fights that have played out for years.",
      "Crawford has said that she didn\u2019t know that that was how the call had been billed when she joined and that nothing of that nature had been discussed while she was on the line.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the most important thing, which is a big deal given that the Congressional majority is so razor-thin,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn\u2019t be able to get through the changes that the American people want.\u201d",
      "Musk has also been giving money to Republican members of Congress who have echoed his calls to impeach federal judges whose decisions he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "He has other interests at play.",
      "Democrats and Crawford have noted that, just days before Musk\u2019s groups started spending on the race, Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla sued Wisconsin over a rule banning car manufacturers from operating dealerships \u2014 forcing buyers to purchase Teslas out of state.",
      "The case could ultimately go before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",

      "Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail for legal purposes as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes \u2014 not for communicating with anyone \u2014 as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",
      "In a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.",
      "Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \u201cno connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.",
      "Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.",
      "But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans\u2019 frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.",
      "Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.",
      "Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.",
      "If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.",
      "Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors in New Mexico's busiest judicial district have been pleading with state lawmakers to amend the children's code to address what they call an unbelievable spike in juvenile crime in Albuquerque",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Behind the wheel of the stolen car was a 12-year-old boy. In the front passenger seat was a boy who just days earlier had marked his 11th birthday. He was waving a handgun as a 15-year-old boy in the backseat recorded video of what police described as a deliberate hit-and-run.",
      "A voice believed to be the 15-year-old\u2019s says, \u201cJust bump him, brah.\u201d The driver asks, \u201cLike bump him?\u201d The rear passenger responds, \u201cYeah, just bump him. Go like \u2026 15 \u2026 20.\u201d",
      "The car smashed into a bicyclist on his way to work. The windshield shattered and the car sped away in the predawn hours that May morning.",
      "Months passed with no arrests. Then in February a video of the deadly crash surfaced on social media. Remarkably it led police back to an 11-year-old who last June was arrested and placed in custody for a series of break-ins and burglaries in northeast Albuquerque. Police also accused the boy of shooting and wounding another teen, which prompted an investigation that turned up firearms and a bullet-proof vest that had been stolen from a police vehicle.",
      "But the allegations of running down and killing a person were on another level, one seldom dealt with in New Mexico's juvenile justice system.",
      "The 11-year-old and the other boys in the car, now ages 13 and 16, were arrested last week in connection with the death of Scott Dwight Habermehl, a father of two and a successful engineer.",
      "Prosecutors said Friday that all three boys will face the same charges: counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of an accident involving great bodily harm or death and unlawful possession of a handgun by a person under 19. Prosecutors are seeking to have the oldest boy charged as an adult.",
      "The spike in juvenile violence \u2014 particularly this latest case \u2014 has shaken the community, further frustrated law enforcement and added to the pressure on policymakers to reconsider the limitations of a juvenile justice system that wasn't designed to deal with children as young as 11.",
      "Authorities say there's a perception among juveniles that they won't face consequences for violent crimes.",
      "Albuquerque police have arrested numerous teens, most being 15 or older, in homicide cases over the last year. Legal experts and authorities can't recall a case in which someone as young as 11 has faced a murder charge.",
      "Under state law, the 11-year-old cannot be held in a juvenile detention center but will remain in the custody of the state child welfare agency. The other two boys were ordered to remain in a juvenile detention center as their cases proceed, with children's court judges finding they were a danger to themselves and the community.",
      "Santa Fe-based attorney John Day said New Mexico\u2019s juvenile justice system was meant to intervene and get help for children so they wouldn't commit crimes as adults. It was designed with the assumption that kids this young weren't competent to engage in this kind of violent behavior, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously when you have 11-year-olds who are being accused of participating in running over bicyclists and brandishing guns, that\u2019s something that when they were drafting these laws was really not taken into consideration because it was a different time,\u201d Day said.",
      "There is a minimum age for prosecuting juveniles in 26 states, with statutes spelling out various exceptions, according to the National Juvenile Justice Network. But New Mexico is among the many states without a minimum age and state law allows for teenagers as young as 14 in some instances to be tried in adult court only for first-degree murder.",
      "Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman says the streets have changed dramatically since 1993, the last time New Mexico's children's code was meaningfully updated, but the Democratic-controlled Legislature has failed to consider changes that include expanding the types of violent crimes juveniles could be charged in as adults.",
      "Without modernizing the system and pairing meaningful consequences with behavioral health support, Bregman said things will only get worse. He pointed to a proliferation of guns and social media, saying it's out of control.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how they all communicate. This is how they settle grudges. It\u2019s not taking a fistfight behind the high school anymore. They\u2019re pulling out a gun and shooting at an unsanctioned car show,\" he said, referring to a deadly shooting at a park in Las Cruces on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe need to have our laws catch up with the times,\u201d Bregman said.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Saturday reiterated her disappointment that lawmakers failed to pass legislation to address juvenile justice and what she described as a crime crisis. She said lawmakers should expect to be called back for a special session.",
      "Before the creation of juvenile courts more than a century ago, children who were older than 7 were processed and incarcerated under common law just as adults would be. Younger children were considered incapable of possessing criminal intent.",
      "Along with that history, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention notes on its website that the juvenile court system also was established to provide positive social development for children who lack support at home.",
      "Juvenile justice advocates say cases in which young children are accused of murder are rare but not unheard of. In 2008, Arizona prosecutors handled the case of an 8-year-old boy who shot and killed his father and his father's friend. He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the death of the friend. Prosecutors dropped the charge for killing his father, saying it was best for the boy not to have to acknowledge killing his father.",
      "Some advocates have pushed for setting the minimum age for prosecution at least 14, citing research suggesting children who enter the juvenile justice system earlier in their lives have more adverse outcomes than older teens.",
      "Before knowing the hit-and-run in New Mexico was deliberate, authorities had warned in a criminal complaint naming the 11-year-old in other crimes that the pattern of misconduct was escalating in violence. The document went on to suggest the boy was a danger to himself and the public.",
      "Cases like this beg questions about how children end up in situations like this and what systems failed them along the way, said Amy Borror, a senior youth policy strategist with The Gault Center, a Washington, D.C.-based youth rights advocacy group.",
      "Another consideration, she said, is that adolescents' brains are wired differently. Borror pointed specifically to the part of the brain that controls reasoning, rational thought and the ability to comprehend the effects of actions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why kids and teenagers act exactly like kids and teenagers act,\u201d she said, referring to risk-seeking behavior that intensifies while in groups.",
      "The difficulty comes with figuring out how to hold someone accountable when they don't have the same level of rational decision making that adults do, said Joshua Kastenberg, a former lawyer and judge in the U.S. Air Force who now teaches at the University of New Mexico Law School.",
      "\u201cKids in the criminal justice system are one of the more difficult questions in the law,\u201d Kastenberg said. \u201cUnlike adults, where you can simply say, \u2018Well, this person intentionally ran down a cyclist in their car, they\u2019re a danger to society.\u2019 Whether they have anger management problems or they hate cyclists or whatever, they completely disregarded the right of another human being to simply live. ... But when you\u2019re talking about kids, none of that sinks in.\u201d",

      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington D",
      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.",
      "For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong \u2014 a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.",
      "That's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.",
      "While the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring the comfort, consistency, and safety of Waymo One to Washingtonians, those who work and play in the city every day, and the millions of people from around the world who travel to the District every year,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana.",
      "If Waymo's ambitions pan out, Washington and Miami next year will be added to four other U.S. markets where its robotaxis are transporting passengers \u2014 Phoenix, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.",
      "The growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.",
      "That has established Waymo as the early frontrunner in driverless technology while others are racing to catch up. Both Amazon and Tesla are gearing up to launch their own services in different U.S. cities while another ride-hailing service, Lyft, has announced plans to add robotaxis as an option in Atlanta and Dallas.",
      "Waymo's early lead in the still-nascent robotaxi market is a vindication of a technology that began as a secret project within Google in 2009 before it was spun off into a separate company owned by Alphabet Inc. in 2016.",

      "Legislative leaders from both parties will decide how to replace the painting that Trump derided Sunday night on social media and that by Tuesday morning had been taken down.",
      "When they will meet about a new painting is anyone's guess. The Legislature is focused on more pressing matters including the state budget.",

      "Bly also said no one knows yet whether Trump will get to approve a new portrait.",
      "Colorado Republicans raised more than $10,000 to commission the Trump painting that had been in the state Capitol since 2019, alongside other U.S. presidents.",
      "Sometime late Monday or early Tuesday, the Trump portrait by Colorado Springs artist Sarah Boardman was removed and put in storage with History Colorado, overseer of a state museum in Denver. It is unlikely to be displayed elsewhere, Bly said.",
      "The move came at the request of Colorado Republicans after Trump claimed the artist had \u201cpurposefully distorted\u201d him. He praised the portrait of Barack Obama, painted by the same artist.",
      "On Tuesday, school groups and tourists filed past the wall where Trump's portrait once hung. Picture hooks and a plate reading \u201cDonald Trump \u2014 45th and 47th President \u2014 2017-2021 and 2025-2029\u201d remained. Some visitors stopped to take photos.",
      "It's not the first time that Trump's attention has turned to Colorado, which has shifted from leaning red to leaning blue over the past two decades.",
      "He criticized the Colorado Supreme Court in 2023 for declaring he was ineligible for the White House and could not appear on the state ballot because of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection. While campaigning last year, Trump made the Denver suburb of Aurora a focus of his illegal immigration message.",
      "Before his portrait was installed, a prankster placed a picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin near the spot intended for Trump.",
      "Boardman did not return phone and email messages seeking comment. In 2019, she said painted him with a \u201cnonconfrontational\u201d and \u201cthoughtful\u201d expression, drawing criticism from those who said that's not who he really is. She said her portraits of Trump and Obama were not political statements.",
      "The presidential portraits are not the purview of the Colorado Building Advisory Committee. The ones up to and including President Jimmy Carter were donated as a collection. The others were donated by political parties or paid for by outside fundraising.",

      "The top U.N. official in South Sudan is warning that the country is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top U.N. official in the world\u2019s youngest nation warned on Monday, lamenting the government\u2019s sudden postponement of the latest peace effort.",
      "Calling the situation unfolding in the country \u201cdire,\u201d Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage \u201cand put the interests of their people ahead of their own.\u201d",
      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country\u2019s north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar\u2019s home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.",
      "Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating \u201cparticularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.\u201d",
      "He said Kiir and Machar don\u2019t trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.",
      "\u201cRampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\u201d Haysom said.",
      "\u201cGiven this grim situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.\u201d",
      "Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.",
      "He said the U.N. takes the threat of the \u201cethnic transformation\u201d of the conflict very seriously.",
      "To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.",
      "Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions \u201cthrough dialogue rather than military confrontation.\u201d",

      "Alaska State Troopers said the body of 16-year-old Tucker Challan of Soldotna was recovered from the avalanche Sunday by the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group.",
      "Troopers said a group of snowmachiners were riding Saturday on the backside of Seattle Ridge in Turnagain Pass, a popular winter recreation area about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southeast of Anchorage.",
      "\u201cWitnesses stated that a juvenile male triggered an avalanche and died after being buried,\u201d troopers said in a statement.",
      "Challan was buried about 10-feet (3-meter) deep in the slide that measured about 500 feet (152 meters) wide, said Wendy Wagner, director of the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Center.",
      "Conditions are worrisome because a weak layer is located about 3 feet (0.91 meters) beneath the snow surface, with newer snow falling on top of the weak layer.",
      "Challan rode over a weak layer of snow that was buried under newer snow, about mid-slope, Wagner said.",
      "When the slide happened, the center's staff was conducting an avalanche awareness day in a parking lot on the other side of Seattle Ridge, she said.",
      "\u201cThese types of avalanches, they can be triggered when you\u2019re on this slope. They can be triggered when you\u2019re on the bottom of the slope and even the side or the top of a slope, because all you have to do is break that weak layer, and then that weak layer shoots out like dominoes and breaks into the slopes,\" she said.",
      "The weak layer can be broken on a flat track, but that wouldn't cause an avalanche because there is no slope for the snow to come down.",
      "\u201cWhen we have avalanche conditions like this, as avalanche professionals, we recommend people just stay on slopes that aren\u2019t steep enough to slide, and then they don\u2019t have to worry about triggering an avalanche, and sadly, this person was not in that scenario,\" Wagner said. \u201cThey were on the edge of the slope and ended up being caught.\u201d",
      "The avalanche center has been warning people of this weak layer for weeks, and there were similar conditions on March 4, when three heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Anchorage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still unsafe,\u201d Wagner said Monday. \"We are still recommending that people stick to the lower angle slopes because this is not something we want to mess with.\u201d",

    "summary": "The chancellor is on track to meet her own fiscal rules, so why is there talk of tax rises in the autumn?",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",
      "And in the OBR's worst-case scenario, 1% would be knocked off ecomic growth.",

      "Uncertainty can stop firms and people spending",
      "Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",
      "Reeves has not ruled out tax rises but told the BBC there were \"opportunities\" as well as \"risks\" for the UK economy."

    "story": [
      "After years of explosive growth, the music streaming market in the UK is levelling out, new research suggests.",
      "Almost half the population, 32.4 million people, has now signed up to apps like Spotify and Apple Music, according to music industry analysts MIDiA Research.",
      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",
      "The Swedish company is also reported to be introducing a new high-fidelity streaming option this year, which could cost an extra \u00a35 a month.",
      "Amazon Music, which is the UK's second-biggest streaming platform, also increased its prices in January.",
      "Mulligan said that was just the beginning.",
      "\"Over the course of the coming years, expect a continued and concerted effort from the music industry, of finding new ways to get subscribers to pay more money.\"",
      "Sony Music's president of global digital business, Dennis Cooker, argues that such increases are vital.",
      "\"Spotify has publicly commented that their intention is to launch a higher price tier. I'm relying on that, and assuming that that is going to happen,\" he said at an event held by the recording industry organisation the IFPI last week.",
      "According to MIDiA, one alternative would be the introduction of \"a really cheap, entry level\" subscription to attract new users; but Cooker rejected that idea.",
      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",
      "Users who don't want to pay can already access a \"pretty robust\" offering on ad-supported services like YouTube; while a monthly subscription offers millions of songs to everyone.",
      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",
      "The change has already begun. According to the IFPI, Sub-Saharan Africa was the world's fastest-growing music market last year, with revenues surpassing $100 million (\u00a3770,000) for the first time.",
      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",
      "\"The UK is seeing breakthrough artists like Myles Smith and Lola Young,\" she added, \"but that journey is rarely about overnight success these days.",
      "\"It can take five or six or seven years to get to the point where you're a big household name, winning awards and number one albums.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:06:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Shares in technology firms have both fallen and risen sharply over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",

      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",

      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",

      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",

      "The latest figures come ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement, where she will set out her economic plans.",

      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",

      "Pizza Hut workers are accusing a franchise of ''blatantly unlawful'' behaviour alleging it has altered timesheets, docked wages and stopped payments per delivery.",
      "Glenshire Group which runs all 22 Pizza Hut delivery outlets in Scotland has been served with a grievance by the Unite union on behalf of drivers who claim they were told of changes by text with no consultation.",
      "Delivery driver, Cian, told the BBC that Glenshire had shown ''a complete disdain for their staff and their customers'' and said it was ''quite honestly abysmal''.",
      "Glenshire said it is \"absolutely committed to robust employment practices\" and said it is \"listening to our colleagues, to understand where there are concerns\".",
      "Cian, 30, has been delivering pizzas in the west of Glasgow for more than two years. An employee of Pizza Hut franchise, Glenshire Group, he has always been paid the National Living Wage plus a fee of \u00a31.45 per delivery.",
      "But he said his terms and conditions were changed without consultation or warning.",
      "He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to \u00a312.21 an hour but he had lost his \u00a31.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\".",
      "''The \u00a31.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We had multiple drivers just quit because they simply can't afford to do this job if they're having to pay for their own fuel. There's one shop that has lost every single one of their drivers.''",
      "In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\"",
      "The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\".",
      "'Attempt to offload drivers'",
      "Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April.",
      "Among the increases next month, the National Living Wage for people aged 21 and over will rise from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21.",
      "\"I have never seen something so blatantly unlawful occur, even in an industry, frankly, that is not known for decent workers rights. This is the worst that I've came across in over a decade,\" Mr Simpson said.",
      "He said the loss of drivers' commission per delivery could effectively mean that \"these workers are going to be brought below the minimum wage.",
      "\"They're going to be losing thousands of pounds a year. So, as far as we are concerned, this is fire and rehire under a different name.''",
      "'Not worth me keeping my job'",
      "Unite's grievance, seen exclusively by the BBC, also accused Glenshire of acting ''fraudulently'' by going into old staff timesheets and retroactively adding unpaid 20 minute rest breaks.",
      "In a text message seen by the BBC, Glenshire director Zibby Ghafoor told store managers ''all time sheets have been deleted for last week..can we please add breaks in.\"",
      "Unite claims Glenshire unlawfully deducted these breaks from their wages.",
      "In its statement, Glenshire said that there have been \"no changes to break policies\".",
      "A manager called Adam, not his real name, said he works for hours on his own in his store. He said it's simply not possible to take breaks.",
      "\"You do not get your 20 minutes of uninterrupted time ever...so not only do we not get breaks, we now get charged for the breaks that we don't take.''",
      "Cian says it's his ''civic duty'' to speak out even though he knows it could put him at risk of losing his job. ''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.''",
      "Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit.",
      "In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\".",
      "It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.",
      "The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\".",
      "Call to investigate",
      "Employment lawyer Joanne Moseley of Irwin Mitchell warned that from 1 April, when the new National Living Wage is introduced, Glenshire could be in breach of minimum wage regulations.",
      "\"If Glenshire doesn't reimburse its drivers for payments they've incurred in connection with their employment - in this case their petrol expenses - they will be in breach of the NMW regulations. HMRC will investigate and has the power to impose financial penalties,\" she says.",

      "He said: \"As proposed it will add thousands of pounds to the cost of new homes, threatening the viability of sites across swathes of the country at a time when industry is striving to reverse the decline in homebuilding numbers that we have seen in recent years.\"",

      "Thousands of homes have been made safe, but as of December last year, work had yet to start on a quarter of the 1,323 tall buildings requiring attention.",
      "Up to 12,000 buildings and three million people could be affected.",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",
      "In its general election manifesto, Labour pledged to \"take decisive action to improve building safety\" and to \"put a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to put it right\".",
      "Last year, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government was planning to introduce the Building Safety Levy in September this year.",
      "But in a letter to Rayner, dozens of developers said \"the ability of the industry to invest in increasing the supply of new homes to meet the government's 1.5 million target is being threatened by the imposition of new taxes\".",
      "Housebuilders say they are already paying \u00a36.5bn towards improving building safety through corporation tax and argue makers of unsafe cladding should bear more of the costs.",
      "Home Builders Federation estimates the tax could add \u00a31,580 to the cost of building a home and lead to the loss of about 70,000 affordable homes over 10 years.",
      "A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"This government is determined to make Britain's homes safer by making developers pay their fair share to fix unsafe buildings through the Building Safety Levy.",
      "\"We have extended the timeline to give developers more time to factor levy costs into their plans while continuing to support them to build safe homes, and at the same time we are continuing to work quickly to fix buildings with unsafe cladding through our Remediation Acceleration Plan.\""

      "When an economy is growing slowly - or contracting - businesses might not take on more workers or give pay rises. Lower profits mean firms pay less in tax, which funds government spending.",

    "summary": "The Spring Statement is \"not a Budget\", but the chancellor is facing major tax and spending challenges.",
    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "Live: Follow the latest on the chancellor's announcementEverything you need to know about the Spring Statement'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "Live: Follow the latest on the chancellor's announcement",
      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",

      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",
      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",
      "A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.",
      "The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.",
      "There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.",
      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",
      "\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.",
      "In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.",
      "It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.",

      "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.",
      "To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.",
      "But he got much more attention than he bargained for.",
      "Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.",
      "The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.",
      "Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.",
      "\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.",
      "Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.",
      "Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.",
      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",
      "Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.",
      "Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.",
      "And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .",
      "The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.",
      "In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.",
      "GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".",
      "In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.",
      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",
      "So what's next?",
      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",
      "\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",
      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",
      "Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "There were 8,000 more secondary school pupils in special schools in England than places available for them last year, according to Department for Education (Dfe) figures - a rise of 25% in 12 months.",
      "About two-thirds of these schools were at or over capacity in 2023-2024, despite the number of special school places rising by 5,000.",
      "On Thursday, the government said the \u00a3740m of funding investment it announced in December will create 10,000 new school places for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) within mainstream schools.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said it will help plug \"the significant gaps in provision\".",
      "An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special educational needs and disabilities in England.",
      "Those with further needs can receive legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The number of pupils with an EHCP, who need a place in specialist provision, is forecast by local authorities to rise by 44,000 in the next three years - from 229,000 in 2024-25 to 273,000 in 2028-29.",
      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",
      "It says the reason for the gap in provision is because of the number of schools at or over capacity. However, the figures may not reflect the current pupils attending special schools because of the different and changing needs for which schools cater.",
      "It found there were 92,000 secondary places across special state schools in England, but about 100,000 secondary pupils on the roll in May 2024.",
      "In a highly critical report earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",
      "It warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.",
      "The government is encouraging local authorities to help mainstream schools to set up more provision for children with Send within their own schools.",
      "Fewer than one in 10 mainstream schools have SEN units or resourced provision which provide more intensive support for pupils, according to the Dfe.",
      "It hopes to reform the system to be more inclusive so children's need can be identified and met at an earlier point in mainstream schools, and special schools can cater to those with the most complex needs.",
      "Releasing more details on the plans, Phillipson said: \"This investment is a big step towards delivering not only enough school places, but the right school places, supporting all children and particularly those with Send, and plugging the significant gaps in provision we inherited\".",
      "Elsewhere, the figures on school capacity show 16% of primary schools are over capacity, down 1% on last year, and 24% of secondary schools, up 1% on last year.",
      "There has been an increase in 24,000 school places overall, but this is falling because of the reduction in pupil numbers since 2018-19.",
      "It has been predicted the number of children in state nurseries and primary schools would fall by 4.5% over the next four years, but it varies across England.",
      "Pupil numbers in London have been in decline for a number of years and are projected to fall further because of a drop in the birth rate.",

Sussex was investigated after Prof Kathleen Stock left the university in 2021 accused of transphobia.",

      "The watchdog said the \"chilling effect\" this would have on anyone wanting to voice an opposing view meant the university failed in its duty to uphold freedom of speech on campus.",
      "Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues, has said other universities should pay attention to the record fine issued to Sussex.",

      "He says teachers need to be able to cope with stress in the classroom, but that mobile phones, challenging behaviour and pupil disengagement have become a growing problem.",
      "Stuart says the amount of stress outside the classroom has also risen dramatically due to qualifications and increasing amounts of paperwork.",
      "\"In my view teaching should be quite a simple job and if you add layers and layers of data collecting and bureaucracy it adds stress,\" he says.",

      "There were about 53,000 teachers in Scotland in 2023/24.",

      "She said: \"While the different recording methods used by the different councils made it difficult to get a Scotland-wide picture, individual council responses were alarming.",

      "Last year the EIS union commissioned research looking at workload and stress. It found that on average, teachers were working more than 11 additional hours a week, unpaid, on top of their contractual hours.",

      "Teachers unable to get divorced because of delays getting their pensions valued are taking legal action against the government.",
      "Hundreds of teachers have been frustrated by long delays that left them \"in limbo\", unable to move on with their lives or plan for their future.",
      "Construction skills lecturer David Quinton, from Gloucestershire, said the legal action was not just about financial compensation but making the government \"realise that they have affected people's mental well being\".",
      "The government, which issued an apology in December, has told the BBC there are now 620 people - including recent applicants - waiting for valuations, down from 3,062 in October 2024.",
      "\"I know a statement has been issued with an apology, but I don't think that apology is worth anything truthfully. It's a bit too little, too late,\" Mr Quinton said.",
      "In December, Teachers' Pensions - which runs the scheme on behalf of the Department for Education - said it aimed to clear most of the backlog by the end of February, with the government describing the calculations as \"extremely complex\".",
      "The value of a pension is needed by the courts to decide whether it should be shared with an ex-partner, and without which it is almost impossible to reach a financial settlement.",
      "A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is usually provided within three months of  a request being submitted but some teachers have been waiting much longer.",
      "Mr Quinton applied for a CETV in October 2023 as part of divorce proceedings and got it on 29 January this year, 15 months after applying.",
      "Although he has now received his valuation, he said there is \"still a long way to go\" to finalise his divorce.",
      "'Made accountable'",
      "He now wants to join a group action being brought by the teaching union NASUWT and legal firm Leigh Day against the pension provider and the Department for Education.",
      "\"I think it's important that the government need to realise that they have affected people's mental well being. They have affected them financially. And there has to be an impact on them for not doing that,\" he said.",
      "\"It's important that those thousands of people [affected] have a voice and the way that we have a voice is by joining this action.\"",
      "Mr Quinton estimates that the \"elongated\" process of getting the CETV has now cost him upward of \u00a38,000 in solicitors' bills.",
      "Wendy Dopheide, 60, is an English and drama teacher from Warminster, Wiltshire, and said she would also consider legal action.",
      "\"I can't overstate just how stressful this is for people like me in this situation,\" she said.",
      "\"By the age of 60, which I am now, many people are starting to look forward to retirement. I can't do that because I have no idea about what my financial situation will be when I do retire and whether I'll be able to afford to live.\"",
      "She originally applied for her CETV in August 2023 but is still waiting. She said the December update claiming that the backlog would be cleared by the end of February made her \"hopeful\", but that since then she has been met with a \"stony silence\".",
      "\"When I heard about it, I thought 'wow, I can start to move on and get the information that I need',\" she said.",

      "He first contacted Teachers' Pensions about a CETV in October last year.",
      "He was told he would have to pay for the valuation and that he would be sent an invoice. It took five months for that invoice to arrive.",
      "\"Each time I was calling up, I was told I would get a response within a certain number of days, 10 days, and never would get that response,\" he said.",
      "\"When I'd phone up again, I would say 'what's happened to my previous request?' I would get the same answer, that this is being escalated and we'll get back to you and each time no one ever gets back to me.",
      "\"I've felt like throwing my phone out the window and knocking my head against the wooden table because I felt there's nothing I can do here.\"",
      "He received and paid an invoice for the CETV earlier this month, but said that he is \"very anxious\" that he could be waiting another year or two for the valuation.",
      "\"It's very tiring and it's something that wears away at you.\"",
      "Ryan Bradshaw, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, is leading the lawsuit.",
      "\"There's a clear statutory obligation within the legislation that states that Teachers' Pensions must provide CETV calculations within three months of any request,\" Mr Bradshaw said.",
      "\"We've got people who've been waiting in excess of 12 months for a calculation.",
      "\"They've been let down by the pension scheme administrators. They've been let down by the Department for Education... and then they're let down by the regulators and the (Pensions) Ombudsman, who've allowed this situation to persist for so long.\"",
      "Complex calculations",
      "In an update to its members last week, Teachers' Pensions again apologised for the ongoing delays.",
      "It had previously explained that a judgement, known as the McCloud pension remedy, resulted in the government making changes to public service pension schemes, and calculating valuations in a new way.",
      "Teachers' Pensions said that it had been waiting on guidance to be produced and that preparing that took \"a long time to agree for consistency [across all public service pension schemes] and to ensure calculations don't need to be revisited\".",
      "In December, the Department for Education said the delays were not a result of having too few staff.",
      "Teachers' Pensions has now confirmed that 80% of that backlog has been cleared, and that it is looking at other options to provide the remaining applicants with their valuations in lieu of a CETV.",
      "'Wider impact'",
      "Capita, who is the current administrator of the Teachers' Pensions scheme, said the delays have been outside of its control and it is \"continuing to work closely with the Department for Education to complete the remaining cases\".",

      "\"The main thing is that this is being brought as a collective action and.... the changes that arise as a result of any legal action can have a wider impact than just the group of those people that we're representing.\"",
      "He urged people to speak to their own union representatives and keep up pressure on Teachers' Pensions and the Secretary of State for Education.",

      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",

      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",
      "Users who don't want to pay can already access a \"pretty robust\" offering on ad-supported services like YouTube; while a monthly subscription offers millions of songs to everyone.",
      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",
      "The change has already begun. According to the IFPI, Sub-Saharan Africa was the world's fastest-growing music market last year, with revenues surpassing $100 million (\u00a3770,000) for the first time.",
      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",

    "story": [
      "By his own recognition, G\u00e9rard Depardieu acts in a world that is no longer his own.",
      "On day three of his sexual assault trial in Paris, the French cinema star admitted that he was given to \"rude\" and \"vulgar\" language no longer regarded as acceptable.",
      "It got to the point a few years ago, he said, where he insisted no female assistants should come near him in his dressing-room, because they were too liable to be shocked.",
      "\"Knowing the vulgarity of the old world, today I try to avoid being listened to by the new world \u2013 so that I don't come across as detestable,\" he told the court.",
      "\"I am not very much at ease with this new society... I think my time is done.\"",
      "But he denies being a sexual abuser.",
      "\"I don't see how it could be fun feeling up a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I am not a metro-train groper,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of sexual assault on two women on a film-set in 2021.  Both say he touched them on intimate parts of the body.",
      "In court the actor repeated his defence: that he may have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance, but that there was never any sexual intent.",
      "If convicted, Depardieu could face five years in jail and a fine of up to \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000; $81,000). The trial should continue until Thursday at least.",
      "Since Monday the packed courtroom has been the scene of explosive exchanges between the two legal teams \u2013 with Depardieu's lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous conducting an aggressive defence aimed at undermining the credibility of the two plaintiffs.",
      "But on Wednesday it was Depardieu who was subject to intense questioning, and at one point appeared to imply that a hand on a buttock did not constitute sexual assault.",
      "\"I never carried out an act of sexual assault [against a plaintiff]. Anyway sexual assault in my view is worse than what she has said,\" he said under questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt.",
      "Smelling blood, the lawyer swooped: \"You're saying that sexual assault has to be more than a hand on the buttocks?\"",
      "Out of his seat shot Depardieu's lawyer.",
      "\"No, that is not what my client said,\" he said, accusing Ms Durrieu-Diebolt of \"trying to create quotes that can be tweeted by the media.\"",
      "There is evidently no love lost between the two sides.",
      "Mr Assous is seen by the plaintiffs' team as deliberately setting out to bait them. He in turn believes that feminist \"activists\" have been at work on the plaintiffs, encouraging them to file charges that they might not otherwise have brought.",
      "The events under discussion took place in Paris in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an aging actor coming to terms with his declining powers.",
      "It is the first time the actor has appeared in court on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and he has also been accused of rape, all of which he has denied.",
      "The first plaintiff \u2013 a set decorator \u2013 told the court on Tuesday that after a minor argument with Depardieu he caught her between his legs, held her by the hips and told her obscenities.",
      "The second plaintiff \u2013 an assistant director \u2013 said she had been assaulted by the actor on three occasions. On the first, she had been accompanying him from his dressing-room to the set when she felt his hand on her buttock.",
      "Another time he touched her breasts through her clothes, and a third time the buttocks again. After she told her superior what had happened, Depardieu allegedly called her a \"snitch\" and refused to have her come near him.",
      "For the defense,  Mr Assous produced photographs taken at the end of the shoot showing Depardieu and the plaintiff apparently smiling happily together. She said she had wanted to play the incidents down, and that she was not even sure at the time if they had constituted a penal offence.",
      "It was only two years later when she had seen media coverage of Depardieu's alleged sexual misconduct in other cases that she had decided to lodge a complaint with police, she said.",
      "She added the affair had left her in a state of anxious distress, and still today she was having difficulty sleeping.",
      "The trial has offered a rare chance for the French public to see the once-revered actor - star of films like Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac - at close quarters.",
      "He appeared in court dressed in black shirt and jacket, and leaning on the shoulder of his very large bodyguard.",
      "The bodyguard \u2013 named as Massika - was referenced regularly in proceedings.",
      "Depardieu said Massika's permanent presence made it impossible for him to have carried out the sexual attacks of which he is accused.",
      "The actor is himself very overweight, and told the court he had difficulty walking more than a short distance.",
      "\"My joints all hurt. Basically my body is bust,\" he said.",
      "In the courtroom he sits on a special box that Massika brought with him.",
      "It is white, and covered in kiss-marks and signatures from people who have given Depardieu support.",

      "Director John Gilhooly said: \"The current policy is just too onerous, and they seem to have no interest in what's happening on the stage, [or] in the great artists of the world.\"",

      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",

      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",

      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",

      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",

      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",

      "In detention - where he said he was blindfolded and held beneath a cold air conditioner - soldiers joked about him being an Oscar winner.",

      "Hamdan's co-director Basel Adra is outside the house on his phone, nervously trying to get news of his friend's detention. He tells me how he heard of trouble starting last night and came to help.",

      "\"It was dangerous. I was afraid for my life. I started to tell people to run away. We started running in different directions.\"",
      "He says Hamdan locked himself inside and tried to protect his family but realised he was bleeding and needed emergency medical aid. Then he was arrested.",
      "Hamdan is a well-known journalist and activist. Colleagues say he's been targeted by settlers in the past.",
      "Israel Defense Forces says Monday's violence began when \"terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles\".",
      "\"Following this, a violent confrontation broke out, involving mutual rock-hurling between Palestinians and Israelis\".",
      "Josh Kimelman also came to help. He's a 28-year-old American living in the West Bank for three months with the Centre for Jewish Non-Violence. He disputes the IDF's version of how the violence started.",

      "Josh, from New Jersey, describes how his car and his colleagues were attacked when they arrived.",
      "\"Our three friends got out of the car and were immediately attacked by settlers,\" he says.",
      "\"There was one who started it and then a mob followed of maybe 15 to 20 masked settlers. They punched one of my friends in the face and neck, and hit another with a stick and shoved her. And they started throwing rocks at our car.\"",
      "Josh feels the violence was started deliberately.",
      "\"It's likely this attack was planned. It was definitely coordinated. You don't get a mob of 20 settlers attacking in the way that they did without some pre-planning, and so they had specific people in mind.\"",
      "Basel Adra says violence from settlers has increased here in recent months.",
      "\"There have been 45 attacks since the beginning of the year - just in this small village, not the entire Masafa Yatta.",
      "\"That's like hundreds of attacks, every day something happening around in the community leaving us living in fright and freaking out.",
      "\"We are innocents, people living in our homes surrounded with these terrorist settlers with guns, with cars, with the army and the police not supporting us.\"",
      "Basel has just heard news that Hamdan is about to be released after paying bail, but he's heading to hospital for further treatment before coming home.",
      "Basel shows me the Oscar statue they were presented with earlier this month a world away in Los Angeles. He had high hopes such global recognition might help improve life for people here.",
      "\"It's disappointing,\" he says. \"The movie reached the biggest stage of the world, the name of Musafa Yatta became known but that does not help us on the ground here.\"",

      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",

      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",

      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",

      "For Rylance, who spent his childhood \"feeling like an alien\", it was a huge deal.",
      "\"It's literally a trophy with a number one on it,\" he laughs. \"What bigger symbol of affirmation is there than that?\"",
      "How about being personally invited on tour by Robbie Williams?",
      "That's what happened last October. Robbie heard the band's single You Again on BBC Radio 2 and instantly booked them as his support act this summer.",
      "\"It was a really huge moment for me,\" says Rylance, who made his first public performance singing Williams' song Stronger on a school trip.",
      "\"Robbie's been a huge part of my life, so when he told me, 'I've listened to all of your albums', I was just like, 'What do you mean, Robbie Williams? Why are you saying that to me?'\"",
      "The pair subsequently struck up a firm friendship, and talk almost daily.",
      "\"Robbie's like my therapist,\" says Rylance. \"He's got ADHD as well, so he can relate to the things that overwhelm me.",
      "\"And I can literally ask him anything. I'll be like, 'Robert, how long do I put this pizza in the oven?'\"",
      "But Williams isn't the only famous name in his contacts.",
      "The Lottery Winners have recorded singles with Shaun Ryder, Nickelback and Boy George (\"a mild hit in Greece,\" laughs Rylance), while Noel Gallagher struck up a friendship with Rylance after playing with him last year.",
      "\"These people have always seemed so unreachable,\" he marvels. \"Noel Gallagher is not even... He's barely even a human being!",
      "\"So to have him right there in my phone... I've texted him for advice loads of times.\"",
      "That guiding hand proved crucial last November, when Rylance published an ill-advised tweet criticising musician Kate Nash's campaign to save the live music industry.",
      "He accused Nash of posing as a working class musician, pointing out she'd attended the Brit School - which he mistakenly thought was a private, fee-paying establishment.",
      "\"I wasn't very proud of that, and it ended up in the NME,\" says Rylance. \"They kept contacting me, asking me for a statement, and so I texted Noel, 'What should I do about this, mate?'",
      "\"He was like, 'Just tell them to speak to your new PR officer: Me.",
      "\"'I'll tell them you're too busy being mega to talk to the press.'\"",
      "In the end, Rylance took a different approach, apologising for his comments and offering to work with Nash, but Gallagher's support helped him keep a level head in a tricky moment.",
      "Today, he's still passionate about highlighting the issues around working class access to the arts.",
      "He recalls The Lottery Winners' first gig, at the Collier's Rest Pub in Leigh, 16 years ago.",
      "The venue was so packed that it ran out of beer, but the band were only paid \u00a330, which they immediately spent on a demo tape.",
      "\"I don't know how we did it,\" Rylance says. \"We were really, really poor for a long time.",
      "\"We kept going because we believed in it, but that's not a realistic prospect for a lot of people.",
      "\"If you don't have any money, you can't afford to make mistakes.\"",
      "Even now, the band need help funding their European tour. Last month, they accepted a grant from the UK's Music Export Growth Fund to help pay for visas and transport costs.",
      "\"I wouldn't be in Paris right now without that,\" Rylance admits. \"They match what we spend, and we're willing to invest as much as we can.\"",
      "That's where ADHD can come in handy. Rylance is relentlessly creative, always on the look-out for ways to promote the band. On the album, he even calls ADHD a \"neurospice\" that helps him \"see solutions before problems even arise\".",
      "To that end, he's got a plan to secure a second number one album this week. Since Friday, Lottery Winners have been hosting a pop-up shop in Leigh, with free live music every day and copies of KOKO for sale.",
      "\"I can promise you this, there isn't a single band who'll work harder than us,\" he says.",
      "To paraphrase his gran, they're keen on keeping on."

    "story": [
      "John Cooper Clarke is about to become the first poet to headline a UK arena, and is responsible for the lyrics to one of the world's most streamed songs of recent years. But he has lost none of the sharp-tongued vitriol of his punk origins.",
      "To a sizeable portion of the nation, Clarke's 50-year stream of biting beat poetry and kitchen sink stand-up comedy should qualify him for national treasure status.",
      "He's horrified at the suggestion.",
      "\"I hate that,\" he shoots back. \"I think it sounds like you're knocking on heaven's door.",
      "\"National treasure? Shnational shmeasure. Nah, I hate that. National treasure? Not while I'm alive. Not unless it comes with a generous stipend. Then I'll think about it.\"",
      "This invective is delivered with a sneer, a wink, and finally a cackle of laughter.",
      "The only stipend in his line of work is the antiquated allowance that's given to the poet laureate.",
      "\"What do you get for that, poet laureate? \u00a370 a year and a barrel of sherry? Not interested.\" He cackles loudly again.",
      "Clarke has been too rebellious a figure to be considered for poet laureate and its sherry-based salary, and at the age of 76 he argues he still has time to disqualify himself from being a fully paid-up national treasure.",
      "\"I could yet blot my copy book. I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.\"",
      "For someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.",
      "One honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.",
      "Although not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM.",
      "It was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40.",
      "Many of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.",
      "Clarke has mixed feelings about the results.",
      "\"It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,\" he says.",
      "\"So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.",
      "\"It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.\"",
      "Hostile punk gigs",
      "Two days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.",
      "Has he ever performed in an arena? \"I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,\" he says. \"But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.\"",
      "It will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.",
      "So what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?",
      "\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"",
      "'Somebody up there likes me'",
      "He performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.",
      "However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.",
      "\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"",
      "Clarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.",
      "Fellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his \"spirit of dissent\", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him \"my hero\".",
      "Turner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.",
      "The original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.",
      "Wedding favourite",
      "Clarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.",
      "\"It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,\" he says. \"I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.\"",
      "The Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.",
      "Meanwhile, the poem has also become a popular choice as a wedding reading.",
      "\"I'd be a billionaire if I had a quid for every person that recited that poem at their wedding,\" Clarke remarks.",
      "He may not have that income stream, but he will have got a fraction of a penny for each of the song's three billion streams.",
      "\"It adds up, and then there's the PRS [royalties],\" he says.",
      "\"So I'm not complaining. For a change.\" He lets out another loud cackle.",

    "story": [
      "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.",
      "Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.",
      "He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.",
      "Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.",
      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",

    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",

      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",
      "There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.",
      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",
      "\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.",
      "Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.",
      "\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.",
      "Why preserving clubs matters",
      "Cat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.",
      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",
      "But without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.",

    "story": [
      "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.",
      "Those discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.",
      "\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.",
      "\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.",
      "\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"",
      "Thorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.",
      "Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.",
      "But the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.",
      "\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"",
      "His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.",
      "But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.",
      "\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.",
      "\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"",
      "The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.",
      "He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.",
      "\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.",
      "\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.",
      "\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"",
      "These issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.",
      "On Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".",
      "\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.",
      "Thorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.",
      "\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.",
      "\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.",
      "\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"",
      "So what could more radical solutions be?",
      "This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.",
      "Violence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.",
      "Thorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".",
      "\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.",
      "He urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "The writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.",
      "\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.",
      "A ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.",
      "Thorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.",
      "When asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.",
      "One said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\".",
      "For Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home.",
      "His son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone.",

      "She added that Mr Hewes did not receive the antibiotics and fluids \"with the urgency that he should have\".",

      "\"I am now much more aware of the deeply ingrained, defensive culture within the NHS. I trusted them. I felt betrayed,\" she said.",
      "\"It has been totally unnecessary. If it can happen to me, then I really worry for the general population.\"",
      "The coroner said she would issue a prevention of future deaths report to Homerton University Hospital, calling on it to share the changes it had made since Mr Hewes' death.",

    "story": [
      "An NHS trust criticised over the avoidable death of a newborn baby was paid \u00a32m for providing good maternity care, the BBC can reveal.",
      "A senior coroner ruled on Friday that University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS trust contributed to Ida Lock's death and had failed to learn lessons from previous maternity failures.",
      "Despite this, the trust claimed it had met all 10 standards under an NHS scheme aimed at promoting safe treatment.",
      "Ida's mother Sarah Robinson said the behaviour of the trust - which has declined to comment - was \"another kick in the teeth\" while her father Ryan Lock labelled it \"disgusting\".",
      "Senior coroner for Lancashire James Adeley concluded that Ida had died due to the gross failure of three midwives to provide basic medical care.",
      "Ida, who was born at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI) on 9 November 2019, died a week later after suffering a serious brain injury due to a lack of oxygen.",
      "Dr Adeley ruled her death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said eight opportunities had been missed \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "Her five-week inquest at Preston County Hall heard that many of the issues identified in a 2015 independent review of UHMB's maternity services were still evident in November 2019.",
      "The RLI is run by the UHMB trust.",
      "'Critical inspection'",
      "Under the Maternity Incentive Scheme run by NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, maternity departments in England are encouraged to provide good care by meeting 10 safety standards, including properly investigating deaths and listening to parents' concerns.",
      "Trusts which certify they have met these standards receive a rebate on their insurance premiums, in addition to a share of money paid by NHS trusts which do not.",
      "In the five years that the scheme has been running, UHMB said it had met the 10 standards four times.",
      "In 2018, the first year of the programme, the trust's self-certification led to it being paid \u00a31,288,241.",
      "In 2019, the year of Ida's death, it received \u00a3734,112 after again claiming to have hit all of the criteria.",
      "The UHMB trust also claimed a perfect 10-out-of-10 record in 2020 but their submission was reviewed by NHS Resolution following a critical inspection of maternity services by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The regulator's report rated maternity services as \"inadequate\", with UHMB's score downgraded to three out of 10.",
      "Consequently, UHMB was not given any money that year by NHS Resolution, and the trust was made to repay most of the amount it had received in 2019.",
      "'Painting a false picture'",
      "When told about the payments scheme and how the trust had benefitted from it, Mr Lock said it was \"disgusting\".",
      "He said: \"It's painting a false picture so they can receive money.\"",
      "A former maternity risk manager at the trust, Rox-Anne Hetherington, said Morecambe Bay's actions were in keeping with her experience.",
      "\"I can, hand-on-heart, say that it wasn't a case of 'What have we done to [make things better]?'",
      "\"It was a case of 'What are we going to say we've done?'\"",
      "Dr Bill Kirkup, whose 2015 inquiry exposed widespread failings in maternity care, including the preventable deaths of 11 babies and a mother at the trust's Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, also said he wasn't surprised.",
      "\"Some trusts put a lot of effort into how they can present the best picture of themselves, and much less effort into whether they're actually making improvements underneath,\" he said.",
      "'Not fully compliant'",
      "UHMB's claims are in line with other struggling trusts which have also made similar erroneous submissions under the Maternity Incentive Scheme.",
      "The Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust was forced to repay almost \u00a31m after it similarly claimed to have met all of the safety standards.",
      "A review of its maternity care, published in 2022, found more than 200 babies and mothers could have survived with proper care.",
      "The East Kent University Hospitals trust, where an inquiry found at least 45 babies could have survived, was also forced to repay \u00a32m after falsely claiming it had met the safety criteria.",
      "In a statement, NHS Resolution said \"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS trust initially self-reported full compliance with the Maternity Incentive Scheme in years 1, 2, 3 and 5.",
      "\"However subsequent NHS Resolution reviews of the Trust's evidence for years 2 and 3 following the publication of their CQC report demonstrated that they were not fully compliant for those years.",
      "\"The Trust was required to repay any funds for those years. The previously granted rebate was returned to NHS Resolution and was redistributed to all compliant Trusts.\"",

      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?"

      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",

      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

      "The government's independent spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), halved its growth forecast for the UK this year to 1%, down from its October prediction of 2%.",
      "But in subsequent years the OBR predicted growth would be higher than expected thanks, in part, to more housebuilding.",
      "The chancellor has insisted she will stick to her self-imposed \"fiscal rules\" - designed to reassure financial markets.",
      "The two key ones are not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament.",
      "The chancellor said changes in the global economy meant she would have missed her rule on spending by \u00a34.1bn due to an increase in government borrowing costs.",
      "She said measures announced on Wednesday \"restored in full our headroom\" to \u00a39.9bn.",
      "But OBR chairman Richard Hughes warned that if the US levied tariffs of 20% on imports, and the UK and the rest of the world retaliated with the same, this could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom."

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",

      "Uncertainty can stop firms and people spending",
      "Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",
      "Reeves has not ruled out tax rises but told the BBC there were \"opportunities\" as well as \"risks\" for the UK economy."

      "For many who dislike dark winter nights, this weekend will be one to savour as the clocks spring forward by an hour on Sunday 30 March from 01:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).",
      "This marks the end for some and the gloom that can be caused by GMT, and the start of British Summer Time (BST) and lighter evenings.",
      "However, the Labour MP for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, Alex Mayer, has called for a \"major overhaul of time\" and a conversation about \"how best to use our nation's daylight hours\" in a parliamentary debate.",
      "But why do the clocks go back and forward in the UK each year?",
      "The process of moving the clocks forward by one hour in the summer was started during World War One in Germany in 1916, as a way to save energy resources during lighter evenings.",
      "Weeks later other countries followed suit, including the UK, where it was named British Summer Time. During World War Two in 1941, the then-prime minister Sir Winston Churchill introduced a system where clocks were advanced by two hours.",
      "This meant that during winter, while clocks went back an hour they were still one hour ahead of GMT to increase productivity during daylight.",
      "This ended in 1945, but briefly returned two years later due to severe fuel shortages that summer.",
      "What does the debate involve?",
      "Mayer wants a return to how things were in World War Two and is hosting an adjournment debate in Parliament. These debates are a chance for MPs to raise an issue and get a response from a minister but do not include a vote afterwards.",
      "Mayer has argued that a return to what is known as \"Churchill Time\" could help save a combined \u00a3485m in yearly electricity bills - and reduce carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes.",
      "She called this \"a low-cost, high-impact proposal\" to \"help meet climate goals, reduce energy bills, and boost our High Streets by making better use of the daylight hours we already have\".",
      "She is not the first MP to bring this discussion to Westminster.",
      "In 2012, a bid by Conservative MP Rebecca Harris to move UK clocks forward by an hour for a three-year trial period failed after the legislation ran out of time in the House of Commons.",
      "In 1968, there was a three-year experiment to keep BST in place throughout the year. On average, there was a huge reduction in road casualties, but this has since been attributed to new drink-driving legislation in 1967.",
      "What are the arguments against the change?",
      "During that experiment in northern Scotland, there was a net increase in the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads, because during the darkest days of December sunrise would not take place until 10:00.",
      "In 2012, when MPs voted against it, many objections focused on the impact of a change on road accidents.",
      "Critics argued it would make the lives of outdoor workers harder and increase road accidents due to the darker mornings - although those in favour of a change argue it would reduce evening accidents.",
      "Other sources have expressed concerns about the negative impact of extended daylight evenings to health and sleep patterns.",
      "Recent studies suggested modern power consumption habits mean energy savings made by reducing evening lighting were now offset by increased energy consumption, in the warmer lighter evenings.",

    "story": [
      "Housebuilding is forecast to hit a 40-year high, with reforms to the planning system expected to boost the economy by \u00a36.8bn, according to the independent spending watchdog.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said changes including mandatory housing targets for councils and making it easier to build on green belt land could result in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by the end of the decade.",
      "The government said further planned reforms and investment in affordable housing would help to meet its target of 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "But the OBR warned its estimates were uncertain as factors such as the number of construction workers could hinder progress.",
      "Industry leaders have said tens of thousands of new recruits will be needed to deliver the government's target, with the sector facing a skills shortage and ageing workforce.",
      "Earlier this week, the government announced \u00a3600m of funding to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers.",
      "The OBR said local opposition could also delay or prevent new homes.",
      "Critics have argued the reforms could disregard local concerns, while some councils have warned higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve, pointing to strains on local infrastructure and land shortages.",
      "The Home Builders Federation said planning changes were \"a very positive step\" but the OBR figures showed further \"urgent\" measures to help homebuyers were needed to meet the government's target.",
      "Chief executive Neil Jefferson said the cost of building new homes had also \"rocketed\" in recent years, with new taxes and regulatory fees further supressing investment.",
      "The government has made boosting the number of new homes a key priority, promising to back the \"builders not blockers\".",

      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "Three ways the changes could affect you and your money",
      "There had been a question mark over whether the OBR would factor the government's planning reforms into its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "However, in her Spring Statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the watchdog had considered and scored changes to the National Planning Policy Framework published in December.",
      "The OBR said the reforms could boost housebuilding by 170,000 over the next five years, resulting in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by 2029/30, a 16% increase.",
      "It added that the number of new homes annually was projected to reach a 40-year high of 305,000.",
      "The watchdog estimated the boost to housebuilding as a result of the reforms would increase the size of the UK economy by 0.2% by 2029/30, worth around \u00a36.8bn in today's prices.",
      "The government said this was the biggest positive effect on growth from a  \"zero-cost policy\" the OBR had ever forecast.",
      "The boost to economic growth is driven by factors including higher productivity in the construction sector, more people paying rent and making it easier for people to move for work.",
      "The OBR said the increase in supply would lead to a small reduction in average house prices of around 0.9% by 2029/30.",
      "Experts said while the boost from planning reforms was welcome there needed to be more focus on first-time buyers who are struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "Felicity Barnett, from the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said many prospective homeowners were \"trapped by strict affordability criteria\" and needed more accessible options.",
      "Aynsley Lammin, an analyst at Investec, said a good economic backdrop, favourable interest rates and policies to help first-time buyers were needed to boost demand.",
      "He added that the government would also need to invest in affordable homes.",
      "Under the government's new planning framework previously developed land - known as \"brownfield\" sites - will be prioritised for new homes.",
      "But ministers have acknowledged this will not be enough to meet the government's target.",
      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building will be allowed on higher quality green belt land if developers provide the necessary infrastructure and guarantee affordable housing, as well as access to green spaces.",

      "He said he had agreed with partners at the summit, which hosted representatives from 30 nations as well as the European Union and Nato, that \"we must go further now to support the peace process, support Ukraine and increase the pressure on Russia to get serious\".",
      "\"It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions, bearing down on Russia's energy revenues, and working together to make this pressure count,\" he said.",
      "Starmer said that the political mood to find a just and lasting peace in Ukraine was \"stronger and broader\" than it had ever been, adding that \"Europe as a whole has not been this strong and united in a long time\".",

      "The prime minister said defence chiefs from the UK, France and Germany would also be meeting in Ukraine, but did not specify a date.",
      "Speaking with Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier, Starmer accused Russia of \"continuing to inflict devastating attacks on the Ukrainian people\" and said Putin's promises were \"hollow\".",

      "Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a separate, tentative deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure.",
      "Shortly after Washington announced the Black Sea deal, the Kremlin said it would not take effect until sanctions were lifted on Russian banks, producers and exporters involved in the international food and fertiliser trades.",
      "The concessions demanded by Russia include reconnecting the banks connected to the Swift payment system, lifting restrictions on servicing ships under the Russian flag involved in the food trade, and revoking sanctions on the supply of agricultural machinery and other goods involved in food production.",
      "US President Donald Trump said the US government was \"looking at\" Moscow's request - but the EU said it would not consider removing sanctions before the \"unconditional\" withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory.",
      "Speaking after a meeting with Macron on Wednesday, Zelensky said he hoped the US - which is not a part of the coalition of the willing - would \"stand strong\" in the face of Russian demands to lift sanctions.",
      "The French president said that if a European force protecting a ceasefire in Ukraine came under attack, it would \"respond to it\".",
      "\"If there was again a generalised aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would be under attack, and then it's our usual framework of engagement,\" he said.",

      "The ONS said another factor was an unseasonably high number of clothing sales. Discounting usually drops off in February as January sales end and spring ranges enter the shops, but that did not happen this year.",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",
      "The rate of price rises is also expected to increase in the months ahead, with council tax and energy and water bills all set to rise in April.",

    "summary": "People who lost savings from a collapsed investment fund say a redress scheme has let them down.",
    "story": [
      "People who lost tens of thousands of pounds when a star stockpicker's investment fund collapsed say they have been let down by the UK's financial regulator and are calling on MPs to investigate.",
      "Around 300,000 people lost money when Woodford Equity Income Fund collapsed in 2019.",
      "In 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced a \"redress scheme\" that it said would allow investors to recover around 77p in the pound.",
      "But some investors say that figure was misleading, and the scheme coming into force locked them out of other consumer protections.",
      "The FCA says the scheme offers the \"quickest and best chance\" of getting a \"better outcome than might be achieved by other means\".",
      "Woodford investors in line for \u00a3235m compensation",
      "The spectacular fall of fund manager Neil Woodford",
      "When Ian Duffield and his wife Linda, from Manchester, put \u00a3234,000 of their pension savings into Neil Woodford's fund, they thought most of their money would be protected.",
      "Mr Woodford came with a stellar reputation, and the fund advertised that it was protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which pays compensation when a financial firm fails.",
      "After its collapse, the Duffields recovered some of their money when the fund's assets were sold off, but this still left them with a loss of about \u00a3107,000.",
      "Ian said when the redress scheme was announced, they initially thought they would get most of that remaining sum back.",
      "\"When I first heard it, I thought... I'll end up losing, maybe \u00a330-35K between us, which is not great, but in the scheme of things it would have been OK, a bit of a sigh of relief\".",
      "On reading the detail, he realised that was not the case, as the scheme took into account the money they had already received.",
      "He actually got \u00a37,600, leaving him and his wife with a total loss of nearly \u00a3100,000.",
      "\"It has affected our lives. We had to not take holidays for a few years...but we're fortunate,\" he says.",
      "\"I know people who've lost far lesser sums, but the impact has been much greater\".",
      "'Shafted'",
      "Investors in the fund voted to accept the scheme in December 2023, meaning they are no longer able to access the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.",
      "Paul King from Kingston-upon-Thames works in IT and invested just under \u00a350,000 in the Woodford fund to help save for his retirement.",
      "He said he had taken comfort in the fact that it appeared to be protected.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I'm just a consumer. You do your best to provision for the future and you put a lot of weight behind the FSCS,\" he says.",
      "\"I didn't anticipate that if things went wrong that we would be shafted, to put it bluntly\".",
      "\"I feel I've got more protection if I buy a faulty pair of shoes costing \u00a350 than if the regulator of this country fails and I lose \u00a350,000\".",
      "'Nuances and intricacies'",
      "A group of MPs and peers, the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Investment Fraud and Fairer Financial Services, has now written to the Commons Treasury committee to ask for them to conduct an inquiry into how the FCA handled the fund's collapse, including how it set up the redress scheme.",
      "In a report to be published on Tuesday, the APPG will say the FCA failed to properly communicate that its \"77p in the pound\" figure only related to some of the assets in the fund, rather than in its entirety.",
      "\"Only a minute minority of investors were sufficiently engaged to even begin to understand the nuances and intricacies of what was taking place,\" they will argue.",
      "The Woodford Equity Income Fund collapsed in 2019 after a number of investors withdrew their money over concerns about the investments being made.",
      "The redress scheme was proposed by Link Fund Solutions (LFS), the former authorised corporate director of the fund.",
      "It came after the FCA investigated and three investor groups filed lawsuits over the way LFS had managed the fund.",
      "A FCA spokesperson said the size of the redress scheme did not reflect investment losses due to the underperformance of the fund.",
      "\"Instead, it covers the losses that flowed from Link Fund Solutions' conduct, which we consider fell below the required standards,\" they added.",
      "\"The scheme offered investors the quickest and best chance to obtain a better outcome than might be achieved by any other means. The scheme was approved by more than 90% of investors.\"",
      "Almost 94% of investors backed the compensation scheme in a vote in December 2023, although only 54,000 voted. It was approved by a High Court judge last year."

      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",
      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",
      "Despite the uncertainties, the OBR's judgement on the economy was better than had been expected. This year's growth was downgraded, but close to normal levels of growth are predicted to return in later years.",

      "It's a policy that doesn't involve taxes or spending yet is expected to provide a huge boost to growth.",
      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",
      "This comes as a result of local authority housing targets and council land being freed up.",
      "When the Planning and Infrastructure Bill passes later this year, which strips back judicial reviews, there should be a further increase in predicted growth.",
      "But the test is obviously actual spades and diggers in the ground and architects' plans being approved. This government is now all-in on Bob the Builder.",
      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",
      "But the cuts to welfare are very real. The 250,000 increase in people in poverty due to the cuts to health-related benefits does not include the impact of recipients getting new jobs.",
      "The Impact Assessment seems to confirm that the aim of the policy is more about saving cash than fundamental reform.",
      "In this and in other areas questions arise about whether the \"OBR tail wags the policy dog\" - i.e. is this really the way long-term policy should be formed?",
      "The big picture is that all of this becomes a lot easier if growth returns and interest costs calm.",
      "In the dreams of Number 11, while we assume the debate in autumn will be about what further tax rises are required, it is possible that by the time of October's Budget, they may not be needed."

      "Pip is paid to more than 3.6 million people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",

      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",

      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. You may be reassessed sooner if your circumstances change.",
      "The government plans more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip. However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.",

      "Starmer says cost of sickness benefits 'devastating'",
      "How is universal credit changing?",
      "The government has also announced changes to universal credit, which is paid to 7.5 million people.",
      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",
      "Who will be affected by the changes?",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that it expects 3.2 million families \u2013 a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the total package of measures, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year.",

      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?"

      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",

      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",

      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",

      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",

      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",

      "Therizinosaurs were a group of either herbivorous or omnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period, which began 145 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago.",
      "They are exemplified by the massive, long-clawed form Therizinosaurus, featured in the film Jurassic World Dominion, and were \"awkward looking\", according to one of the study's authors Dr Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor at the University of Calgary.",
      "The specimen was recovered from the Bayanshiree formation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which dates back to the Late Cretaceous period (between 100.5 to 66 million years ago).",
      "Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.",
      "The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.",
      "At nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.",
      "Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.",
      "The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods.",
      "The specimen also preserves the first keratinous sheath of a therizinosaur, an element that covers the claw much like human fingernails, aiding defence, movement, or prey catching."

    "summary": "Archaeologists say they have found more than 800 items dating back about 2,000 years.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",
      "You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.",
      "But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary.",
      "Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots.",
      "They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire.",
      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",
      "\"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\"",
      "The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections.",
      "Andrew Woods, senior curator at the museum said: \"This Iron Age hoard is an unprecedented find in the north, which will help us to understand more about this remarkable period in our history.",
      "\"We have the exciting opportunity to save the hoard for the nation and the people of Yorkshire.",
      "\"By acquiring the hoard, we will be able to make it accessible to everyone and, working in partnership with others, we can learn more about this fascinating period, why the hoard was buried, how the objects may have been used and to cast light on to whom it may have belonged.\"",

    "summary": "On social media a self-proclaimed earthquake predictor says he can forecast big shakes, but experts say it's pure luck.",
    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Dr Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Dr Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Dr Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Dr Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Dr Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "Thousands evacuate Santorini as more earthquakes strike island",
      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Dr Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Dr Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

    "story": [
      "The messaging app Signal has made headlines after the White House confirmed it was used for a secret group chat between senior US officials.",
      "The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to the group where plans for a strike against the Houthi group in Yemen were discussed.",
      "Signal's creator Matthew Rosenfeld - who is better known by the pseudonym Moxie Marlinspike - joked the \"great reasons\" to join the platform now included \"the opportunity for the vice president of the United States of America to randomly add you to a group chat for coordination of sensitive military operations\".",
      "But others are not seeing the funny side, with Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer calling it \"one of the most stunning\" military intelligence leaks in history and calling for an investigation.",
      "But what actually is Signal - and how secure or otherwise were the senior politicians' communications on it?",
      "The security app",
      "Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.",
      "Where it does lead the way though is in security.",
      "At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).",
      "Simply put, it means only the sender and the receiver can read messages - even Signal itself cannot access them.",
      "A number of other platforms also have E2EE -  including WhatsApp - but Signal's security features go beyond this.",
      "For example, the code that makes the app work is open source - meaning anybody can check it to make sure there are no vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.",
      "Its owners say it collects far less information from its users, and in particular does not store records of usernames, profile pictures, or the groups people are part of.",
      "There is also no need to dilute these features to make more money: Signal is owned by the Signal Foundation, a US-based non-profit, which relies on donations rather than ad revenue.",
      "\"Signal is the gold standard in private comms,\" said its boss Meredith Whittaker in a post on X after the US national security story became public.",
      "'Very, very unusual'",
      "That \"gold standard claim\" is what makes Signal appealing to cybersecurity experts and journalists, who often use the app.",
      "But even that level of security is considered insufficient for very high level conversations about extremely sensitive national security matters.",
      "That is because there is a largely unavoidable risk to communicating via a mobile phone: it is only as secure as the person that uses it.",
      "If someone gains access to your phone with Signal open - or if they learn your password - they'll be able to see your messages.",
      "And no app can prevent someone peeking over your shoulder if you are using your phone in a public space.",
      "Trump backs top adviser who accidentally added journalist to secret air strike chat",
      "Why is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?",
      "Data expert Caro Robson, who has worked with the US administration, said it was \"very, very unusual\" for high ranking security officials to communicate on a messaging platform like Signal.",
      "\"Usually you would use a very secure government system that is operated and owned by the government using very high levels of encryption,\" she said.",
      "She said this would typically mean devices kept in \"very secure government controlled locations\".",
      "The US government has historically used a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif - pronounced \"skiff\") to discuss matters of national security.",
      "A Scif is an ultra-secure enclosed area in which personal electronic devices are not allowed.",
      "\"To even access this kind of classified information, you have to be in a particular room or building repeatedly swept for bugs or any listening devices,\" said Ms Robson.",
      "Scifs can be found in places ranging from military bases to the homes of officials.",
      "\"The whole system is massively encrypted and secured using the government's own highest standards of cryptography,\" she said.",
      "\"Especially when defence is involved.\"",
      "Encryption and records",
      "There's another issue tied to Signal that has raised concerns - disappearing messages.",
      "Signal, like many other messaging apps, allows its users to set messages to disappear after a set period of time.",
      "The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg said some of the messages in the Signal group he was added to disappeared after a week.",
      "This may violate laws around record-keeping - unless those using the app forwarded on their messages to an official government account.",
      "This is also far from the first row involving E2EE",
      "Various administrations have wanted to create a so-called backdoor into messaging services that use it so they can read messages they think might pose a national security threat.",
      "Apps including Signal and WhatsApp have previously fought attempts to create such a backdoor, saying it would eventually be used by bad actors.",
      "Signal threatened to pull the app from the UK in 2023 if it was undermined by lawmakers.",
      "This year, the UK government became embroiled in a significant row with Apple, which also uses E2EE to protect certain files in cloud storage.",
      "Apple ended up pulling the feature in the UK altogether after the government demanded access to data protected in this way by the tech giant.",
      "The legal case is ongoing.",
      "But, as this controversy shows, no level of security or legal protection matters if you simply share your confidential data with the wrong person.",

    "summary": "Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to a chat of senior Trump officials. Now he's a political target.",
    "story": [
      "When Jeffrey Goldberg published a bombshell story outlining how some of the most senior US officials had mistakenly shared sensitive information with him, he obtained the biggest scoop of the year. The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.",
      "In the last couple of days, he's been called a \"loser\" and a \"sleazebag\" by President Donald Trump, as well as a liar and \"scum\" by US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, who appeared to have mistakenly added Goldberg to a group chat earlier this month.",
      "Before he became a political lightning rod, however, Goldberg watched on his phone as cabinet officials - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - discussed the sensitive details, timings and targets of an upcoming military operation in Yemen. They did not seem to notice his presence.",
      "In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he told me it all began when he got a message on his phone, via the publicly available Signal messaging app, which allows users to send each other encrypted messages. It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.",
      "\"I wish there was a Le Carr\u00e9 quality here, you know,\" he said, referring to the late British spy novelist. \"But he asked me to talk. I said yes. And next thing I know, I'm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States.\"",

      "Three sensitive messages analysed",
      "WATCH: How big a deal is this?",
      "As the fall-out of the episode has engulfed Washington, Waltz has taken responsibility for mistakenly adding Goldberg to the group chat, suggesting that he meant to invite somebody else.",
      "He has insisted that he has never met the editor, saying: \"I wouldn't know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup\".",
      "By Goldberg's account, the two have actually met several times, though he declined to go into detail about their relationship.",
      "\"He can say obviously whatever he wants, but I'm not commenting on my relationship or non-relationship,\" Goldberg told me. \"As a reporter, I'm just not comfortable talking publicly about relationships that I may or may not have with people who are news makers.\"",
      "Still, one thing is clear: you must already have someone's contact information to reach them on Signal, and so Waltz had Goldberg's phone number. The top security adviser has said he has asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and the White House's government efficiency czar, to investigate how the mistake happened - a move that was ridiculed by Goldberg.",
      "\"Really, you're going to put Elon Musk onto the question of how somebody's phone number ends up in someone's phone? I mean you know, most 8-year-olds could figure it out,\" he said.",
      "The bigger question? \"Should you, as national security officials, be doing this on Signal on your phone?\" Goldberg said.",
      "Six unanswered questions",
      "Six unanswered questions",
      "In his Monday Atlantic story - the first to report his access to the chat - Goldberg withheld the precise details that were shared around the bombing mission that attacked Houthi rebel targets in Yemen on 14 March. But Trump administration officials downplayed the report, calling him a liar and challenging his claims that classified information was shared.",
      "And so two days later, the magazine printed the full text messages, including several from Hegseth that included operational specifics. I asked him if that was a tough decision to make.",
      "\"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,\" he said. \"They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.\"",
      "There are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not \"war plans\" and none of it was classified information.",
      "President Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was \"doing a great job\" and describing Goldberg as a \"sleazebag\". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning.",
      "Goldberg did not appear swayed by their insults and claims.",
      "\"If Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, is texting me, telling me the attack was about to be launched on Yemen - telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, what kind of weapons are going to be used, and when the bombs are going to fall two hours after the text is received - that seems sensitive information, war-planning information to me,\" he said.",
      "This isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers\", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.",
      "I asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.",
      "\"This is their move. You never defend, just attack,\" Goldberg said. \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.\"",
      "Trump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press \"witch-hunt\". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.",
      "\"If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He said there is now some \"buzz\" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.",
      "Goldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit.",
      "But what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.",
      "\"There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, \" Goldberg said. \"Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.\"",

      "President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a \"t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate dinner\" after the interview.",
      "Macron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.",
      "The French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.",
      "Zelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month.",
      "After their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.",
      "It was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration.",
      "He switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.",
      "Zelensky hopes US will 'stand strong' in face of Russian demands",
      "Starmer announces 'coalition of the willing' to guarantee Ukraine peace",
      "But even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies.",
      "The evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all.",
      "Most European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States.",
      "American presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.",
      "Europe 'has discipline and no chaos'",
      "During the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence.",
      "He suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States.",
      "At best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.",
      "Europe, Zelensky said, \"has discipline and no chaos\". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.",

      "After Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire.",
      "The most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia.",
      "That decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium.",
      "The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".",
      "Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career.",
      "He told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"",

      "\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"",
      "Witkoff falling for Moscow's 'narratives'",
      "That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war.",
      "In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine.",
      "The American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States.",
      "What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.",
      "Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.",
      "\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"",
      "Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.",
      "\"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"",
      "In it for 'long haul'",
      "President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine.",
      "Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.",
      "I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.",
      "\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"",
      "Zelensky laughed.",
      "\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"",

      "The US has urged the authorities to free Machar, while the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries have all expressed their concern.",

      "The government is yet to comment on Machar's reported house-arrest.",
      "But addressing religious leaders on Wednesday, President Salva Kiir said \"he will never return the country to war\".",
      "Tensions have been building between Machar and the president for several weeks.",
      "The two leaders agreed in August 2018 to end the civil war between their forces that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.",
      "Earlier this week, the UN said that barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid had been used in airstrikes during fighting between the army and a rebel group previously linked to Machar.",
      "\"The arrest and detention of H.E Dr Riek Machar effectively brings the [peace] agreement to a collapse,\" SPLM/IO deputy leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino told journalists on Thursday.",
      "\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" he added.",
      "A similar warning was issued by the UN mission in the country, which said the country's leaders \"stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict\".",
      "Tension remains high in Juba with a heavy military presence reported around Machar's home.",
      "\"The public are in a panic,\" civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AFP news agency.",
      "\"There is a high chance of full-scale war but it will be more deadly and more violent because of [the need] for revenge,\" he added.",
      "But Pierino called on SPLM/IO members and the public to remain calm as diplomatic efforts continue to resolve the situation.",
      "Reath Muoch Tang, chairman of the party's foreign relations committee, said Machar was under house-arrest, but that security officials initially tried to take him away.",
      "\"An arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\" Tang said in a statement, calling the action a \"blatant violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement\".",

      "It could start as early as this year, and if found guilty Bolsonaro, 70, could face years in prison.",

      "\"It seems they have something personal against me,\" he added in a post on X, referring to the judges.",
      "Bolsonaro says he is the victim of \"political persecution\" aimed at preventing him from running again for president in 2026.",

      "Brazil's Attorney-General, Paulo Gonet, went even further in his report published last month, in which he accused Bolsonaro of not just being aware but of leading the criminal organisation that he says sought to overthrow Lula.",
      "According to Gonet's report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the Supreme Court justice who headed the panel which has now decided that the case should proceed to trial.",
      "Bolsonaro has always denied the allegations which he says are politically motivated and designed to stop him from running for president again.",
      "While he is already barred from running for public office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he had declared his intention to fight that ban so he could run for a second term in 2026.",
      "However, Wednesday's decision by the Supreme Court has placed a very high hurdle in his way to a possible candidacy."

      "Denmark has welcomed changes to a Greenland trip by US Vice-President JD Vance and his wife Usha, which has been reduced to a visit of just a US space base.",
      "Earlier this week, it was announced that Usha Vance would spend several days in Greenland, visiting the capital Nuuk and attending cultural events like a popular annual dogsled race.",
      "The White House said on Tuesday that JD Vance would join his wife in Greenland but that the couple would only spend a day there visiting the US Pituffik Space Base, on the north-western coast.",
      "US President Donald Trump has continued his threats of taking over Greenland, a Danish semi-autonomous territory, saying on Wednesday: \"We're going to have to have it\".",
      "\"We need Greenland for international safety and security,\" Trump added.",
      "Although JD Vance will become the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland,  a visit to a US base is less controversial than the original plan for his wife's visit, which Greenland's acting head of government Mute Egede called a \"provocation\".",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that the decision was \"very positive\" and that Denmark had \"nothing against\" the Americans visiting their own base.",
      "Rasmussen also said it was a \"masterful spin in many ways, to make [the US] look like they're escalating when they're actually deescalating.\"",
      "The revised programme will also likely reduce the risk of the Vances being met with protests by local residents.",
      "In recent weeks hundreds of people have taken part in demonstrations against the US, with some holding placards reading \"Respect international agreements\" and \"Yankee go home\".",
      "Earlier in March, Greenland's leading political parties issued a joint statement to condemn Trump's \"unacceptable behaviour\".",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister Mute B Egede wrote on Facebook that his country would \"never be the USA and we Greenlanders will never be Americans... Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.\"",
      "On Wednesday morning, Greenland media reported that several armoured cars which had arrived on the island in preparation for Usha Vance's visit were being loaded back on an American military plane.",
      "Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.",
      "It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest and a military presence there since World War Two.",
      "The Pituffik Space Base, located in the north-west of Greenland, supports missile warning, air defence and space surveillance missions.",
      "In a video posted on social media platform X on Tuesday, Vance said there was a lot of excitement around his wife's trip to Greenland. He is joining her because he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself\".",
      "He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as \"a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland\".",
      "He added that the Trump administration wanted to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland\", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for \"far too long\".",
      "It is unclear if Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz is still scheduled to visit. The BBC has reached out to the White House for confirmation.",
      "Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of Polar Research and Policy Initiative think tank, based in London, criticised the visit.",
      "He said it was \"highly unusual\" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.",
      "The US' interest in Greenland's security, given its strategic importance, makes sense, he said. But he added that it is \"inexplicable\" for Washington DC to have taken such an aggressive approach, especially in light of Trump's comments about acquiring the territory.",
      "\"Disrespecting the people of Greenland by saying the US will acquire it 'one way or the other' is unhelpful and counter-productive as a tactic,\" he added.",
      "According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.",

      "The French president meanwhile told a news conference: \"I hope there can be humanitarian decisions by the highest Algerian authorities to give him back his freedom and allow him to be treated for the disease he is fighting.\"",
      "Back in February, Macron sent a stark warning about the writer's plight, saying \"Boualem Sansal's arbitrary detention, on top of his worrying health situation, is one of the elements that need to be settled before confidence [between our countries] can be fully restored.\"",

      "A week later dozens of players, coaches and administrators were arrested for gambling, match-fixing and bribery as part of a two-year probe into corruption in the domestic game.",
      "And the defeats have continued. On Tuesday, Australia beat China 2-0 in Hangzhou - cementing them at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group.",
      "It wasn't long ago that China had dreamed of becoming a footballing superpower.",
      "The world's largest population, a thriving economy and a determined Communist Party led by an avid football fan, President Xi Jinping. What could go wrong?",
      "Apparently, quite a lot.",
      "Xi Jinping's three wishes",
      "When Xi came to power in 2012, his love for the sport spurred a drive to reform and improve Chinese football. His dream, he once said, was for China to qualify for the World Cup, host it and, ultimately, win it. These were his \"three wishes\".",
      "But a decade later, even Xi seemed to have lost the faith. While making small talk with Thailand's prime minister on the sidelines of an international summit in 2023, the Chinese president was heard saying that China had \"got lucky\" in a recent victory against Thailand.",
      "\"When China's government puts its mind to something, it very rarely fails,\" says Mark Dreyer, a Beijing-based sports writer. \"Look at electric vehicles, look at the Olympics. Practically any sector you can think of, China is right up there.\"",
      "But football, it seems, could not thrive in the grip of the Communist Party.",
      "A key government report in 2015 noted that The Chinese Football Association (CFA) must have \"legal autonomy,\" and should be \"independent\" of the General Administration of Sport (GAS).",
      "Even Xi admitted that if China wanted to succeed, then the Party would have to do what it seldom does: let go.",
      "And yet, Beijing didn't let go.",
      "The Steel Roses of Chinese football are outkicking men",
      "Farmers and students star in China's viral new football league",
      "\"China's failure in football has become a national embarrassment and figuring out the reasons has become a national obsession,\" Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts: One Man's Quest to Teach the People's Republic of China to Love Football, told the BBC.",
      "\"But to me, the reasons are pretty clear and they tell you a lot about how the country is run.\"",
      "The problem, he and others argue, is that China's one-party state imposes decisions from the top. While this is effective for economic growth, it yields poor results in competitive team sports.",
      "Although Fifa prohibits state interference, Chinese football is rife with political appointments. This is common in China, where the Party controls most aspects of public life.",
      "The current president of the CFA, Song Cai, is also a Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party. His work, in turn, is overseen by a senior government official at the GAS.",
      "\"Everything has to report upwards to Communist Party bosses. It basically means that non-football people are making football decisions,\" Mr Dreyer says. \"Football has to be grassroots-led. You start at the bottom of the pyramid and the talent starts to funnel up to the top.\"",
      "All major footballing nations have a \"pyramid\" of leagues. The elite professional clubs sit at the top, supported by a deep pool of semi-professional and amateur teams, all of whose players are vying to work their way up.",
      "Such a pyramid thrives on a culture of playing football, en masse, for fun. The larger the pool to draw from, the better the players at the top will be.",
      "\"If you look at every country where football is really successful, the sport has grown organically as a grassroots activity over the past 100 years,\" Mr Simons says. \"Professional football in China has continually failed because it's supported by nothing - their pyramid is upside down.\"",
      "The statistics bear this out: England's 1.3 million registered players dwarf China's fewer-than-100,000 footballers. This is in spite of China's population being 20 times larger than England's.",
      "\"Kids here don't grow up with a ball at their feet. Without that, you're not going to produce elite talent,\" Mr Dreyer says.",
      "Top-level football in Europe and South America traces its origins to streets and parks in every town and village. In China, however, the push began in Beijing.",
      "It wasn't until the 1990s that the government set up the country's first professional league. It created a handful of top clubs in major cities - but neglected the grassroots.",
      "Keen to impress their bosses, officials in this top-down system inevitably opt for a \"short-termist\" approach that sacrifices genuine improvement over time for quick fixes, Mr Dreyer explains.",
      "Some foreigners who have played in China say such a heavily controlled system also leaves little room for young players to develop a natural understanding of the game.",
      "A European currently playing in China, who did not wish to reveal his name, told the BBC that while many Chinese players are \"technically good\", they lack \"football IQ\" at crucial moments on the pitch.",

      "Many in China have referred to them as the \"real\" guozu or national team - and in 2023, a record 53 million people tuned in to watch them play - and lose 6-1 - to England at the World Cup.",
      "The men's Super League boasts the highest average attendance of any league in Asia. At its peak in the 2010s, it was attracting big-name foreign players as it rode a wave of investment from state-owned enterprises, buoyed by a thriving economy.",
      "But it was short-lived.",
      "Since the pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown in China, more than 40 professional clubs have folded as state-backed companies started to pull their investments. Private companies, too, have proved fickle in their commitment.",
      "In 2015, the Suning Appliance Group, which also used to own the top Italian club Inter Milan, bought Jiangsu FC. The club went on to win the Super League in 2020. But months later, Suning said they were closing the club to focus on their retail business.",
      "The demise of Guangzhou Evergrande, China's most successful team ever, is yet another example.",
      "Bankrolled by property giant Evergrande Group, they won trophy after trophy under the management of Italian greats such as Marcello Lippi and Fabio Cannavaro. But as they found glory at home and in Asia, their parent company was overstretching itself in an inflated property market.",
      "Evergrande is now the world's most indebted property company and the poster-child for China's real estate crisis, with arrears of more than $300bn (\u00a3225bn).",
      "Its former club - now in the hands of new owners - was expelled from the league in January. After years of splurging, the eight-time champions are still struggling to pay off their debt.",
      "But that is not the only crisis engulfing Chinese football. Its rapid rise created another problem: corruption.",
      "\"I should have followed the right path. I was just doing what was customary at the time,\" says Li Tie, the former manager of China's national men's team, in a 2024 documentary.",
      "In that documentary, Li makes a shocking admission: for years he fixed matches and paid bribes to get certain jobs, including 3m yuan (\u00a3331,000, $418,500) to become the national team coach in 2019.",
      "Dressed in all-black, he marks a written confession with an inky fingerprint: \"I'm very sorry.\"",
      "China's national team was made to watch the documentary by state broadcaster CCTV while preparing for last year's Asian Cup in Qatar.",
      "The primetime expose, co-produced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), was the first episode of a four-part series on corruption in China called Continued Efforts, Deepening Progress.",
      "In it, dozens of Chinese officials confess - always to camera - to staggering levels of corruption across a variety of industries.",
      "By airing the football episode first, the authorities signalled their serious concern about graft within the sport.",
      "Li, who appeared in a World Cup and once played for Premier League side Everton, is the most high-profile figure to have been apprehended last year in an unprecedented slew of anti-corruption arrests in Chinese football.",
      "In December, he was sentenced to 20 years in jail.",
      "Also publicly shamed in the documentary are former CFA chairman Chen Xuyuan and ex-deputy director of the GAS, Du Zhaocai.",
      "\"The corruption of these officials has broken our hearts,\" one fan told CCTV. \"I'm not surprised,\" said another.",
      "The documentary echoed what one ex-national team player told a BBC radio documentary in 2015 in an anonymous interview: that there was a system of \"open bidding\" among players for their spot in the squad.",
      "\"I could have won many more caps, but I didn't have the cash,\" he said.",
      "It would take another 10 years before corruption in football exploded into the spotlight. Some suggest this was prompted by China's intolerably bad performances on the pitch.",
      "The struggles of China's men's football team are all the more stark given how other sports are flourishing in the country.",

    "summary": "The two legal teams have clashed repeatedly in court as the French film star's lawyer has questioned the credibility of the two plaintiffs.",
    "story": [
      "By his own recognition, G\u00e9rard Depardieu acts in a world that is no longer his own.",
      "On day three of his sexual assault trial in Paris, the French cinema star admitted that he was given to \"rude\" and \"vulgar\" language no longer regarded as acceptable.",
      "It got to the point a few years ago, he said, where he insisted no female assistants should come near him in his dressing-room, because they were too liable to be shocked.",
      "\"Knowing the vulgarity of the old world, today I try to avoid being listened to by the new world \u2013 so that I don't come across as detestable,\" he told the court.",
      "\"I am not very much at ease with this new society... I think my time is done.\"",
      "But he denies being a sexual abuser.",
      "\"I don't see how it could be fun feeling up a woman, her buttocks, her breasts. I am not a metro-train groper,\" he said.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of sexual assault on two women on a film-set in 2021.  Both say he touched them on intimate parts of the body.",
      "In court the actor repeated his defence: that he may have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance, but that there was never any sexual intent.",
      "If convicted, Depardieu could face five years in jail and a fine of up to \u20ac75,000 (\u00a363,000; $81,000). The trial should continue until Thursday at least.",
      "Since Monday the packed courtroom has been the scene of explosive exchanges between the two legal teams \u2013 with Depardieu's lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous conducting an aggressive defence aimed at undermining the credibility of the two plaintiffs.",
      "But on Wednesday it was Depardieu who was subject to intense questioning, and at one point appeared to imply that a hand on a buttock did not constitute sexual assault.",
      "\"I never carried out an act of sexual assault [against a plaintiff]. Anyway sexual assault in my view is worse than what she has said,\" he said under questioning from the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt.",
      "Smelling blood, the lawyer swooped: \"You're saying that sexual assault has to be more than a hand on the buttocks?\"",
      "Out of his seat shot Depardieu's lawyer.",
      "\"No, that is not what my client said,\" he said, accusing Ms Durrieu-Diebolt of \"trying to create quotes that can be tweeted by the media.\"",
      "There is evidently no love lost between the two sides.",
      "Mr Assous is seen by the plaintiffs' team as deliberately setting out to bait them. He in turn believes that feminist \"activists\" have been at work on the plaintiffs, encouraging them to file charges that they might not otherwise have brought.",
      "The events under discussion took place in Paris in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an aging actor coming to terms with his declining powers.",
      "It is the first time the actor has appeared in court on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and he has also been accused of rape, all of which he has denied.",
      "The first plaintiff \u2013 a set decorator \u2013 told the court on Tuesday that after a minor argument with Depardieu he caught her between his legs, held her by the hips and told her obscenities.",
      "The second plaintiff \u2013 an assistant director \u2013 said she had been assaulted by the actor on three occasions. On the first, she had been accompanying him from his dressing-room to the set when she felt his hand on her buttock.",
      "Another time he touched her breasts through her clothes, and a third time the buttocks again. After she told her superior what had happened, Depardieu allegedly called her a \"snitch\" and refused to have her come near him.",
      "For the defense,  Mr Assous produced photographs taken at the end of the shoot showing Depardieu and the plaintiff apparently smiling happily together. She said she had wanted to play the incidents down, and that she was not even sure at the time if they had constituted a penal offence.",
      "It was only two years later when she had seen media coverage of Depardieu's alleged sexual misconduct in other cases that she had decided to lodge a complaint with police, she said.",
      "She added the affair had left her in a state of anxious distress, and still today she was having difficulty sleeping.",
      "The trial has offered a rare chance for the French public to see the once-revered actor - star of films like Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac - at close quarters.",
      "He appeared in court dressed in black shirt and jacket, and leaning on the shoulder of his very large bodyguard.",
      "The bodyguard \u2013 named as Massika - was referenced regularly in proceedings.",
      "Depardieu said Massika's permanent presence made it impossible for him to have carried out the sexual attacks of which he is accused.",
      "The actor is himself very overweight, and told the court he had difficulty walking more than a short distance.",
      "\"My joints all hurt. Basically my body is bust,\" he said.",
      "In the courtroom he sits on a special box that Massika brought with him.",
      "It is white, and covered in kiss-marks and signatures from people who have given Depardieu support.",

    "story": [
      "The head of Turkey's main opposition party has told the BBC that protests will continue \"in every city\" until either early presidential elections are called, or the jailed mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, is released from prison.",
      "Ozgur Ozel, chairman of the mayor's Republican People's Party (CHP), said the nationwide protests would include a very large demonstration this Saturday in Istanbul. That will open the party's campaign to make Imamoglu the country's next president in elections that are due in 2028, he said.",
      "\"In every city we go to, we will have the biggest rallies in their history,\" Ozel declared.",
      "\"The belief in Ekrem Imamoglu and in democracy will make the protests bigger and stronger,\" he told us at his party headquarters in Istanbul, as visitors, staff and advisors bustled in and out.",
      "The opposition has brought huge crowds onto the streets - the biggest seen here in over a decade - since Imamoglu was arrested seven days ago.",
      "Alongside the mass demonstrations, there have also been mass arrests - more than 1,400 people and counting, including seven Turkish journalists who were reporting on the protests.",
      "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has plenty of strong supporters, has condemned the demonstrations as \"street terrorism\" and accused protesters of attacking the police and damaging public property.",
      "He said the opposition's \"show\" would eventually fade.",
      "Ozel spoke to the BBC fresh from a visit to Silivri Prison, a high-security campus on the outskirts of Istanbul where Imamoglu is being held.",
      "\"He is in solitary confinement, but he's in good condition and has not been mistreated so far,\" he told us.",
      "Ozel said the corruption case against Istanbul's mayor was \"a scam designed to discredit him\".",
      "As an example, he cited allegations that Imamoglu bought land cheaply years ago, and the low purchase price may have been a bribe. \"The truth was that small payment was just the deposit for the land,\" he said.",

      "Protests are about far more than fate of Istanbul's mayor",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - Turkey's presidential hopeful who is under arrest",
      "Imamoglu denies all the charges against him, including \"establishing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, and rigging a public tender\".",
      "He says his arrest was a coup. Turkish officials say the courts here are independent. Human rights organisations strongly dispute that.",
      "Ozel said Imamoglu was arrested for one simple reason \u2013 to prevent him becoming Turkey's next president. Opinion polls suggest the mayor might be able to do that \u2013 if he's not behind bars.",
      "\"Erdogan has thrown a three-time election winner in jail\u2026 in front of the whole world,\" Ozel said.",
      "\"Suddenly he is jailing someone who is fighting against him in a normal political way. It's like your rival coming and slicing the ball in a football game, because you are winning.\"",
      "The opposition party believes the response of Turkish society and the international community will be key in deciding if Imamoglu remains behind bars.",
      "But Ozel said the CHP felt \"abandoned\" by the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his party.",
      "\"While all of Europe is reacting, the English Labour Party, and Starmer have said nothing. The cradle of democracy - England - and our brother party, the Labour party, how can they stay silent? We are really hurt.\"",
      "A few hours before that comment on Tuesday, Starmer's spokesman said that there was \"an ongoing domestic Turkish legal process\" and the UK \"expects Turkey to uphold the rule of law\".",
      "If the mayor is not released, the CHP plans to keep fighting for the presidency.",
      "\"If they keep Ekrem Imamoglu locked up and hinder his candidacy,\" Ozel said, \"any member of CHP can be a candidate and would be elected with 65% to 70%\"."

    "story": [
      "South Korean governments committed numerous human rights violations over decades in a controversial programme that sent at least 170,000 children and babies abroad for adoption, a landmark inquiry has found.",
      "It said the government's lack of oversight enabled the \"mass exportation of children\" by private agencies that were driven by profit, and found examples of fraud, falsified records and coercion.",
      "Since the 1950s, South Korea has sent more children abroad for adoption than any other country, with most sent to Western countries.",
      "South Korea has sinced moved to tighten its adoption processes, but some adoptees and their biological parents say they are still haunted by what they went through. The BBC spoke to one woman who claimed her adoptive parents \"took better care of the dog than they ever did of me\".",
      "\"This is a shameful part of our history,\" said Park Sun-young, the chairperson of the commission, at a press briefing.",
      "\"While many adoptees were fortunate to grow up in loving families, others suffered great hardship and trauma due to flawed adoption processes. Even today, many continue to face challenges.\"",
      "The report was released on Wednesday by the independent Truth and Reconciliation Commission following an investigation that began in 2022.",
      "Since then, 367 adoptees - all of which were sent overseas between 1964 and 1999 - had filed petitions alleging fradulent practices in their adoption process.",
      "Some 100 petitions have been analysed so far, of whom 56 adoptees were recognised as victims of human rights violations. The commission is still investigating other cases, with the inquiry set to end in May.",
      "In the aftermath of the Korean war, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world and few families were keen on adopting children.",
      "South Korea's government then began a transnational adoption programme handled by private agencies, which were given significant powers through special adoption laws.",
      "But there was a \"systemic failure in oversight and management\", which led to numerous lapses committed by these agencies, according to the report.",
      "The report noted that foreign agencies had demanded a set number of children every month and Korean agencies complied, \"facilitating large-scale intercountry adoptions with minimal procedural oversight\".",
      "With no government regulation on fees, the Korean agencies charged large amounts and demanded \"donations\", which turned adoptions into \"a profit-driven industry\", according to the report.",
      "Other lapses include adoptions conducted without proper consent from birth mothers and inadequate screening of adoptive parents.",
      "The agencies also fabricated reports that made children appear as if they were abandoned and put up for adoption; and intentionally gave children wrong identities.",
      "Because many adoptees had false identities listed in their paperwork, they now struggle to obtain information about their birth families and are left with inadequate legal protection, the report noted.",
      "The commission has recommended the government deliver an official apology, and to comply with international standards on transnational adoptions.",
      "'I have had a painful and miserable life'",
      "South Korea has moved to tighten its adoption processes in recent years. In 2023, it passed a law ensuring that all overseas adoptions would be handled by a government ministry instead of private agencies, which is due to come into effect by July.",
      "The South Korean government has yet to respond to Wednesday's report.",
      "Inger-Tone Ueland Shin, 60, was one of the petitioners whose cases were investigated by the commission. She was adopted by a Norwegian couple when she was 13 - and discovered later on that her adoption was illegal.",
      "The couple, who were in their 50s at the time, had initially applied to adopt but were rejected by Norwegian authorities as they were too old.",
      "They then travelled to South Korea and visited an orphanage, where they selected Inger-Tone and took her with them to Norway.",
      "The couple only submitted an adoption application to Norwegian authorities years later. The authorities approved it, despite acknowledging the illegality of Inger-Tone's situation, because they determined that by then she had \"no connection to Korea anymore\".",
      "Inger-Tone told the BBC she had great difficulty adjusting to life in Norway, and also alleged her adoptive father sexually abused her.",
      "\"They took better care of the dog than they ever did of me,\" she said. \"It was so painful. I wasn't able to talk or express myself, other than crying at night\".",

      "\"They have never spent time in prison for what they've done to me. They criminally picked up a child outside of the country... nobody has taken responsibility for what they did to me,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Strong winds, dense forest and unusually dry weather - that's the deadly combination that experts say is fuelling the largest wildfires in South Korea's history.",
      "The inferno in the south-east has burned through 35,810 hectares (88,500 acres) as of Thursday - that's about half the size of New York City - killing 27 people so far and displacing tens of thousands.",
      "Authorities believe the wildfires started by accident from human activity, but the main drivers of the devastation are dry land, and strong gusts sweeping over inland regions.",
      "The high concentration of pine forest in North Gyeongsang province, where the fires are burning, is also \"oiling\" the blaze, said a forest disaster expert.",
      "Vulnerable pine forests",
      "\"Pine trees contain resin, which acts like oil, intensifying fires when ignited. This resin causes wildfires to burn faster, stronger, and longer,\" said Lee Byung-doo from the National Institute of Forest Science in Seoul.",
      "Andong, one of the worst-hit cities, is known for its tranquil pine forests.",
      "While they provide shelter and food for local wildlife and sometimes help break the wind, pine trees \"become problematic during wildfires\", Mr Lee told the BBC.",
      "\"Because forests [in South Korea] contain large numbers of pine trees, the areas are particularly vulnerable when fires break out,\" he said.",
      "Furthermore, pine trees retain their needles throughout winter, making them susceptible to \"crown fires\" - wildfires that spread by igniting the dense canopy of branches and leaves. This has contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of the flames over the past week.",
      "Unlike neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea, South Korea has made gains in forest cover over recent years.",
      "\"Most mountains are now filled with fallen leaves and pine trees... This accumulation has become a significant factor in accelerating the spread of wildfire,\" says Baek Min-ho, a disaster prevention specialist at Kangwon National University.",

      "The ideal environment for these record blazes has been building for the past few weeks, which saw temperatures rise above 20C (68F), unusually high for spring. Analysis by Climate Central, which researches climate science, suggests that these high temperatures have been made up to five times more likely by global warming.",
      "The unusual heat dried out the land and air, allowing fires to spread more rapidly, especially when combined with strong winds.",
      "Dense tree cover and strong winds in the fire-hit region also pose substantial challenges to firefighting efforts.",
      "On Wednesday, a 73-year-old pilot died when his firefighting helicopter crashed in Uiseong county. At least three other firefighters have been killed in the blazes.",
      "Elderly residents in second-oldest province",
      "Most of the 26 people who died are in their 60s and 70s, officials say. South Korea is an ageing society, where one in five people are at least 65 years old.",
      "North Gyeongsang is its second-oldest province, which also explains the relatively high death toll - it is especially difficult to evacuate older people in a disaster because they may have mobility issues or other health risks.",
      "They may also have more difficulty accessing or interpreting evacuation orders.",
      "Three residents of an elderly care facility in Yeongdeok county died on Wednesday, when the car they were in went up in flames. Only one out of four in the vehicle managed to flee in time, the Korea JoongAng Daily reported.",

      "China's efforts to build up huge business interests across Africa have been accompanied by a careful policy of maintaining neutrality - but the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has caused a shift in its approach.",
      "Rwanda has been widely accused of stoking the fighting in the mineral-rich region and Beijing, which has close relations with both DR Congo and Rwanda, has in recent weeks joined the criticism.",
      "But it is trying to walk a diplomatic tightrope to maintain good relations with both countries, while also continuing to operate its businesses - and buy crucial minerals.",
      "How is China's response to this conflict different?",
      "For decades, China has been careful not to take sides in conflicts in Africa, to avoid causing problems that might interfere with its extensive commercial interests.",
      "Up to now it has shied away from criticising African governments for supporting participants in a conflict.",
      "For example, China has said little about the series of coups since 2020 in West Africa's Sahel region, except to urge leaders to consider the interests of the people.",
      "Beijing has long pursued a policy of non-interference in another state's internal affairs, says Prof Zhou Yuyuan, who specialises in African development and security at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS).",
      "It therefore avoids proposing solutions to conflicts, apart from calling for diplomatic or political efforts by international organisations such as the UN or the African Union.",
      "The unrest involving Rwandan-back M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo reared its head again in 2021. The fighters are led by ethnic Tutsis who say they took up arms to protect the rights of the minority group - and because the Congolese authorities reneged on an earlier peace deal.",
      "In its early comments on these developments, China restricted itself to criticising unnamed \"foreign forces\" for providing support to the M23 fighters.",
      "But in the last few weeks it has broken from its usual practice and referred to Rwanda by name.",
      "This follows major gains by the M23, which since January has captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu.",
      "\"China reiterates its hope that Rwanda will\u2026 stop its military support for M23 and immediately withdraw all its military forces from the DRC territory,\" China's UN ambassador said in February.",

      "\"China 'hoped' that Rwanda would stop its support but did not condemn it,\" he says.",
      "However, soon afterwards China backed a UN Security Council resolution which bluntly calls on the Rwanda Defence Forces to \"cease support to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions\".",
      "Why has China made this shift?",
      "According to Prof Zhou, China's statements are likely to have been prompted by UN expert reports, which have provided strong evidence of Rwanda's support for the M23.",
      "\"This is a basic consensus in the UN Security Council,\" he added.",
      "\"The problem has been going on long enough, and everyone knows in their hearts the basic situation. There's no need to be hush-hush any more.\"",

      "How these mines have been affected by the fighting is so far unclear.",
      "The M23 has also seized territory containing mines for coltan ore, which China imports in large volumes.",
      "The metal tantalum, used in cars and everyday electronics from TV sets to mobile phones, is extracted from this ore, and DR Congo is the source of 40% of the world's supply.",

      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "A UN expert group said in December 2024 that the M23 had smuggled coltan to Rwanda from DR Congo. It also noted that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023.",
      "Although Rwanda has its own coltan mines, analysts say they could not account for such a large increase in production.",
      "It is not yet clear whether the volume or the price of coltan imported by China has been affected.",
      "Another mineral that China imports from DR Congo is cobalt, which is crucial for the lithium battery industry.",
      "However, China's cobalt mining operations are primarily based in southern DR Congo, away from the conflict zones in the east.",
      "Dozens of Chinese companies, many of which are state-owned, are also building roads, telecommunications and hydropower facilities in DR Congo. But it seems that the impact on these activities has so far been minimal.",
      "Does China provide military support to Rwanda or DR Congo?",
      "China's supplies weapons to both Rwanda and DR Congo.",
      "In the past two decades, the Rwandan military has bought Chinese armoured vehicles, artillery and anti-tank missiles, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).",

      "It is reported that the drones, at least, have been used in the fight against the M23.",
      "Have China's relations with either country been affected?",

    "story": [
      "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?",
      "It's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.",
      "After a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.",
      "Analysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.",
      "Over the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments.",
      "Banking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.",
      "Data from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments.",
      "So why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?",
      "Weak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.",
      "But beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.",
      "Slowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.",
      "Investments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.",
      "India's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.",
      "With all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.",
      "According to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.",
      "Key to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.",
      "The government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.",
      "But none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.",
      "According to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.",
      "India's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.",
      "\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.",
      "Rathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.",
      "\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.",
      "He said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.",
      "\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.",
      "But things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.",
      "Interest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.",
      "India's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen.",

      "The messages, however, need some unpicking. Here are three of them with some analysis.",
      "Timetable for the attack",
      "These messages provide details of the US military's plan for the Yemen strikes - described as a \"package\", a military term which refers to a set of aircraft, weapons systems and intelligence gathering devices that will participate in an operation.",
      "\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the BBC.",
      "He added that it may have been declassified afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time it was shared.",
      "The messages from Hegseth note what time F-18 fighter aircraft are scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes will take place and in what timeframe \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur.",
      "In this context, \"trigger\" refers to a set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before weapons are deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up.",
      "This information is considered highly sensitive.",
      "Philip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer with the British Army, told the BBC that similar information \"falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret\".",
      "\"You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from,\" he added.",
      "In the wake of the chat's revelations, the White House and other US officials have argued that this information does not constitute a \"war plan\".",
      "In a post on X, Hegseth said: \"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods.\"",
      "A 'missile guy' hit at girlfriend's home",
      "In this part of the group chat, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz provides an update on the strike - which in military parlance is called a battle damage assessment, or BDA.",
      "Waltz notes that the target building has collapsed, and that the US military had earlier had positive identification of the target - a Houthi \"missile guy\" - walking into the building, which was believed to be his girlfriend's residence.",
      "In his message, Waltz congratulates Pete - referring to Hegseth, as well as the IC, shorthand for \"intelligence community\" and Kurilla, a reference to Michael Kurilla, a US Army General who oversees Central Command, a regional combatant command with responsibility over the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia.",
      "The messages do not reveal how the target's whereabouts or movements were tracked.",
      "A military expert contacted by the BBC - but who wished to remain nameless - suggested that a combination of aerial platforms, technological tracking capabilities or human intelligence on the ground could have been used, or a combination of various sources.",
      "At least 53 people were killed in the initial wave of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which struck more than 30 targets  including training facilities, drone infrastructure, as well as weapons manufacturing and storage sites and command and control centres, including one in which the Pentagon said several unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located.",
      "It is unclear which of the targets Waltz was referring to in the group chat.",
      "CIA activities in Yemen",
      "Another potentially sensitive message comes from Joe Kent, a former special operations soldier and failed congressional candidate who was nominated by Trump to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center.",
      "In his message, Kent refers to Israel carrying out their own strikes.",
      "The Israeli military has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since the beginning of the war in Gaza, in retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets conducted in support of Hamas.",
      "The most recent attacks took place on 19 and 26 December of last year.",
      "According to Kent, the Israeli government would seek to \"replenish\" any weapons stocks used in further raids, although he believes that to be a \"minor factor\".",
      "A slightly more sensitive message follows from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who notes that the US is  \"mobilising assets\" to help a strike, but that a delay would \"not negatively impact\" the agency's work in Yemen.",
      "\"Additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership,\" he wrote.",
      "Assets, in this context, could refer to CIA-run spies on the ground in Yemen, or technological means such as surveillance drone flights.",
      "Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and ex-CIA paramilitary officer, said that Ratcliffe's message was very sensitive.",
      "\"Essentially, we don't want to share where the CIA is focused,\" he added.",
      "Ratcliffe told a House hearing on Wednesday that he did not transmit classified information.",

    "story": [
      "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?",
      "At 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.",
      "Exhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.",
      "The United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.",
      "Almost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.",
      "\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"",
      "It was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.",
      "There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.",
      "It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had.",
      "The United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image.",
      "The baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.",
      "Yet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.",
      "Donald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.",
      "The question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?",
      "A challenge to the Truman legacy",
      "President Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.",
      "\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?",
      "\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"",
      "It's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration.",
      "And the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.",
      "In the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"",
      "Another account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",
      "Trump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia.",
      "Many saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.",
      "On the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share.",
      "To some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".",
      "The United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for.",
      "Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end.",
      "\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"",
      "\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"",
      "Nato Article 5 'is on life support'",
      "The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.",
      "\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.",
      "For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all.",
      "In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.",
      "Others are less sure.",
      "Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support.",
      "\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.",
      "\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"",
      "According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.",
      "\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.",
      "\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".",
      "And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"",
      "Has a 'fragmentation of the West' begun?",
      "All of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"",
      "In early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".",
      "\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.",
      "\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"",
      "'We forgot the lessons of our history'",
      "One of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed.",
      "Britain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)",
      "\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.",
      "\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"",
      "The prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?",
      "\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"",
      "Then there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.",
      "\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"",
      "But Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.",
      "Others share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.",
      "\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"",
      "Mr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"",
      "Piecing together a new world order",
      "There is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash.",
      "\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.",
      "\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"",
      "The question is how to achieve this.",
      "Ms van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.",
      "\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"",
      "The European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"",
      "In the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.",
      "What he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.",
      "We don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.",

    "story": [
      "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
      "Now, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.",
      "In a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\".",
      "The findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.",
      "Mr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".",
      "\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\".",
      "\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"",
      "Feminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\".",
      "Chakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death.",
      "Perhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".",
      "Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.",
      "Chakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death.",
      "\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief.",
      "But within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues.",
      "The Rajput family has not commented on the latest developments regarding his death.",

      "However, the tragedy - which came in the midst of a lockdown while India was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic - became the biggest prime-time story for a nation glued to their television sets.",
      "And Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.",
      "Some of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\".",
      "A video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt.",
      "The vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.",
      "She was released a month later and has since tried her hand at motivational speaking and has now reinvented herself as a businesswoman who has launched a clothing line and her own podcast with celebrity interviews. She is also doing a reality TV show.",
      "Chakraborty has also spoken about her ordeal, including how the name-calling and character assassination cost her work and how her family were also hounded.",

      "It is not clear what action she is contemplating against those who vilified her, but many are now suggesting on social media that she sue them for damages.",
      "While neither the actress or her lawyer have not yet said what they intend to do, columnist Namita Bhandare points out that seeking compensation in India, with its overburdened judiciary and millions of pending court cases, is anything but easy.",
      "\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"",

      "What happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\".",

      "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.",

      "Raybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and is also used to destroy targets both on the front line and deep inside Russia.",
      "Among their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.",
      "But after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.",
      "As well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.",

      "Ukraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.",
      "Kyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.",
      "Zelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.",
      "The energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.",
      "Last month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.",
      "And lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.",
      "Moscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.",
      "At the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.",
      "And if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.",
      "Back at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field.",
      "Oleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beneath the acrid smell of tear gas on the night air in Istanbul, there is a hint of something else - a whiff of panic on the part of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "One of his rivals has been put behind bars - so far, so familiar.",
      "But the jailing of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, suggests President Erdogan is rattled \u2013 and he may have gone too far. The mayor's opposition Republican People's party (CHP), which is summoning vast crowds onto the streets, is certainly hoping so.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - always smartly turned out, even as he prepared to be detained - is the main rival to Turkey's increasingly authoritarian leader. He could well replace him in presidential elections due to be held by 2028 - assuming he is free to contest them.",
      "But this is far more than a row about the fate of Istanbul's mayor - charismatic though he may be.",
      "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era. Many see this as a chance to call halt and stop the descent into all-out autocracy - if it's not already too late.",
      "And they are coming out each night braving the riot police and their tear gas and rubber bullets, the ban on demonstrations, the road and bridge closures, and the risk of detention.",
      "Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu?",
      "Why are thousands of people protesting in Turkey?",
      "More than 1,000 people have been detained so far - in just 5 days - and counting. That's an indication of how easy it is to be arrested here.",
      "Turkey claims to be a functioning democracy - and at face value, it is. There are elections. Voter turnout is usually high - Turks cherish their right to go to the polls and cast their ballots. Voting is largely fair, on the day itself.",
      "The problem is what happens away from the polling stations.",
      "Opposition politicians can be jailed. Critics intimidated. Protesters arrested. The media is largely government controlled. A tweet ridiculing the president could land you in a cell. By the time polling day comes around there's a tsunami of pro-government coverage and the opposition struggles to get a look in.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu is the type of politician who can cut through all this and reach the voters. He's media savvy and has been elected mayor of Istanbul three times. Now he's accused of embezzlement, taking bribes and running a criminal organisation.",
      "If convicted he could be barred from standing in the presidential race. He's already appealing a previous conviction and sentence of two years in prison, for insulting election officials.",
      "Turkey insists that its courts are independent and simply follow the law. Human rights activists here, and independent analysts, scoff at that idea.",
      "The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, said the detention of the mayor, along with about 100 other municipal officials and politicians, is a \"politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities\". In the past it has criticised \"politicised decisions by courts\" in Turkey.",
      "In a post on X, where he has 9.6m followers, Imamoglu said the case against him was \"a black stain on our democracy\", adding: \"I stand tall. I will never bow.\"",
      "That's what Erdogan, 71, may be afraid of - an opponent who is younger, at 53, also appeals to conservative Turkish voters, and is ready for a long fight.",
      "So, what happens now?",
      "The protests could gain momentum and keep spreading. That will present a serious challenge to Erdogan. How long before his heavily armed security forces crack down even harder? How long before someone loses their life at a protest? There is a breaking point for every strongman regime, and it can come with a single bullet.",
      "The opposition intends to keep up the pressure, and the demonstrations.",
      "But after his two decades at the top, Erdogan still has plenty of loyal supporters. He controls virtually all the levers of power and seems determined to hang on. He will be banking on the demonstrations petering out, over time.",
      "The president and his ruling AK party will be hoping the protesters will grow weary and go back to worrying about crushing inflation (39% in February), and the dwindling value of the Turkish lira, rather than free speech, and democracy.",

    "summary": "Alice Guo's star was on the rise in the Philippines - until alleged links to a scam operation led to her downfall.",
    "story": [
      "In early 2022, residents of the rural Philippine town of Bamban, north of Manila, gathered for the mayoral campaign rally of a plucky young woman named Alice Leal Guo.",
      "Supporters dressed in pink \u2013 their candidate's favourite colour \u2013 chattered in anticipation of her arrival.",
      "Then came the low thudding of a helicopter rotor, prompting cheers from the crowd. Sitting in the cockpit, Guo \u2013 in a pink shirt and a pilot's headset \u2013 flashed a smile, waving down at her supporters.",
      "As the helicopter touched down, the crowd broke into a chant: \"A-lice Guo! A-lice Guo!\"",
      "At 31, Guo's star was rising: with promises of generous subsidies and economic development, all delivered in her signature brassy, upbeat tone, she had galvanised a following in the town which would see her become its first female mayor.",
      "But few of those cheering could have predicted that less than three years later, Guo would be behind bars, facing charges of human trafficking and allegations that she was a Chinese spy.",
      "Her downfall began with a police raid that uncovered a compound where a giant scam operation was being run from just behind her office. But as the authorities delved deeper, and Guo struggled to answer basic queries about her past, a perplexing question emerged: who really is Alice Guo?",
      "The mayor everyone seemed to love",
      "Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.",
      "The career change would have required deep pockets \u2013 and when quizzed about her campaign finances much later, Guo said it was friends and acquaintances in the pig-farming business who had supported her mayoral bid.",
      "But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople. Little is known about them, but some have subsequently been convicted of money-laundering, and now also face charges of human trafficking alongside Guo.",
      "Her campaign focused on her sunny persona. On stage at one event, Guo told her audience: \"For our team, rule number one is: Do no harm! No harm is allowed, we should just spread love, love, love!\"",
      "Such cheerful platitudes would carry a taint of irony, in retrospect, when authorities exposed the harm and suffering they alleged had been inflicted under Guo's watch.",
      "But upon taking office in June 2022, she brought the youthful, bright-eyed energy of her campaign into Bamban Municipal Hall, painting it pink and decorating the outside of the building with flowers.",
      "\"Alice was beautiful, she was kind and she was helpful to other women,\" said Priscilla May Aban, 31, who runs a vegetable stall in the town. She told the BBC that she had voted for Guo precisely because she was a woman, adding that as mayor, Guo had arranged cleaning jobs for women of the town.",
      "Guo was widely regarded as a caring and empathetic leader, judging by conversations the BBC had with several residents of Bamban. Miah Mejia, the daughter of one of Alice's political allies, claimed that she had given a free scholarship to every local household. Another interviewee told us he hadn't received a college scholarship but had been given a cash subsidy for his school fees.",
      "An emotional Francisco Flores, 75, said, \"She's helped a lot of poor people here in Bamban, giving medicines and the way she is with people, you'd never see a problem.\"",
      "He proudly mentioned the arrival of a McDonald's and a branch of the Philippine fast-food chain Jollibee during Guo's tenure.",
      "Online, pro-Guo social media accounts portrayed her as a progressive young mayor presiding over a pink-tinted wonderland of parades, buffalo races and concerts.",
      "A year-and-half into her mayoralty, however, this carefully crafted image began to crumble.",
      "Inside Bamban's underbelly",
      "In February 2024, Philippine police received a report about a Vietnamese national who had escaped from the captivity of Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated, a company operating out of a walled compound in Bamban.",
      "On the evening of 12 March, police officers and soldiers gathered nearby to plan a raid on the site, located just a minute's walk from Guo's office in the Municipal Hall.",
      "One officer who was there, Marvin de la Paz of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), told the BBC that around midnight, police informants sent word that people were leaving the compound in buses.",
      "Suspecting that their plans for a raid had been leaked, Mr de la Paz and his colleagues raced straight for the compound. On the way, they saw people fleeing in the other direction, and some officers in the convoy had to peel off and chase them down. When they arrived at the site, they found one of the largest scam hubs ever uncovered in the Philippines, containing 36 buildings and spanning almost 20 acres.",
      "\"We were amazed,\" Mr de la Paz said, \"That was our first time seeing such a grandiose entrance [to a scam compound]... Somehow you feel like you're small in this compound.\"",
      "It later emerged that the compound was built on land which Guo had previously owned \u2013 and that, as mayor, she had granted Zun Yuan a business permit. Her name also appeared on an electricity bill found at the site.",
      "Alice Guo's lawyers did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "Zun Yuan was purportedly an online gambling and entertainment company, which held a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) licence \u2013 accreditation that previously allowed such entities to operate legally in the Philippines.",
      "A relaxation in gambling regulations under ex-President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 led to a surge of Pogo-driven business activity. But many scam syndicates also found Pogo licences useful for masking their criminal operations \u2013 and PAOCC told the BBC they found evidence that Zun Yuan was running \"pig-butchering\" scams from its office in the compound.",
      "Pig-butchering is a con where scammers take time to build trust with victims by posing as lovers or prospective business partners, then trick them into investing their money into fraudulent schemes.",
      "When shown around the compound by PAOCC officers earlier this month, the BBC found, in a deserted employee dormitory, training scripts on how to scam targets.",
      "\"I want to create my own financial empire,\" a scripted character \u2013 a female crypto expert at an international bank - says to her target, before flattering him and encouraging him to share his dreams. She is told to put her target on hold while pretending to \"cash in on a trade\" - only to declare, moments later, that she had made a killing. She then asks whether he himself knows how to trade, setting him up for the transfer of money that would soon follow.",
      "This is just one of the many ways in which these compounds swindle billions  of dollars around the world. Typically run by Chinese organised crime groups across South East Asia, they are staffed by a mixture of willing employees and trafficked victims who are forced to scam.",
      "According to de la Paz, he and his colleagues found more than 300 foreign nationals in the Bamban compound, many of them working there against their will.",
      "Punishments for disobedient or underperforming workers ranged from beatings to the banal: the BBC was shown a notebook from the compound, in which a worker had copied out  the phrase, \"I will meet my targets tomorrow\", hundreds of times in Chinese.",
      "Enclosed by walls topped with barbed wire, the workers' area of the compound was its own self-contained world, featuring a basketball court, supermarket and restaurants. Employees lived in rooms of six, each with a balcony equipped with a toilet and shower.",
      "Their bosses meanwhile lived in a separate gated enclave, says de la Paz, who showed the BBC one of the villas there.",
      "A marble-clad living room featured a high-end entertainment system, security monitor and ornate hardwood furniture. Behind the house was a swimming pool, beside which was a staircase that led down into what were supposedly escape tunnels, now flooded with water.",
      "By the time security forces stormed the Bamban compound on the evening of 12 March 2024, some of these scam bosses had already eluded capture.",
      "But the raid signalled a shift in the political climate.",
      "In June 2022, just as Guo was being sworn in as mayor, Rodrigo Duterte's presidential term had ended.",
      "His successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, soon began facing calls for a ban on Pogo businesses. Many across Philippine society sounded the alarm about the criminality that often lurked within, despite the millions they brought in as revenue. Their biggest customers were rich Chinese, which led to concerns about foreign influence as Marcos, unlike his predecessor, courted Washington over Beijing.",
      "When the raid in Bamban happened, it exposed a dark underbelly of the Philippines \u2013 and the two worlds of Alice Guo   \u2013 the pink office from where she had sought a political career and the scam compound, which suggested far murkier ambitions      \u2013 collapsed in on one another.",
      "'Amnesia girl'",
      "Guo had been a relatively unknown name in the Philippines until last May when she was called to appear before the Senate to explain her links to the scam compound.",
      "Almost overnight, she became a meme. When she told senators she had grown up on a family farm, it brought swift ridicule from Filipinos who said she was too glamorous for the countryside. She became notorious for her inconsistent, vague comments, as well as her claims to have forgotten basic details of her early life, leading social media to nickname her \"my amnesia girl\".",
      "Guo said she'd had a secluded childhood as the child of a Chinese father and Filipino mother \u2013 but could not remember where in the Philippines her family home had been.",
      "At one point, a senator said to her: \"Please mayor, a little more candour than you have shown so far in answering some of the important questions.\"",
      "She told sceptical senators that she had sold her stake in the land before becoming mayor, and that the issuance of a business permit to Zun Yuan had been a mere administrative measure.",
      "Suspicion mounted when, during the hearings, a court in Singapore convicted two of Guo's Chinese former business partners in the Philippines of money-laundering.",
      "Then, last July, despite the intense public interest in her case, Guo managed to slip through the travel restrictions imposed on her and escape to Indonesia. A few months later, she was re-arrested and returned to the Philippines.",
      "It was also in July that Philippine investigators made a breakthrough. Guo's fingerprints were found to match those on file for a girl from China named Guo Hua Ping, who had arrived in the Philippines alongside her mother, also Chinese, in the early 2000s.",
      "This revelation sparked another line of inquiry in the Senate: the idea that Guo might be a spy, exercising influence or gathering intelligence for the Chinese state. The idea spread quickly among the watching public, dominating public discussion of the case.",
      "Jaye Bekema - a senior officer on the staff of Risa Hontiveros, one of the senators who probed potential links between scam syndicates and Chinese intelligence - says the possibility that Guo was a spy warranted an investigation.",
      "\"I think there should be some clarity as to what a spy means,\" Ms Bekema said, while stressing that there is no conclusive proof of Guo being a spy.",
      "\"I am more likely to believe that she didn't plan to be a spy, but that she was tapped to be one [by the Chinese government] because of her criminal connections and her influence on local politics and the local government.\"",
      "In many ways, Guo had become a victim of her own success. The career she chose and the limelight she worked hard to attract meant that she was fully exposed to public scrutiny when China-Philippines relations soured under Marcos.",
      "As political rhetoric escalated and tensions between the two countries spiralled, not least of all in the South China Sea, the young mayor found herself in the crosshairs of espionage accusations.",
      "Others, however, are more sceptical of the allegation. The Chinese state and Guo would have made strange bedfellows, according to Teresita Ang See, a civic leader in the Chinese-Filipino community.",
      "\"What can she spy on in a place like [Bamban]? It's in central Luzon, it's not near any of the sensitive establishments. Why use her? She's very visible, she flaunts her lifestyle. The last person you would use as a spy would be a person like Alice Guo,\" says Ang See.",
      "The Pogo problem",
      "But those who led the questioning against Guo, such as Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, say that it's more complicated than that.",
      "\"Transnational criminals working around the region know how to tap into... I'll call it local talent to penetrate our society, whether through politics or business,\" he explains.",
      "Either way, Guo's case shed light on the Philippine state's vulnerability to being corrupted and co-opted by criminal groups abusing Pogo licences.",
      "In mid-2024, President Marcos declared a blanket ban on all Pogos, citing their widespread abuse by organised crime.",
      "Gatchalian says that the investigation into Alice Guo helped drive this change.",
      "\"Because of it, there was a groundswell of people really clamouring for a ban,\" he tells the BBC. \"And that's when the president officially banned Pogos.\"",
      "Since then, Philippine police have raided scores of scam hubs across the country. But given how influential the syndicates have become, there are concerns that leaks within the security forces and government institutions are allowing criminals to evade capture, according to Mr de la Paz.",
      "Ms Bekema says she feels certain that some candidates in the upcoming national elections are still being financed with Pogo money, while Ang See says that serving police officers have been found working for the criminal syndicates.",
      "In Bamban, concerns about state infiltration seem far from people's minds.",
      "The streets are decked with brightly-coloured campaign posters for the upcoming municipal elections. The Municipal Hall has been whitewashed, and the flowers have been removed.",
      "Guo is currently on trial in six separate cases, potentially facing decades in prison, and has been barred from running for public office again. She has pleaded not guilty to human trafficking charges.",
      "Yet many still treasure the memory of their embattled ex-mayor.",
      "One of those currently standing for Bamban councillor is Miah Mejia's father, Fortunato, a garrulous 69-year-old, who also ran in 2022 as a member of Alice's party, although he lost. He even featured in one of her publicity videos at the time.",
      "He says that the people of Bamban had taken a chance by electing Guo, but that she had good connections to Chinese investors and had delivered on all her promises to the townspeople.",
      "He is also indifferent to the Senate's evidence that Guo was not a Filipino.",
      "\"That's what they've been showing, but we still don't believe it because we don't care whether she's Filipino or not,\" he says. \"What's important is whether or not she helps us.\"",
      "Mr Mejia is adamant that the Alice Guo he knew would not have been involved in human trafficking.",
      "\"Never, ever would she do something like that,\" he says, flatly. \"I know she has a heart. She fears the Lord.\"",

      "A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.",
      "The 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.",
      "Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.",
      "Another was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.",
      "Her toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.",
      "\"My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,\" Fatima says.",
      "She says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.",
      "At first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time.",
      "But then the burns and scars appeared.",
      "Skin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.",
      "Women in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.",
      "The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.",
      "Other ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.",
      "Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.",
      "The skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.",
      "The situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.",
      "It is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.",
      "\"A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,\" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology clinic in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.",
      "She estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.",
      "Some were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.",
      "One of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.",
      "However, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.",
      "So users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.",
      "Fatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.",
      "\"They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,\" she says.",
      "They have both lost potential fianc\u00e9s because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.",
      "I visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves \"mixologists\" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.",
      "The market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold.",
      "Some pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.",
      "I noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.",
      "Other sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.",
      "I also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.",
      "One woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.",
      "\"Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,\" she said.",
      "One seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies \"glow\", or to look \"radiant and shiny\".",
      "Most seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.",
      "One salesman said he used \"a lot of kojic\" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.",
      "The approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.",
      "I even saw salesmen giving women injections.",
      "Dr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.",
      "He also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.",
      "But he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.",
      "\"Some of them are just being transported in unlabelled containers, so if you do not take them to the labs for evaluation, you can't tell what is inside.\"",
      "Fatima says her actions will haunt her forever, especially if her children's scars do not fade.",
      "\"When I confided in my mum about what I did, due to her behaviour, and when she heard the dangers of the cream and what stigma her grandchildren are facing, she was sad that they had to go through that and apologised,\" she says.",

    "title": "What makes a rum Jamaican? Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

    "summary": "As Conan O'Brien was honored with the Mark Twain Prize at the Kennedy Center, many comics targeted President Trump from the stage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",
      "The ceremony will be streamed on Netflix on May 4.",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",
      "Last month, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame announced Carey as one of its 2025 nominees.",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon.

With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth.",
      "That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets people\u00a0people with disabilities\u00a0save money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income and\u00a0Medicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month.",
      "\"With this ABLE account, we don't have to worry as much,\" said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul's mother, with whom he lives. \"It's nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him.\"",

Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",

    "summary": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles not manufactured in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act, the Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday.",
      "\"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the debt limit remains unchanged, the government's ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will probably be exhausted in August or September 2025,\" the nonpartisan budget office said Wednesday.",
      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",
      "The CBO analysis noted that if the government's borrowing needs are \"significantly greater\" than projections, the Treasury Department's resources could be exhausted as early as late May or June.",
      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue. Last month, the House included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion in its budget proposal, which serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. But the Senate has been pursuing a different budget measure that does not include a debt limit increase.",
      "In recent days, Republicans in Congress have been working to reconcile the two approaches as they look to make headway on the complicated process to implement the president's agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met Tuesday afternoon with top tax leaders as they work to unite behind a plan on the path forward. And Thune told reporters he's hopeful lawmakers will be able to address the debt limit as part of the budget process.",

      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",

      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-infrastructure-c-engineers-slightly-better-4-years-ago/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:34:50 -0400",
    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",

      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",

Mr. Trump on Monday also threatened 25% tariffs against any nation that continues to buy oil or gas from Venezuela as of April 2.

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",

      "Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles.",

      "Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issued a one-month reprieve to U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he also issued a pause until Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Caldwell says that she suspects that in \"many cases\" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them.",
      "\"Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,\" Caldwell added.",
      "She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\"",
      "In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.",
      "When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"",

An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures.

      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000.

You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.",
      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",
      "With evolving drone and space warfare likely to be the center of any fight with China, Dan Grazier, a military procurement analyst, questions whether \"another exquisite manned fighter jet really is the right platform going forward.\" Grazier, director of the national security reform program at the Stimson Center, said $20 billion is \"just seed money. The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",
      "Few details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although Trump said early versions have been conducting test flights for the last five years. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.",
      "A separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration's Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.",
      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said.",

      "A number of tourists from Europe say they have been stopped at U.S. border crossings and held at U.S. immigration detention facilities for weeks, despite holding tourist permits, work visas, or otherwise believing that they are authorized to travel to the U.S.",
      "A backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada.",
      "And German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fianc\u00e9, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime.",
      "Sielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody.",
      "\"What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,\" his fianc\u00e9, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that \"the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.\"",
      "\"The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios told the Associated Press.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed \"inadmissible\" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that \"if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\"",
      "Consider \"delaying personal travel\" abroad",

      "Could trade war weigh on tourism to U.S.?",
      "A recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade war could also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S. just by alienating key allies and trade partners.",
      "Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025.",
      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process. They also announced recently that Social Security field offices across the country will be closing.",
      "Of the 47 SSA field offices listed for closure on the website for the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, 26 are slated for closure this year, with some taking effect as early as next month, according to an Associated Press analysis of the data.",
      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \"will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \"not only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\"",
      "\"SSA needs to be transparent about its service changes and seek input from the older Americans who will be affected. Because any delay in Social Security caused by this change can mean real economic hardship,\" LeaMond said.",
      "Agency leaders said Tuesday that the agency would begin training frontline employees and management about the new policy for the next two weeks.",
      "Pushback from Democrats came quickly. A group of 62 House Democrats wrote Wednesday to the agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, to express concern about how the changes could hurt older beneficiaries in remote areas and people with limited internet access.",
      "\"Requiring beneficiaries to seek assistance exclusively online, through artificial intelligence, or in person at SSA field offices would create additional barriers, particularly for those who live far from an office,\" they wrote. \"We strongly urge you to consider the individuals who may be harmed.\"",

      "\"We're looking out for seniors by doing this,\" Fields said.",
      "In announcing the changes, Dudek said that the agency sees $100 million in direct deposit fraud every year. However, congressional testimony from an official with the SSA inspector general in May 2023 said that \"from January 2013 through May 2018 fraudsters redirected $33.5 million in benefits intended for 20,878 beneficiaries\" and made unauthorized direct deposit changes through the agency's website.",
      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",
      "Altman, of the advocacy group, believes the administration's ultimate goal is to privatize the Social Security system.",
      "Travel concerns for low-income seniors",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he is concerned that \"some of our oldest Kentuckians, who are living on a fixed income, who don't have the resources to travel, have to travel hours to get basic questions answered.\"",
      "\"Why? Because they don't want them to do it, and they want to be able to kick them off. It's not right,\" the Democrat said. \"These are people who qualify and the federal government has an obligation to have enough offices, call-in or other resources to ultimately process the applications that are out there and answer the questions that people have.",
      "\"My concern is that what Elon Musk is trying to do is break government, not fix it.\"",

      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",

      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies.\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles not manufactured in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday visited the high-security El Salvador prison where Venezuelans who the Trump administration alleges are gang members have been held since their removal from the United States. The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "An appeals court Wednesday kept in place an order barring the administration from deporting more Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "A central outstanding question about the deportees' status is when and how they could ever be released from the prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, as they are not serving sentences. They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",
      "They were later shown at the prison kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform \u2014 knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs \u2014 and placed in cells.",
      "For three years, El Salvador has been operating under a state of emergency that suspends fundamental rights as Bukele wages an all-out assault on the country's powerful street gangs. During that time, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties and jailed, often without due process.",
      "Bukele offered to hold U.S. deportees in the prison when Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited in February.",
      "At the prison Wednesday, El Salvador Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro showed Noem a cell holding Salvadorans he said had been there since the prison opened. \"No one expects that these people can go back to society and behave,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026.\u00a0The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",

      "The Atlantic on Wednesday posted screenshots and a fuller text chain from the Signal group chat that inadvertently included a journalist, after the White House and top administration officials on the chat claimed no \"war plans\" were discussed.",
      "The screenshots show the timing and targets of the attack on Houthis in Yemen earlier this month were shared by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and discussed in the chat. The White House has stated \u2014 and Cabinet officials testified Tuesday \u2014 the information in the group chat wasn't classified, even though Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg received tactical details before the attack.",
      "At 11:44 a.m. ET on Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, according to screenshots provided by The Atlantic: \"TEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.\" The ensuing message included the timing of the expected strikes and what type of weapons would be used.",
      "\"This Signal message shows that the U.S. secretary of defense texted a group that included a phone number unknown to him\u2014Goldberg's cellphone\u2014at 11:44 a.m.,\" Goldberg and Shane Harris wrote in The Atlantic. \"This was 31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi 'Target Terrorist,' was expected to be killed by these American aircraft.\"",
      "\"If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests\u2014or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media\u2014the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds,\" Goldberg and Harris continued. \"The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House has not denied the authenticity of the messages, but is sticking with its characterization of the information and continued to attack Goldberg.",
      "\"The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT 'war plans,'\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Wednesday morning. \"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.\"",
      "\"No locations,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz wrote on X Wednesday morning. \"No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE:\u00a0 President Trump is protecting America and our interests.\"",
      "He asserted that the sources of the intelligence were not discussed but did not address the timing or weapons packages used in the strikes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in group chat, posted on social media that Goldberg \"oversold what he had,\" and said the classified information that Goldberg claimed CIA director John Ratcliffe shared was \"the name of his chief of staff.\"",
      "Under questioning by Democrats at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Trump administration intelligence officials denied that the information in the chat was classified. Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who were both in the Houthi chat group, were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",
      "The Atlantic said it asked Trump administration officials and the White House if they objected to publishing the messages in light of their denials that the messages contained classified information or \"war plans.\" Most did not respond, and Leavitt told The Atlantic the administration objected to the release, while insisting there was \"no classified information transmitted in the group chat.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",
      "While Congress has the power to regulate voting \u2014 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" for elections.",
      "Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an \"unlawful\" weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is \"trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\" And Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order \"is not just misguided \u2014 it is immoral and illegal.\"",
      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",
      "Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a \"welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.\"",
      "At least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post, \"This will not stand. We will sue.\"",
      "The president has long claimed elections were being rigged, even before the results were known. He's battled certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, falsely blaming\u00a0widespread fraud for his loss.",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials said they are cutting $11.4 billion in COVID-19-related funds for state and local public health departments \u2014 money that was largely used for COVID-19 testing, virus research and community health jobs.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The statement said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0expects to recover the money beginning 30 days after termination notices, which began being sent out on Monday. The move was first reported by NBC News.",
      "\"This is just one in a series of many, many cuts we're seeing across health agencies across the country,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on CBS News 24/7 on Wednesday.",
      "\"This ... is money that had been going to state, local, territorial, tribal health departments across the country, and as we know, as was the case with a lot of COVID funding, it was not just supporting COVID-related programs, but many other things,\" she said, noting wastewater surveillance\u00a0as one example of what's being lost with these cuts, which helps experts look for infectious diseases and other toxins in the water.",
      "\"This has direct applications to the measles outbreak in West Texas right now. It gives us an early warning system for where there might be measles in other areas, where they need to be focusing measles vaccinations, and that program is falling victim to this,\" Gounder said. \"And state (and) local health departments really depend on that CDC money. The CDC functions as a funnel of funding to the state and local level, and in some cases, it's 90% of their budget.\"",
      "Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said much of the funding was set to end soon anyway. \"It's ending in the next six months,\" she said. \"There's no reason \u2014 why rescind it now? It's just cruel and unusual behavior.\"",
      "Minnesota Commissioner of Health Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement, \"We learned yesterday that the federal government has unilaterally terminated approximately $226 million in grants to Minnesota Department of Health related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This termination is effective immediately and impacts ongoing work and contracts. This action was sudden and unexpected.\"",
      "She added, \"It will take time to figure out all of the impacts of this action, but these cuts are a tremendous loss \u2014 made worse by the uncertainty and chaos that our federal partners have introduced into this process.\"",
      "California Department of Public Health Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan said in a statement the department \"received notice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that it intends to immediately end state and local public health funding awarded during COVID-19 that supports respiratory virus monitoring, testing and response, immunizations and vaccines for children, and health disparities efforts.\"",
      "\"This funding supports the public health work and data systems improved during the pandemic that helped California fill gaps in its existing public health infrastructure, including ongoing response to COVID-19 disease and other respiratory and vaccine-preventable diseases that require similar resources,\" Pan said. \"We are working to evaluate the impact of these actions. All Californians deserve to live in healthy and thriving communities, which is the role of public health. CDPH remains committed to seeking the resources required to support the critical, lifesaving infrastructure needed to keep people healthy and protect them against infectious disease, vaccine-preventable diseases and health emergencies.\"",
      "In a related move, more than two dozen COVID-related research grants funded by the National Institutes of Health have been canceled. Earlier this month, the Trump administration shut down ordering from covidtest.gov, the site where Americans could have COVID-19 tests delivered to their mailboxes for no charge.",
      "Although the COVID federal public health emergency has ended, the virus is still killing Americans: 458 people per week on average have died from COVID over the past four weeks,\u00a0according to CDC data.",
      "HHS wouldn't provide many details about how the federal government expects to recover the money from what it called \"impacted recipients.\" But HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an email: \"The $11.4 billion is undisbursed funds remaining.\"",
      "Freeman said her understanding is that state health departments already had the COVID money.",
      "\"The funding was authorized by Congress, was appropriated by Congress, and it was out the door, basically, into the hands of the grantees\" \u2014 states, she said, which decide how to distribute it locally.",
      "Under both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, billions of dollars was allocated for COVID response through legislation, including a COVID relief bill and the American Rescue Plan Act.",

      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld by a federal appeals court on March 26. A White House spokesperson said it plans to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, has questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese decent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "summary": "Due to \"ongoing litigation,\" the Department of Government Efficiency removed details from its website on the more than 3,000 USAID contracts it claims to have canceled.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency is no longer publishing details of canceled U.S. Agency for International Development contracts due to what's described as \"legal reason[s]\" on its website.",
      "The change is \"related to ongoing litigation,\" a White House administration official told CBS News. It is not clear which litigation challenging the dismantling of USAID caused DOGE to remove information about canceled contracts from its \"Wall of Receipts\" site. The official did not respond when asked for more information.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the 3,214 USAID contracts listed on DOGE's website contain no information other than the total contract value and the amount DOGE claims to have saved by canceling them. The canceled USAID contracts represent about 45% of the total number of itemized contracts on DOGE's website, and 57% of the $21.6 billion it claims to have saved from terminated contracts.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that DOGE likely violated the constitution when it acted to shutter USAID. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents DOGE from taking further action related to the shutdown of USAID.",
      "The USAID contracts alone total $12.4 billion in alleged savings, though multiple experts in federal contracting have said the method DOGE is using to calculate savings is flawed. DOGE uses the total potential value of a contract, which is often far higher than the actual amount an agency ends up spending, to estimate savings. The actual amount of funding cut as a result of USAID contract terminations is closer to $6.7 billion as of Tuesday, according to an analysis by former USAID data analyst Brian Banks.",
      "Multiple news outlets, including CBS News, have also identified errors in DOGE's accounting, with some contracts being double or triple counted. Many of the original errors have been removed but it's not clear if they are still included in the total $103 billion DOGE has claimed to have saved.",
      "DOGE, led by billionaire and President Trump's senior advisor Elon Musk, originally touted the list of canceled contracts as evidence of increased transparency.",
      "\"We're very public with what we do,\" Musk said in an interview with Ted Cruz on March 17. \"I don't know how we could be more transparent. Literally every action that we do, small or large, we post on the DOGE.gov website.\"",
      "With the removal of the USAID contract details, it's unclear what international aid programs the task force is ending.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of over 5,000 terminated USAID grants, awards and contracts, up to date as of March 12. The cancellations included at least $1.39 billion in efforts to fight disease and support global health, including $1.1 billion in fighting malaria. The terminated contracts also included at least $171.7 million in programs providing access to food and clean water and $435.2 million in efforts to provide access to education abroad.",

    "summary": "President Trump's national security adviser has denied knowing the editor of The Atlantic after accidentally adding him to a sensitive group chat.",
    "story": [
      "The editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, has nothing to say about his relationship with national security adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently added him to a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Yemen days ago.",
      "\"I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz,\" Goldberg told CBS News in an interview Wednesday.",
      "Waltz claimed he has \"never met\" with Goldberg, wouldn't be able to pick him out of a police lineup and trashed his reputation, calling him \"the bottom scum of journalists.\" But photos surfaced online earlier Wednesday of the two together at an event at the French Embassy in 2021.",
      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump Cabinet members sent texts on Signal, one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia, but the White House says he didn't have his phone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",

    "summary": "The Department of Education's civil rights office says it launched a Title IX probe in Portland, Oregon, after a trans student-athlete won races at a girls' track meet.",
    "story": [
      "Public school administrators in Portland, Oregon, are facing a federal civil rights probe over a transgender student-athlete's alleged participation in a girls' track and field meet last week, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday.",
      "The department's Office of Civil Rights has opened an investigation into Portland's school district and the Oregon School Activities Association, a nonprofit that oversees high school sports statewide. Federal officials accused both the school district and the nonprofit of violating Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination and is used at times to challenge trans women and girls who compete on women's and girls' teams.",
      "In this case, the civil rights office has alleged that Portland Public Schools and the activities association  allowed a trans runner to compete in the girls' division of a March 19 interscholastic track and field competition, potentially undercutting Title IX as the runner took first place in two races. The office also said allowing the trans student to use the girls' locker room during the event may violate the statute.",
      "The civil rights office said it sent letters to Kimberly Armstrong, the superintendent of Portland Public Schools, and the activities association, which is the governing body for the Portland Interscholastic League, to inform them of the probe. The office is specifically looking into the activities association's \"gender identity participation\" policy to determine whether it could violate the terms of Title IX.",
      "That policy, according to the activities association, aims to give students opportunities to participate in athletic programs that align with their gender identities, while also upholding safe and fair standards for all students. Developed with the Oregon Department of Education, the activities association  says its policy \"promotes harmony and fair competition among member schools by maintaining equality of eligibility\" and gives more students a chance to participate in interscholastic activities.",
      "The federal civil rights office said it launched the investigation after receiving a complaint that blamed the school district and the activities association  for allegedly allowing an athlete not assigned female at birth \"to compete in the girls' track and field division over the last two seasons.\" The complaint noted the trans runner had won two races \u2014 the girls' 200-meter and 400-meter \u2014 at an interscholastic championship meet in Portland last year and again this year.",
      "\"We will not allow the Portland Public Schools District or any other educational entity that receives federal funds to trample on the antidiscrimination protections that women and girls are guaranteed under law,\" Craig Trainor, the Education Department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. \"OCR will use every lawful means to ensure that no female athlete is denied equal athletic opportunities or robbed of her rightful accolades.\"",
      "President Trump's return to office in January, and subsequent executive order declaring that \"only two sexes\" will be recognized by the federal government, set the stage for these kinds of investigations to move forward. Standing against the ability of trans athletes to compete in girls' or women's sports was a substantial part of his election campaign, as it had already become a political flashpoint for a number of Republican leaders.",
      "A spokesperson for the activities association told CBS News Wednesday that the organization had just learned about the federal investigation and was consulting its legal counsel to respond to the Department of Education. Armstrong, from the Portland school district, acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the federal civil rights office did receive a complaint, sparking the probe. She said Portland Public Schools \"is fully cooperating with the investigation.\"",
      "\"I stand firm in our legal responsibilities, and I deeply value every student's right to be treated with dignity, safety, and respect,\" her statement continued. Citing \"this complex legal landscape,\" Armstrong added that the district's policies comply with Oregon state laws, \"which may differ from federal guidance.\"",
      "\"While I am limited in what I can share at this time due to the sensitive nature of the matter and our duty to protect student privacy, I want to be clear: my commitment\u2014and our district's commitment\u2014to doing what's right for all students, especially those most vulnerable, remains unwavering,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:04:29 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district court ordered the Department of Education to restore access to grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to intervene in an ongoing dispute over Department of Education grants that were canceled because they funded programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "In a filing with the high court, the Justice Department requested the justices put on hold a temporary order from a lower court requiring the Education Department to restore millions of dollars in grants for recipients in eight states that challenged the cancellations.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to provide relief to the Justice Department and agreed with the district court that the terminations of the grants likely violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "Echoing concerns raised in other emergency appeals filed with the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris took aim at the scope of the lower court's order. The Trump administration has in recent days focused its attacks on nationwide injunctions. More than a dozen have been issued by district courts considering legal challenges to President Trump's policies.",
      "\"This court should put a swift end to federal district courts' unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions,\" she wrote.",
      "The Justice Department has also asked the Supreme Court to step into court fights over Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship and efforts to fire thousands of federal probationary employees. The high court has yet to act on their bids for emergency relief.",
      "The grant programs at issue in the case, the Teacher Quality Partnership program and the Supporting Effective Educator Development program, or TQP and SEED, relate to efforts to improve the development and quality of teachers. In early February, the acting education secretary ordered a review of all grant awards to ensure that they did not fund so-called DEI practices, which the Trump administration have said are discriminatory. The review found that 104 grants should be terminated because they conflicted with the department's policy objectives.",
      "Roughly one month after the grants were canceled, the eight states filed a lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order from a federal district judge in Massachusetts. Public and private universities, as well as nonprofit groups, in their states received the TQP and SEED grants from the federal government.",
      "The states \u2014 California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin \u2014 argued that the grant cancellations violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the agency rulemaking process, in part because the Department of Education failed to \"provide a transparent and reasonable explanation for the termination of the grants.\"",
      "The district court in Massachusetts issued a temporary restraining order, initially set to remain in place for 14 days, that ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the grants for all recipients in the states. It also temporarily blocked the Education Department from canceling any further grants for beneficiaries in the challenger states.",
      "While the administration began working to reinstate access to the funds, it asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the lower court's order and allow it to continue with the grant cancellations.",
      "But the 1st Circuit rejected the Department of Education's request. The district court later extended its temporary order to remain in place up to April 7 while it considered a bid for longer-term relief.",
      "The case from Massachusetts is not the only challenge to the Education Department's decision to scrap DEI-related grants. In a second dispute filed in Maryland, a federal district court separately ordered the administration to reinstate canceled TQP and SEED grants for members of teacher-education groups.",
      "In its bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration warned that the two orders from courts in Maryland and Massachusetts potentially overlap. The government reiterated its opposition to the broad injunctions that have been issued by district courts in the slew of cases.",
      "\"Unless and until this court addresses that question, federal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the Executive Branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep paying for programs that the Executive Branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never be clawed back,\" Harris wrote.",
      "She argued that the temporary restraining order gives relief to all grant recipients in the states, instead of limiting it to the states or their instrumentalities. The district court, Harris wrote, directed a federal agency and its leaders to immediately make available millions of dollars to fund programs that they determined do not align with the administration's objectives.",
      "\"That is a remarkable intrusion on the operations of the Executive Branch, and the kind of judicial action that this court has routinely decided to review,\" she said.",
      "On the merits of the case, the acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, said the Massachusetts court did not have jurisdiction to consider the states' claims, since the case is effectively a contract dispute that should be heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:54:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court was considering a challenge to a 2022 regulation that sought to regulate ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, delivering a win for federal efforts to curb gun violence.",
      "The high court ruled 7-2 in finding that the rule from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is not facially inconsistent with federal firearms law. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the opinion for the majority.",
      "\"The GCA embraces, and thus permits ATF to regulate, some weapon parts kits and unfinished frames or receivers, including those we have discussed,\" Gorsuch wrote, referencing the Gun Control Act of 1968.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court did not involve the Second Amendment, but whether ATF went too far when it issued the rule subjecting ghost guns to the same requirements as commercial firearms.",
      "It follows a decision from the high court last year that struck down a measure from the first Trump administration that outlawed bump stocks, which are devices that increase a firearm's rate of fire. It's unclear whether President Trump will keep the regulation in place or take steps to rescind it.",
      "Gorsuch's opinion included images of a \"Buy Build Shoot\" weapon parts kit from Polymer80, a seller of the kits, and a completed firearm constructed from the parts. He called the finished product \"an instrument of combat.\"",
      "\"No one would confuse the semiautomatic pistol pictured above with a tool or a toy,\" he wrote. \"Of course, as sold, the kit requires some assembly. But a number of considerations persuade us that, even as sold, the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit qualifies as a 'weapon.'\"",
      "Gorsuch acknowledged that while it may take roughly 30 minutes to construct a firearm out of the kit, it \"comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious.\"",
      "\"Really, the kit's name says it all: 'Buy Build Shoot,'\" he wrote.",
      "Writing in dissent, Thomas accused the majority of rewriting the law to regulate weapon parts kits and said it \"blesses the government's overreach based on a series of errors.\"",
      "\"Congress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one. But, it did not,\" he said. \"I would adhere to the words Congress enacted.\"",
      "Gun violence prevention groups cheered the Supreme Court's decision, calling it a victory for public safety.",
      "\"Ghost guns are the gun industry's way of skirting commonsense gun laws and arming dangerous people without background checks. We are thrilled that the Supreme Court has upheld the ATF rule that treats ghost guns as what they are: guns,\" said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel, Giffords Law Center, in a statement.",
      "The court was considering an appeal from the Biden administration of a lower court ruling that struck down the measure.",
      "The regulation, issued in 2022, sought to address a surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, which can be made with 3D printers or kits and parts available online. The weapons don't have serial numbers or transfer records, making them difficult for law enforcement to trace and attractive to people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms.",
      "The rule clarified the definition of \"firearm\" in the Gun Control Act of 1968 to include a weapon parts kit that can be assembled into an operational weapon in less than 30 minutes, and the incomplete frame of a handgun or receiver of a rifle.",
      "By seeking to regulate the kits under the decades-old law, the rule subjects ghost gun manufacturers and sellers to the same requirements as commercial gun makers, meaning they have to be licensed, mark their products with serial numbers, maintain certain records and run background checks on interested buyers.",
      "Shortly before the regulation took effect, gun owners, advocacy groups and the makers of parts kits challenged it in federal court, arguing that ATF didn't have the authority to change the definition of \"firearm\" to cover weapon parts kits.",
      "A federal district court judge and a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit struck down the rule. The appeals court found that Congress did not authorize ATF to regulate kits under the Gun Control Act.",
      "The Biden administration had warned the Supreme Court that if it were to strike down the rule, then minors, criminals and others who cannot have guns could instead buy kits that could be assembled into a functioning, untraceable firearm in a matter of minutes.",
      "The Justice Department said the measure has been successful at addressing the surge in crimes committed using ghost guns, and the market for the weapons has effectively collapsed in the nearly two years the rule has been in place.",
      "A group of major U.S. cities also said the regulation has been effective at reducing the use of ghost guns in their municipalities. In New York, ghost gun recoveries fell in 2023 for the first time in four years, and in Baltimore, they decreased in 2023 for the first time since 2019.",
      "During an earlier stage in the litigation over the Biden administration's rule, the Supreme Court allowed ATF to enforce the requirements until it issued a decision.",
      "The court's majority said that there are limits to its decision, and that while some parts kits qualify as weapons that can be regulated, not all do.",
      "\"Weapon parts kits vary widely. Not all come as complete as the 'Buy Build Shoot' kit. Some, too, may require more time, expertise, or specialized tools to finish,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"And at some point a kit may be so incomplete or cumbersome to assemble that it can no longer fairly be described as a 'weapon,'\" capable of being converted into a working firearm.",

      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations. The department is currently utilizing so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to delay a default for several months.",

      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",
      "The CBO estimate came after the Bipartisan Policy Center projected on Monday that the U.S. could default on its debt between July and October without congressional intervention. The Treasury Department is also expected to release a projected X-date in the coming weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders have weighed how to address the issue. Last month, the House included a provision that would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion in its budget proposal, which serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. But the Senate has been pursuing a different budget measure that does not include a debt limit increase.",
      "In recent days, Republicans in Congress have been working to reconcile the two approaches as they look to make headway on the complicated process to implement the president's agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune met Tuesday afternoon with top tax leaders as they work to unite behind a plan on the path forward.

      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address on March 4. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Egede responded at the time, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "Egede said Mr. Trump was, \"very unpredictable, in such a way that people feel insecure.\" In an election that was held on March 11 \u2014 after Mr. Trump's speech \u00a0\u2014 Egede's opposition won, although the party still needs to form a coalition government.",
      "\"Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside,\" Democratic party leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen told local media, according to BBC News. \"There is a need for unity, so we will enter into negotiations with everyone.\"",

      "\"You have Russia that is trying to become king of the Arctic with 60 plus icebreakers, some of them nuclear powered,\" Waltz said in January. \"You know how many we have? We have two and one just caught on fire. This is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's son,\u00a0Donald Trump Jr., visited in January before the president took office. Ahead of his visit, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that Greenland is not for sale, but she said she would continue to welcome American interest and investment.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continues to insist it didn't defy a federal judge's order when it failed to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order blocking the deportations of alleged gang members who hadn't been afforded due process. It's a case that's become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and federal courts.",
      "In a 14-page document\u00a0filed late Tuesday night, the Justice Department spelled out before Boasberg why it didn't turn around the two flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members despite his verbal order to do so.",
      "\"These removals both complied with the law and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. The Government will continue to defend the removals before this Court and, if necessary, on appeal challenging this Court's two injunctions issued on March 15,\" the filing reads. It's signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior DOJ officials.",
      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. The law has only been invoked three times throughout American history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's assertions that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She's the one who didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, also an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\"\u00a0the judge wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg.",
      "In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Just after midnight Monday, Mr. Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg's impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.",

    "summary": "President Trump told reporters he does not believe national security adviser Mike Waltz should apologize for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal group chat.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday defended national security adviser Mike Waltz as his administration faces questions about its use of the encrypted messaging app Signal after a reporter was mistakenly added to a group chat detailing highly sensitive plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the information that was discussed on the 18-member group chat, which included high-ranking officials like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was not classified and said Waltz is a \"very good man\" who will \"continue to do a good job.\"",
      "\"I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best,\" the president said of Waltz. \"It's equipment and technology that's not perfect and probably he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night, Waltz called the situation \"embarrassing\" and said he takes \"full responsibility,\" adding that he \"built\" the Signal chat group.",
      "However, he claimed that he did not have Goldberg's contact information on his phone and is unsure how Goldberg's number got there, or how Goldberg got into the chat.",
      "\"I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,\" Waltz said. \"And we're going to figure out how this happened.\"",
      "Waltz also said that a staffer did not put Goldberg's contact information into the phone.",
      "The Trump administration's use of the app to detail the plans to bomb Houthi targets on March 15 was revealed Monday by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who wrote in a piece that he was added to a chat on Signal by an account that shared Waltz's name earlier this month.",
      "Several days later, an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out plans for strikes in Yemen, which included information about \"weapons packages, targets and timing\" shortly before the attack took place, Goldberg wrote.",
      "Among those included in the chat were accounts that appeared to belong to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg's account. Witkoff was in Moscow when he was added to the group chat, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting found.",
      "Hegseth denied any war plans were discussed, but the National Security Council said in a statement to CBS News on Monday that the message thread detailed by Goldberg \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The breach sparked immediate condemnation of the Trump administration from congressional Democrats and raised questions about the use of Signal on government or personal devices, as well as whether top U.S. officials were sharing classified information.",
      "In a letter sent to Mr. Trump Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \"Hegseth should be fired immediately.\"",
      "\"The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans\u2014including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used\u2014during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,\" Jeffries wrote. \"His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters that he believes his administration will limit its use of Signal in the future, though he acknowledged that \"a lot of people\" across the federal government rely on the app.",
      "\"I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again,\" he said. \"We may be forced to use it. We may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety and may be forced to use it. Generally speaking, I think we won't be using it very much.\"",
      "The president questioned whether the app has vulnerabilities that allow other users to hack into conversations.",
      "\"I think Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Waltz said technical experts and legal teams will look into the issue.",
      "\"Of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,\" he said. \"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger.\"",
      "Waltz later attacked Goldberg and claimed he and other reporters in Washington, D.C., have \"made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.\"",
      "\"This one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we're looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" he said.",
      "Waltz told the president that Goldberg is attempting to deflect attention away from the \"freedom that you're enabling,\" and said \"the world owes President Trump a favor.\"",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard both appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Tuesday and faced questions from senators about the controversy. The two denied classified information was exchanged in the group chat, but Ratcliffe confirmed he was a participant in the thread.",
      "Ratcliffe added that Signal was on his agency computer when he took the helm of the CIA earlier this year and said it's \"permissible\" to use it to communicate and coordinate \"for work purposes.\"",

      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",

The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/consumer-confidence-falls-tariffs-inflation-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:02:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumer confidence continues to wane as Americans worry about the economy, jobs and their income.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly anxious about their financial prospects, with a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low amid growing concerns about tariffs and inflation.",
      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",
      "\"If the public conversation turns from spending cuts to tax cut happy talk, consumer sentiment could rebound. But in the meantime, the economy is likely to slow and underperform its growth in 2023 and 2024,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:43:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The new findings come from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which sits on a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",
      "Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon.",
      "It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.",

      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",

      "Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, called the cuts \"self-defeating,\" since the office was established to help support a growing commercial space sector. Gallaudet now works as a consultant for space companies.",
      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy playbook, even called for Republicans to \"elevate\" the Office of Space Commerce, saying the office \"should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. leadership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.\"",
      "One of the employees who remains on leave, Cole Donovan, served as an international affairs specialist within the Office of Space Commerce. His work focused on regulations and coordination between private space companies in the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"For my division, specifically, we don't have an expert anymore on EU law and EU regulation,\" he said. \"We had been helping U.S. companies navigate that process.\"",
      "Committee Democrats have asked Secretary Lutnick whether impacts to the U.S. space industry were assessed before the firings took place. They also asked whether any communications occurred between SpaceX representatives and officials from the Department of Commerce, NOAA or the Office of Space Commerce.",
      "The lawmakers also want to know whether the Office of Space Commerce will be compelled to grant DOGE access to proprietary data from SpaceX competitors that could potentially be disclosed to Musk and SpaceX.",
      "\"These unprecedented conflicts of interest threaten to destabilize the entire U.S. commercial space sector if they are not immediately addressed,\" they write in the letter.",

The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",
      "The messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week have all contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to shrink the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services by nearly a quarter, the officials\u00a0announced Thursday, as part of a major restructuring of the department.",
      "The changes announced Thursday amount to a workforce that will be around 33% smaller than it was at the end of the Biden administration, according to federal records. There were around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, up from 81,917 at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "Around 10,000 full-time employees will be cut through the layoffs, in addition to other vacant positions that will not be replaced. Thousands of full-time staff have already left the department in recent months, in addition to thousands more contractor and fellowship positions that were also eliminated.",
      "\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.",
      "A fact sheet shared with reporters and senior health officials says that \"no additional cuts are currently planned\" beyond those announced Thursday and in recent weeks.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration, according to the fact sheet. The administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\"This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors,\" the fact sheet says of the FDA changes.",
      "At the CDC, the department says the workforce will decline by around 2,400 employees, to \"focus on returning to its core mission of preparing for and respond to epidemics and outbreaks.\" One U.S. official said the cuts are not intended to undermine infectious disease work at the agency.",
      "From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the workforce will decline by \"approximately 300 employees, with a focus on reducing minor duplication\" at CMS, which had already been facing hiring limits due to a budget crunch in recent years. The reorganization will not impact Medicare or Medicaid services, it says.",
      "The department's reduction-in-force \"is primarily aimed at administrative positions,\" according to a letter sent Thursday to unions in mutliple HHS agencies, but \"will also target roles in high-cost regions\" and who are \"determined to be redundant or duplicative\" with others.",
      "\"Specific notices to employees may be sent as early as Friday, March 28,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in video\u00a0annoncement shared Thursday by the department.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported details of the reorganization.",
      "Health officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping restructuring architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.",
      "Several health agency officials said they had seen stepped up security measures coming into work this morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.",
      "One major change announced earlier this month would result in significantly cutting the number of general counsel offices, shrinking the ranks of the department's attorneys. One health official said the closures would amount to eliminating two-thirds of the HHS regional attorneys.",
      "Kennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.",
      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies.\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of department sand agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.",
      "The new administration will consolidate work from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxc Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthy \"into a new, unified entity,\" the department said.",
      "This new AHA agency also effectively combines many of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities under one roof, ranging from this year's update to federal dietary guidelines to public health statements about the use of fluoride. The work will be supported by the U.S. surgeon general, the fact sheet says.",
      "The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which was elevated into a separate agency under the Biden administration to oversee tasks like the pandemic stockpile, will be abosrbed into the CDC.",
      "Work from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.",
      "And the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy acknowledged in his remarks.",
      "Details of who exactly will be cut from the department within the agencies remain unclear, under the new reorganization plans. As of Thursday morning, multiple federal health officials said they had received little guidance from the department, aside from Kennedy's announcement.",
      "In his remarks in the video, Kennedy said that they were \"focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and frontline health providers\" in the changes.",

Hodak, of Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, was a gunner aboard a B-29 \"Superfortress\" aircraft. These planes had multiple machine guns, held over 20,000 pounds of bombs and were especially suited to fly to Japan from bases in China during World War II, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.",
      "Hodak's plane was shot down while on a mission to Tokyo. He was initially reported as missing in action, the DPAA said, but investigators learned he had been captured after the plane was taken down. He was taken to the Tokyo Military Prison.",
      "In late May 1945, U.S. aircraft heavily bombed Tokyo, causing huge fires and burning hundreds of structures, according to Military.com. One of the destroyed buildings was the Tokyo Military Prison. Hodak was among the service members being held there at the time. None of the people imprisoned at the facility survived the blaze, Military.com reported. They were buried in a mass grave.",
      "The American Graves Registration Service disinterred 65 sets of remains from the prison in early 1946, after World War II ended. The service was able to identify 25 sets of remains.

    "summary": "Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, penned a letter seeking an expedited inspector general report on the Signal chat leak.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles not manufactured in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

      "A spokesperson for the National Security Council has confirmed that the message thread \"appears to be authentic,\" and none of the reported participants has denied their appearance in the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat. The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee have asked the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to investigate the incident.",
      "So who are the officials whose contacts appear in the Signal chat, and what do they do?",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz",
      "Goldberg said that on Tuesday, March 11, he received a connection request on Signal, from a user identified as Michael Waltz. That turned out to be national security adviser Michael Waltz, a top adviser to the president.",
      "\"Two days later\u2014Thursday\u2014at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group,\" Goldberg wrote. \"It was called the 'Houthi PC small group.'\"",
      "Waltz launched the group's conversation, saying, according to The Atlantic: \"Team \u2013 establishing a principles [sic] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours.\"",
      "As national security adviser, Waltz is a presidential appointee and does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "President Trump told NBC he still has confidence in Waltz, saying, \"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Waltz said\u00a0he took \"full responsibility\" and that he \"built\" the Signal chat group, but he also said he did not have Goldberg's contact information and he didn't know how Goldberg got into the chat. Goldberg said he received a Signal request from a user identified as \"Michael Waltz.\" And soon after, a screenshot Goldberg provided said, \"Michael Waltz added you to the group.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic. Neither the White House nor Hegseth has disputed the authenticity of Hegseth's communication, but they have insisted it doesn't constitute \"war plans.\"",
      "As the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance",
      "Vice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"",
      "Since The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"",
      "As vice president, Vance is not only second in line to the presidency, but a key adviser on virtually all matters of domestic and foreign policy to the president.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"",
      "In his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard",
      "A user called \"TG\" in the Signal chat appears to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, The Atlantic reported. In congressional testimony this week, Gabbard did not deny that she was in the message chain, but she said she was \"not directly involved\" in the part of the chat that discussed attack plans.",
      "As the director of national intelligence, Gabbard is a Cabinet-level head of the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "Gabbard testified Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, where she said Signal came pre-installed on government devices.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff",
      "The name Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, also appears in the chat.",
      "Witkoff was in Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin during part of the period leading up to the attack.",
      "Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that Witkoff didn't have his personal device or government phone with him in Moscow, and that he was given access to a \"classified protected server\" by the U.S. government and was \"very careful\" about his communications while in Russia.",
      "In his own social media post Wednesday, Witkoff said he had \"no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "Witkoff had little communication in the chat.",
      "Scott B.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

      "Atul Patel, a physiatrist in Overland Park, Kansas, and the treasurer of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, said insurers' desire to prevent gratuitous therapy is understandable but has \"gone too far.\"",
      "\"Most patients get way less therapy than they would actually benefit from,\" he said.",
      "Hard caps on rehab endure in part because of an omission in the Affordable Care Act. While that law required insurers to cover rehab and barred them from setting spending restrictions on a patient's medical care, it did not prohibit establishing a maximum number of therapy sessions a year.",
      "More than 29,000 ACA health plans \u2014 nearly 4 in 5 \u2014 limit the annual number of physical therapy sessions, according to a KFF Health News analysis of plans sold last year to individuals and small businesses. Caps generally ranged from 20 to 60 visits; the most common was 20 a year.",
      "Health plans provided by employers often have limits of 20 or 30 sessions as well, said Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries.",
      "\"It's the gross reality in America right now,\" said Sam Porritt, chairman of the Falling Forward Foundation, a Kansas-based philanthropy that has paid for therapy for about 200 patients who exhausted their insurance over the past decade. \"No one knows about this except people in the industry. You find out about it when tragedy hits.\"",
      "Even in plans with no caps, patients are not guaranteed unlimited treatment. Therapists say insurers repeatedly require prior authorization, demanding a new request every two or three visits. Insurers frequently deny additional sessions if they believe there hasn't been improvement.",
      "\"We're seeing a lot of arbitrary denials just to see if you'll appeal,\" said Gwen Simons, a lawyer in Scarborough, Maine, who represents therapy practices. \"That's the point where the therapist throws up their hands.\"",
      "\"Couldn't pick her up\"",
      "Katie Kriegshauser, a 37-year-old psychologist from Kansas City, Missouri, developed pregnancy complications that shut down her liver, pancreas, and kidneys in November 2023. After giving birth to her daughter, she spent more than three months in a hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries and losing more than 40 pounds so quickly that doctors suspected her nerves became damaged from compression. Her neurologist told her he doubted she would ever walk again.",
      "Kriegshauser's UnitedHealthcare insurance plan allowed 30 visits at Ability KC, a rehabilitation clinic in Kansas City. She burned through them in six weeks in 2024 because she needed both physical therapy, to regain her mobility, and occupational therapy, for daily tasks such as getting dressed.",
      "\"At that point I was starting to use the walker from being completely in the wheelchair,\" Kriegshauser recalled. She said she wasn't strong enough to change her daughter's diaper. \"I couldn't pick her up out of her crib or put her down to sleep,\" she said.",
      "The Falling Forward Foundation paid for additional sessions that enabled her to walk independently and hold her daughter in her arms. \"A huge amount of progress happened in that period after my insurance ran out,\" she said.",
      "In an unsigned statement, UnitedHealthcare said it covered the services that were included in Kriegshauser's health plan. The company declined to permit an official to discuss its policies on the record because of security concerns.",
      "A shattered teenager",
      "Patients who need therapy near the start of a health plan's year are more likely to run out of visits. Mari Villar was 15 and had been walking with high school friends to get a bite to eat in May 2023 when a car leaped over a curb and smashed into her before the driver sped away.",
      "The accident broke both her legs, lacerated her liver, damaged her colon, severed an artery in her right leg, and collapsed her lung. She has undergone 11 operations, including emergency exploratory surgery to stop internal bleeding, four angioplasties, and the installation of screws and plates to hold her leg bones together.",
      "Villar spent nearly a month in Shirley Ryan AbilityLab's hospital in Chicago. She was discharged after her mother's insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, denied her physician's request for five more days, making her more reliant on outpatient therapy, according to records shared by her mother, Megan Bracamontes.",
      "Villar began going to one of Shirley Ryan's outpatient clinics, but by the end of 2023, she had used up the 30 physical therapy and 30 occupational therapy visits the Blue Cross plan allowed. Because the plan ran from July to June, she had no sessions left for the first half of 2024.",
      "\"I couldn't do much,\" Villar said. \"I made lots of progress there, but I was still on crutches.\"",
      "Dave Van de Walle, a Blue Cross spokesperson, said in an email that the insurer does not comment on individual cases. Razia Hashmi, vice president for clinical affairs at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a written statement that patients who have run out of sessions should \"explore alternative treatment plans\" including home exercises.",
      "Villar received some extra sessions from the Falling Forward Foundation. While her plan year has reset, Villar is postponing most therapy sessions until after her next surgery so she will be less likely to run out again. Bracamontes said her daughter still can't feel or move her right foot and needs three more operations: one to relieve nerve pain, and two to try to restore mobility in her foot by lengthening her Achilles tendon and transferring a tendon in her left leg into her right.",
      "\"Therapy caps are very unfair because everyone's situation is different,\" Villar said. \"I really depend on my sessions to get me to a new normalcy. And not having that and going through all these procedures is scary to think about.\"",
      "Rationing therapy",
      "Most people who use all their sessions either stop going or pay out-of-pocket for extra therapy.",
      "Amy Paulo, a 34-year-old Massachusetts woman recovering from two operations on her left leg, maxed out the 40 visits covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in 2024, so she spent $1,445 out-of-pocket for 17 therapy sessions.",
      "Paulo needed physical therapy to recover from several surgeries to shorten her left leg to the length of her right leg \u2014 the difference a consequence of juvenile arthritis. Her recovery was prolonged, she said, because her femur didn't heal properly after one of the operations, in which surgeons cut out the middle of her femur and put a rod in its place.",
      "\"I went ballistic on Blue Cross many, many times,\" said Paulo, who works with developmentally delayed children.\"",
      "Amy McHugh, a Blue Cross spokesperson, declined to discuss Paulo's case. In an email, she said most employers who hire Blue Cross to administer their health benefits choose plans with \"our standard\" 60-visit limit, which she said is more generous than most insurers offer, but some employers \"choose to allow for more or fewer visits per year.\"",
      "Paulo said she expects to restrict her therapy sessions to once a week instead of the recommended twice a week because she'll need more help after an upcoming operation on her leg.",
      "\"We had to plan to save my visits for this surgery, as ridiculous as it sounds,\" she said.",
      "Medicare is more generous",
      "People with commercial insurance plans face more hurdles than those on Medicare, which sets dollar thresholds on therapy each year but allows therapists to continue providing services if they document medical necessity. This year the limits are $2,410 for physical and speech therapy and $2,410 for occupational therapy.",
      "Private Medicare Advantage plans don't have visit or dollar caps, but they often require prior authorization every few visits. The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found last year that MA plans deny requests for physical and occupational therapy at hospitals and nursing homes at higher rates than they reject other medical services.",
      "Therapists say many commercial plans require prior authorization and mete out approvals parsimoniously. Insurers often make therapists submit detailed notes, sometimes for each session, documenting patients' treatment plans, goals, and test results showing how well they perform each exercise.",
      "\"It's a battle of getting visits,\" said Jackee Ndwaru, an occupational therapist in Jacksonville, Florida. \"If you can't show progress they're not going to approve.\"",
      "An insurer overruled",
      "Marjorie Haney's insurance plan covered 20 therapy sessions a year, but Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield approved only a few visits at a time for the rotator cuff she tore in a bike accident in Maine. After 13 visits in 2021, Anthem refused to approve more, writing that her medical records \"do not show you made progress with specific daily tasks,\" according to the denial letter.",
      "Haney, a physical therapist herself, said the decision made no sense because at that stage of her recovery, the therapy was focused on preventing her shoulder from freezing up and gradually expanding its range of motion.",
      "\"I went through those visits like they were water,\" Haney, now 57, said. \"My range was getting better, but functionally I couldn't use my arm to lift things.\"",
      "Haney appealed to Maine's insurance bureau for an independent review. In its report overturning Anthem's decision, the bureau's physician consultant, William Barreto, concluded that Haney had made \"substantial improvement\" \u2014 she no longer needed a shoulder sling and was able to return to work with restrictions. Barreto also noted that nothing in Anthem's policy required progress with specific daily tasks, which was the basis for Anthem's refusal.",
      "\"Given the member's substantial restriction in active range of motion and inability to begin strengthening exercises, there is remaining deficit that requires the skills and training of a qualified physical therapist,\" the report said.",
      "Anthem said it requires repeated assessments before authorizing additional visits \"to ensure the member is receiving the right care for the right period of time based on his or her care needs.\" In the statement provided by Stephanie DuBois, an Anthem spokesperson, the insurer said this process \"also helps prevent members from using up all their covered treatment benefits too quickly, especially if they don't end up needing the maximum number of therapy visits.\"",
      "In 2023, Maine passed a law banning prior authorization for the first 12 rehab visits, making it one of the few states to curb insurer limitations on physical therapy. The law doesn't protect residents with plans based in other states or plans from a Maine employer who self-insures.",
      "Haney said after she won her appeal, she spaced out the sessions her plan permitted by going once weekly. \"I got another month,\" she said, \"and I stretched it out to six weeks.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday visited the high-security El Salvador prison where Venezuelans who the Trump administration alleges are gang members have been held since their removal from the United States. The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "An appeals court Wednesday kept in place an order barring the administration from deporting more Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "A central outstanding question about the deportees' status is when and how they could ever be released from the prison, called the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, as they are not serving sentences. They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",
      "They were later shown at the prison kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform \u2014 knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs \u2014 and placed in cells.",
      "For three years, El Salvador has been operating under a state of emergency that suspends fundamental rights as Bukele wages an all-out assault on the country's powerful street gangs. During that time, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties and jailed, often without due process.",
      "Bukele offered to hold U.S. deportees in the prison when Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited in February.",
      "At the prison Wednesday, El Salvador Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro showed Noem a cell holding Salvadorans he said had been there since the prison opened. \"No one expects that these people can go back to society and behave,\" he said.",

      "The three women from Revere, Massachusetts, 23-year-old Kaoutar Naqqad, 24-year-old Imane Mallah and 26-year-old Wafae El-Arar, were found unconscious in their hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in February. Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",
      "Gian Cho, executive director of the National Forensics Science Service, said Wednesday that all three women had carboxyhemoglobin levels higher than 60%. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are typically lower than 2% in nonsmokers and lower than 5% in smokers.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas and is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned.\u00a0 Accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams said that as a result of the findings, authorities have conducted a second test of the hotel room for carbon monoxide poisoning after initial testing showed no signs. Williams said they are still awaiting the final test results.",
      "Authorities also found and tested the alcohol and gummies found in the room. THC was found in one of the items, but no illicit substances were found in the bodies of the three women, Cho said.",

We received it today but needed it throughout this investigative process.\"",

      "The Atlantic said it asked Trump administration officials and the White House if they objected to publishing the messages in light of their denials that the messages contained classified information or \"war plans.\" Most did not respond, and Leavitt told The Atlantic the administration objected to the release, while insisting there was \"no classified information transmitted in the group chat.\"",

    "summary": "Trump has signed an executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandating that all ballots be received by Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive action to overhaul U.S. elections that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections and mandate that all ballots be received by Election Day across the country.",
      "The order claims the U.S. has \"not adequately enforced Federal election requirements,\" citing as examples \"prohibit[ing] States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit[ing] non-citizens from registering to vote.\"",
      "The order says the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protections\" and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. The president also threatened to pull federal funding from states where election officials are not in compliance.",
      "David Becker, the CEO of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, characterized the order as a \"federal takeover of the constitutional authority of local and state governments to run elections.\" He said it \"seeks to seize authority over election technology and processes at the state and local level ... all while bypassing congressional approval.\"",
      "If implemented, it could cost state taxpayers tens of billions, he predicted, though Becker, who is a CBS News election law contributor, also expects the executive order to face a difficult road in the courts.",
      "While Congress has the power to regulate voting \u2014 and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" for elections.",
      "Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an \"unlawful\" weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is \"trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.\" And Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order \"is not just misguided \u2014 it is immoral and illegal.\"",
      "The executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies, like the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, provide election support. The commission distributes grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.",
      "In 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew\u00a0complaints from Republicans\u00a0who called it federal overreach. Mr. Trump rescinded that order.",
      "Mr. Trump's order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity. It states that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. The order also advises the commission to condition funding to states on these new guidelines.",
      "Virtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.",
      "It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Mr. Trump for the executive order, calling it a \"great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.\"",
      "Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a \"welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.\"",
      "At least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump's ire, said in a social media post, \"This will not stand. We will sue.\"",
      "The president has long claimed elections were being rigged, even before the results were known. He's battled certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, falsely blaming\u00a0widespread fraud for his loss.",
      "Mr. Trump said more election actions would be taken in the coming weeks.",

    "summary": "President Trump's plan to impose new tariffs on U.S. car imports dented stocks, with more levies set to take effect April 2.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks skidded in afternoon trading after the White House signaled that President Trump on Wednesday would announce more tariffs, with the latest salvo targeting U.S. auto imports.",
      "The S&P 500 dropped 64 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,712, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite nosed down 2% as investors pulled back from major technology players.",
      "After a delayed announcement, Mr. Trump said he is imposing a 25% tariff on all vehicles imported into the U.S. \"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" he said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.",
      "Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated.",
      "Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies. The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors.",
      "He added, \"Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve earlier this month cited the likely impact of tariffs in\u00a0lowering its outlook for U.S. economic growth to 1.7%, while also forecasting a pickup in inflation.",
      "A new analysis by Oxford Economics found that U.S. tariffs could raise the cost of some products by as much as 4%, with home appliances, musical instruments, tableware and utensils, and personal care items potentially seeing the biggest price hikes.",

    "summary": "President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u200b to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members kicked off a legal battle.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld by a federal appeals court on March 26. A White House spokesperson said it plans to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, who temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, has questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese decent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

      "The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency is no longer publishing details of canceled U.S. Agency for International Development contracts due to what's described as \"legal reason[s]\" on its website.",
      "The change is \"related to ongoing litigation,\" a White House administration official told CBS News. It is not clear which litigation challenging the dismantling of USAID caused DOGE to remove information about canceled contracts from its \"Wall of Receipts\" site. The official did not respond when asked for more information.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the 3,214 USAID contracts listed on DOGE's website contain no information other than the total contract value and the amount DOGE claims to have saved by canceling them. The canceled USAID contracts represent about 45% of the total number of itemized contracts on DOGE's website, and 57% of the $21.6 billion it claims to have saved from terminated contracts.",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that DOGE likely violated the constitution when it acted to shutter USAID. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents DOGE from taking further action related to the shutdown of USAID.",
      "The USAID contracts alone total $12.4 billion in alleged savings, though multiple experts in federal contracting have said the method DOGE is using to calculate savings is flawed. DOGE uses the total potential value of a contract, which is often far higher than the actual amount an agency ends up spending, to estimate savings. The actual amount of funding cut as a result of USAID contract terminations is closer to $6.7 billion as of Tuesday, according to an analysis by former USAID data analyst Brian Banks.",
      "Multiple news outlets, including CBS News, have also identified errors in DOGE's accounting, with some contracts being double or triple counted. Many of the original errors have been removed but it's not clear if they are still included in the total $103 billion DOGE has claimed to have saved.",
      "DOGE, led by billionaire and President Trump's senior advisor Elon Musk, originally touted the list of canceled contracts as evidence of increased transparency.",
      "\"We're very public with what we do,\" Musk said in an interview with Ted Cruz on March 17. \"I don't know how we could be more transparent. Literally every action that we do, small or large, we post on the DOGE.gov website.\"",
      "With the removal of the USAID contract details, it's unclear what international aid programs the task force is ending.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of over 5,000 terminated USAID grants, awards and contracts, up to date as of March 12. The cancellations included at least $1.39 billion in efforts to fight disease and support global health, including $1.1 billion in fighting malaria. The terminated contracts also included at least $171.7 million in programs providing access to food and clean water and $435.2 million in efforts to provide access to education abroad.",

Stefanik has not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",

These planes had multiple machine guns, held over 20,000 pounds of bombs and were especially suited to fly to Japan from bases in China during World War II, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.",
      "Hodak's plane was shot down while on a mission to Tokyo. He was initially reported as missing in action, the DPAA said, but investigators learned he had been captured after the plane was taken down. He was taken to the Tokyo Military Prison.",
      "In late May 1945, U.S. aircraft heavily bombed Tokyo, causing huge fires and burning hundreds of structures, according to Military.com. One of the destroyed buildings was the Tokyo Military Prison. Hodak was among the service members being held there at the time. None of the people imprisoned at the facility survived the blaze, Military.com reported. They were buried in a mass grave.",
      "The American Graves Registration Service disinterred 65 sets of remains from the prison in early 1946, after World War II ended. The service was able to identify 25 sets of remains. One was a Japanese person, the DPAA said. The 39 unidentified sets of remains were interred as Unknowns at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",

According to data from Japan's coast guard, Chinese government vessels entered the maritime zone around the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, on 355 of the 366 days of 2024 \u2014 the highest number of intrusions reported by Japan since China started operating around the islands in 2008.",
      "The Chinese vessels operating around the islands have increased not only in number, but in armament, carrying more and larger weapons as they circle the disputed territories, according to officials at the foreign and defense ministries.",
      "While Japanese analysts don't believe a Chinese military invasion of the Senkaku islands is imminent, they say there's a risk that an accident or incident involving fishing or other non-military vessels in the area could lead to a rapid military escalation.",
      "\"The Chinese Communist Party believes in power. They have started to act because they believe they now have the power to do so,\" China expert Akio Takahara, a professor at the Tokyo Woman's Christian University, told CBS News. \"We want the U.S. to increase their presence in this region, because the Chinese are certainly going to enhance their presence in the region.\"",
      "Major boost to U.S.-Japan defense cooperation coming?",
      "Japan has revamped its approach to defense in recent years, including by committing to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027. Japan announced a major policy shift in 2022, abandoning the country's post-World War II, exclusively defense posture with a decision to acquire counterstrike capabilities.",
      "The Trump administration has seemingly approved of the changes, and it has not asked Japan for even greater increases in defense spending as some Japanese officials feared it might.",
      "While Mr. Trump complained specifically this month about Japan's hypothetical preparedness to meet its mutual defense obligation to the U.S. under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Japanese officials have tried to focus more on Article 6, under which Japan provides bases and facilities for U.S. forces. And that aspect of the relationship could be set to expand.",
      "The U.S. and Japan have been in discussions since before Mr. Trump came back to the White House about the possible establishment of a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan. If it happens, it would upgrade the role of the U.S. forces in Japan to a command headquarters with operational authority. The dialogue over the upgrade was announced under the Biden administration, after being requested by the Japanese.",
      "In the event of a regional security crisis \u2014 such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a disputed South China Sea island \u2014 having a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan would give the U.S. military the capacity to respond with commands from the region, rather than waiting for orders to come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to meet with his Japanese counterpart in late March to discuss efforts to bolster U.S. forces in the Pacific region.",
      "Concern over Ukraine",
      "The dramatic vacillations by the Trump administration in its stance on Ukraine have also raised concern in Japan. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Japan has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Japanese officials worry about the precedent that would be set if the U.S. is seen to abandon a partner nation in the face of an invasion by a more powerful neighbor.",
      "\"In light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, countries' perceptions on security have drastically changed around the world,\" then-Japanese Prime minister Fumio Kishida said at a regional security summit In June 2022, several months into Russia's invasion. \"I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.\"",
      "The Japanese fear that if the U.S. and the world at large are prepared to accept a change in Europe's borders forced by Russian aggression, they could also decline to intervene in the case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "\"The Chinese will be encouraged that, perhaps if Xi Jinping did something similar, Trump will be as kind to Xi Jinping as he's been to Putin,\" professor Takahara told CBS News. \"That kind of message will be received in Beijing.\"",
      "Officials in Tokyo are trying to remain focused on the long-term bilateral relationship with Washington, looking beyond the Trump administration, but they know China is watching closely as the relationship develops, especially given the volatile nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "\"We don't know what Mr. Trump will be saying tomorrow and doing the day after. So, at least the Ishiba visit, the first round, went okay. We were happy about that,\" Takahara said. \"But what about the next round? When is it coming? No one knows.\"",

    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026.\u00a0The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",

Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",

    "story": [
      "The editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, has nothing to say about his relationship with national security adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently added him to a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Yemen days ago.",
      "\"I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz,\" Goldberg told CBS News in an interview Wednesday.",
      "Waltz claimed he has \"never met\" with Goldberg, wouldn't be able to pick him out of a police lineup and trashed his reputation, calling him \"the bottom scum of journalists.\" But photos surfaced online earlier Wednesday of the two together at an event at the French Embassy in 2021.",
      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

    "summary": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe returned to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after\u00a0more text messages came to light\u00a0and revealed new details about what was shared.",
      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",
      "In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has \"no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride.\"",

    "story": [
      "Second lady Usha Vance will visit Greenland later this week, the White House announced Sunday, before Vice President JD Vance announced days later that he would be joining his wife on the visit.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz was set to make a separate trip this week as the\u00a0Trump administration continues to eye Greenland. Waltz had been expected to visit the Pituffik Space Base, a source familiar with the plans told CBS News on Sunday. The vice president's office said after Vance's announcement on Tuesday that the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members. The base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut that had previously been announced.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Monday that the U.S. has a \"vested interested in the Arctic region.\"",
      "\"We also look forward to experiencing Greenland's famous hospitality and are confident that this visit presents an opportunity to build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation,\" Hughes said. \"This is a visit to learn about Greenland, its culture, history, and people and to attend a dogsled race the United States is proud to sponsor, plain and simple.\"",
      "The plans were criticized Monday by Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who said Washington was interfering in Greenland's internal affairs, according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "\"It should be said clearly that our integrity and democracy must be respected without foreign interference,\" AFP quoted Egede as saying, adding that it \"cannot be seen as just a private visit.\"",
      "The vice president said in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted to social media Tuesday that \"there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "The second lady has already made a number of overseas trips, having visited Paris in February and India earlier this month. The White House said Sunday that Usha Vance would be joined by her son and a U.S. delegation.",
      "President Trump first expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, which is currently a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, during his first administration. He has ramped up the effort since taking office two months ago. In his first speech before a joint session of Congress of his second term, Mr. Trump vowed that \"we're going to get it.\"",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address on March 4. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Egede responded at the time, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "Egede said Mr. Trump was, \"very unpredictable, in such a way that people feel insecure.\" In an election that was held on March 11 \u2014 after Mr. Trump's speech \u00a0\u2014 Egede's opposition won, although the party still needs to form a coalition government.",
      "\"Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside,\" Democratic party leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen told local media, according to BBC News. \"There is a need for unity, so we will enter into negotiations with everyone.\"",
      "Waltz said in January that the talks about Greenland are \"not just about Greenland, this is about the Arctic.\"",
      "\"You have Russia that is trying to become king of the Arctic with 60 plus icebreakers, some of them nuclear powered,\" Waltz said in January. \"You know how many we have? We have two and one just caught on fire. This is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's son,\u00a0Donald Trump Jr., visited in January before the president took office. Ahead of his visit, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that Greenland is not for sale, but she said she would continue to welcome American interest and investment.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continues to insist it didn't defy a federal judge's order when it failed to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order blocking the deportations of alleged gang members who hadn't been afforded due process. It's a case that's become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and federal courts.",
      "In a 14-page document\u00a0filed late Tuesday night, the Justice Department spelled out before Boasberg why it didn't turn around the two flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members despite his verbal order to do so.",
      "\"These removals both complied with the law and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. The Government will continue to defend the removals before this Court and, if necessary, on appeal challenging this Court's two injunctions issued on March 15,\" the filing reads. It's signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior DOJ officials.",
      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. The law has only been invoked three times throughout American history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's assertions that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She's the one who didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, also an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\"\u00a0the judge wrote.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",

      "\"It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,\" Ratcliffe said. \"My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",

      "The spy chiefs also denied that the conversation included information on weapons packages, targets or timing of the strikes, as Goldberg reported.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ratcliffe said, with Gabbard adding \"same answer.\"",
      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",
      "Gabbard told Wyden she had \"no objection\" to cooperating with an audit to confirm such, while Ratcliffe said he would comply with any follow up that the National Security Council deemed appropriate.",
      "Another heated moment came during the back and forth between Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and Ratcliffe. Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment,\" Bennet said. \"You need to do better.\"",

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance said he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.",
      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

      "Russia and Ukraine have agreed to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,\" the Trump administration said Tuesday, claiming a limited advance in efforts to broker a peace deal between the two countries.",
      "The agreements were announced in separate statements by the White House after U.S. officials held separate bilateral talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",

    "summary": "The National Security Council said the message thread \"appears to be authentic\" and the administration is \"reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A number of lawmakers expressed outrage Monday after the editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a group chat\u00a0involving top Trump administration officials about the United States' highly sensitive war plans in Yemen.",
      "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. It is likely to become a topic of questioning as leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to testify about global security threats facing the country.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen.",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately,\" Reed's statement said.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It's definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made.\"",
      "\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it.",
      "In a\u00a0piece\u00a0published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",
      "The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.",
      "The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"",
      "Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"",
      "He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",
      "Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.",
      "Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",
      "\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"",
      "\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",
      "Johnson added that he didn't think Waltz, who apparently started the group chat and included the journalist, according to Goldberg's report, should be disciplined.",

    "summary": "President Trump says the U.S. needs control of Greenland and the Panama Canal \"for national security.\" Here's why both places are so important.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump repeated vows to secure U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal in his speech to a joint a session of Congress\u00a0on March 4.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Greenland's prime minister responded, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "Now, Vice President JD Vance and second lady\u00a0Usha Vance\u00a0are expected to visit Greenland this week, according to the White House.\u00a0Donald Trump Jr. visited in January\u00a0before the president took office.",
      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Inside the Vances' Greenland visit",
      "Usha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo as part of an expanded cultural trip, but on Tuesday, March 25, the vice president announced he would join her. The two are expected to travel to the country on Friday and spend time at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.",
      "The Vances are expected to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with service members at the base.",
      "While announcing his visit, Vance didn't mention Mr. Trump's hopes to acquire the northern country, but said that the \"really important\" nation has been threatened by other countries.",
      "\"A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there,\" Vance said in a video announcing his visit.",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he added. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "A\u00a0recent poll showed\u00a0that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

    "summary": "South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, but didn't rule on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's Constitutional Court on Monday overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader, while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "Many observers said Monday's ruling doesn't signal much on the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn't a key figure in Yoon's martial law imposition. But it could still embolden Yoon's staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Han became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly over his Dec. 3 imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis. But Han was impeached by the assembly as well in late December following political strife with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified a domestic division and deepened worries about the country's diplomatic and economic activities. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, had since serving as acting president.",
      "On Monday, seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.",
      "Dismissing Han would have needed the support of at least six court justices.",
      "Following his reinstatement, Han told reporters he would focus on the \"most urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. He also called for a national unity, saying \"there's no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",
      "The court has yet to rule on Yoon's impeachment. If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a election for a new president. If it rules for him, Yoon will be restored to office and regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon was impeached about two weeks earlier than Han. Observers earlier predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March but it hasn't done so.",
      "Yoon has been separately arrested and charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. If convicted of that charge, he would face the death penalty or a life sentence. On March 8, Yoon was released from prison, after a Seoul district court allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "At the center of squabbling over Yoon is why he sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he aims to maintain order, but senior military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down unanimously.",
      "Han, a career diplomat who was appointed by Yoon, had attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets, when he served as acting president. A major trigger for the opposition's push for his impeachment was Han's refusal to fill three vacancies on the nine-member Constitutional Court bench.",
      "Restoring the court's full membership was sensitive because a ruling upholding Yoon's impeachment requires support from at least six justices.",
      "Han's successor, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Both Han and Choi cited needing bipartisan consent to add justices to the court, but their critics suspected they were siding with Yoon's People Power Party, which wanted to increase Yoon's chances of returning to power. On Friday, the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion on Choi.",

      "Maduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.",

      "\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",

Say, a three-month run or two-month run, the Kennedy Center, and then you bring it to Broadway and give the Kennedy Center a piece of those profits. Maybe there's a[n] economic model that makes sense and something that is publicly supported a bit to help these producers take risks, mount things that will actually resonate with audiences. Find different genres that perhaps they haven't explored before.\"",

And when something happens on that stage, everybody's reacting. It's live, it's electric. It's different from watching in a movie theater or watching from home. That like what we're having now.

      "Ben Affleck set the record straight on the \"root causes\" of his divorce from Jennifer Lopez.",
      "Affleck and Lopez finalized their divorce in January, roughly two years after getting married at the actor's Georgia estate. The \"Argo\" star noted that while people have speculated about the issues that led to his divorce from JLo, the real reason is much more ordinary than anyone might believe. Affleck and Lopez's different approaches to fame have been mentioned as the cause of their split after the premiere of Lopez' documentary, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" but the \"Air\" director emphasized it \"wasn't the cause of some major fracture.\"",
      "\"Part of it was, \u2018OK, if I\u2019m going to participate in this, I want to try to do it in an honest way and in a way that\u2019s interesting.\u2019 Because I thought it was an interesting examination,\" Affleck explained in a cover story for GQ magazine. \"There are a lot of people who I think have handled celebrity more adeptly and more adroitly than I have, Jennifer among them.",
      "\"My temperament is to be a little bit more reserved and private than hers. As happens in relationships, you don\u2019t always have the same attitude towards these things. And so I thought, 'Oh, this is interesting, because how do you reconcile that?",

      "\"I love and support this person. I believe in them. They\u2019re great. I want people to see that,\" he continued. \"And I think the thing that I said in that documentary or the piece that they used was where I said, \u2018You don\u2019t marry a ship captain and then say, 'Well, I don\u2019t like going out in the water.\u2019 You\u2019ve got to own what you knew going into any relationship. And I think it\u2019s important to say that wasn\u2019t the cause of some major fracture. It\u2019s not like you can watch that documentary and go, \u2018Oh, now I understand the issues that these two had.\u2019\"",
      "The actor later shared that there was no big moment that brought their marriage to an end.",
      "\"I have nothing but respect [for Lopez]. I guess there\u2019s a tendency to look at breakups and want to identify root causes or something. But, honestly, like I said, the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting.\"",

And as you get older, this is true for me. I assume it\u2019s true for most people. There is no \u2018So-and-so did this\u2019 or \u2018This was the big event.\u2019 It\u2019s really, it sounds more like a couple\u2019s therapy session, which you would tune out of someone else\u2019s couple\u2019s therapy after a while.",
      "\"For one thing, you start going, \u2018OK, clearly this person has got these issues. Clearly, they have these issues.\u2019 And the reason I don\u2019t want to share that is just sort of embarrassing. It feels vulnerable.\"",

      "\"I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s absurd, and it\u2019s ridiculous,\" he told the outlet. \"There\u2019s nothing newsworthy at all about the day-to-day events of my life or the conversation I have with one person or another person that\u2019s photographed.",

Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag. If an email pressures you into clicking a link, verify it first.",

      "5) Request data deletion: If you no longer wish for your data to be stored by 23andMe, request its deletion through your account settings. Ensure you also ask for the destruction of any physical samples.",
      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach. Enable two-factor authentication wherever it\u2019s offered to add an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\u00a0Check out my best expert-reviewed password managers for 2025 here.",
      "7) Monitor for suspicious activity and use identity theft protection: Genetic data leaks can lead to identity theft or medical fraud. Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks.

But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",

However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations.

      "The recent arrest of Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu and main rival of President Erdo\u011fan has sparked the largest protests in Turkey in a decade, with over 1,100 people detained in demonstrations across the country.",
      "The Istanbul mayor and 106 other municipal officials and politicians were detained on March 19 for what Human Rights Watch called a politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities.",
      "\"By forcing Imamoglu out of politics, the government has crossed the line that separates Turkey\u2019s competitive authoritarian regime from a full, Russian-style autocracy in which the president handpicks his opponents and elections are purely for show,\" Gonul Tol, Director of Turkish Program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital.",

Yerlikaya also alleged that weapons were seized during the protests and the individuals detained were found to have ties to different terrorist organizations and prior criminal records.",

      "The opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) held a symbolic primary vote over the weekend and nominated \u0130mamo\u011flu to be the party\u2019s candidate for president to face Erdo\u011fan in the 2028 elections.",

      "Uzgel said Erdo\u011fan seems frightened of losing power, and is urging opposition supporters to take to the streets to defend democracy, challenge lawlessness, and challenge the Erdo\u011fan government's abuse of power.",
      "\"We are happy to see that our people take to the streets despite the occasional use of force by the riot police, and demonstrate peacefully, which is a constitutional right,\" he added.",
      "Imamoglu, who is presently jailed and is awaiting trial on corruption charges, was viewed as the most serious challenger to the decades-long rule of Erdo\u011fan. His detention will likely keep him out of the political opposition for the foreseeable future, dealing a huge blow to Turkey\u2019s pro-democracy movement.",
      "Tol of the Middle East Institute said Erdo\u011fan is banking on people\u2019s anger dissipating over time and that the mass protests will eventually die down. The election is not scheduled until 2028, and people, Erdo\u011fan hopes, will most likely forget and move on.",

      "\u0130mamo\u011flu, member of the secular Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019 and re-elected in 2023. In both elections, he defeated Erdo\u011fan-backed opponents.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday it plans to cut 10,000 full-time jobs across several agencies, as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restructure many parts of the federal government.",
      "The cuts, part of the White House\u2019s \u201creduction in force\u201d plan, were expected to effectively shutter or downsize multiple departments at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies, potentially jeopardizing public health efforts.",
      "HHS oversees 13 agencies, including the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "HHS said Thursday that 28 divisions in the health department contain \u201credundant units,\u201d and that the restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 divisions.",
      "\u201cWe will eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments, while preserving their core functions by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for Healthy America or AHA,\u201d HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a post on X.",
      "Among the agencies set to be folded into the Administration for Healthy America include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, which includes a program focused on HIV treatment.",
      "Among the divisions being eliminated or reduced at the CDC, HHS said, are those focused on global health, domestic HIV prevention and prevention from injury, such as gun violence.",
      "In total, the CDC will decrease its workforce by about 2,400 employees, said Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for HHS. The administration will also move the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which manages the nation's emergency stockpile, from HHS to the CDC, he said.",
      "The administration will also make cuts to divisions at other agencies tasked with responding to approving new drugs, providing health insurance and responding to infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "The FDA will decrease its workforce by about 3,500 full-time employees; the NIH headcount will be reduced by 1,200 employees; and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will lose about 300 workers.",
      "Overall, the cuts will shrink the health department's full-time workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 when combined with its earlier layoffs.",
      "According to a memo obtained by NBC News, employees will be notified on whether they've been laid off as early as Friday.",
      "Nixon said the reorganization of CMS will not impact Medicare and Medicaid services, nor will it affect the timeline for the FDA's review of drugs, medical devices and food.",
      "He added that \"no additional cuts are currently planned.\"",
      "Larry Levitt, executive vice president of health policy at KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues, said government agencies tend to sprawl over time and benefit from occasional reorganization, but he criticized the Trump administration's approach.",
      "\"This is not just a reorganization of HHS,\" he said. \"It's also a slashing of the federal workforce, which will ultimately affect government services. People and health care providers may find themselves waiting longer to get help and get their questions answered, and that will cause frustration and delays in services.\"",
      "An FDA employee who received notice of the agency's planned cuts Thursday morning worried that reviews of medical products including drugs and devices could be delayed, despite the administration's assurances.",
      "\"The cuts to FDA will still adversely affect our mission, it doesn't matter if they're not directly cutting reviewers,\" said the employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of repercussions. \"We're only able to review because of a lot of back end support.\"",
      "Thursday's cuts were separate from earlier attempts by government officials to fire thousands of probationary employees at the CDC and other federal agencies. Two federal judges have since ordered the temporary reinstatement of many of those affected workers.",
      "Leadership at the CDC was given notice of the plans Wednesday and were told to expect an announcement Thursday or Friday, according to an agency worker who was not authorized to speak on the matter.",
      "Federal health officials had previously said they planned to shift responsibilities from some eliminated departments to other parts of HHS.",
      "For example, the Trump administration was considering a plan to move the responsibilities of the CDC\u2019s Division of HIV Prevention over to the Health Resources and Services Administration, which does its own HIV work under The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "However, HRSA is primarily focused on the treatment of HIV rather than preventing it, leaving some HIV advocates concerned it could drive back progress on prevention.",
      "It was unclear Thursday whether that was still the administration's plan. A spokesperson for HHS did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Much of the responsibility for the newly downsized agencies at the CDC will likely be left to Susan Monarez, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the agency and its current acting director.",
      "Earlier this month, The Associated Press reported that five CDC division leaders resigned as the agency prepared for cuts.",
      "On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Dr. Marty Makary, a pancreatic surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, to lead the FDA and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor of medicine\u00a0to lead the NIH.",
      "A senate committee Tuesday voted to advance former surgeon and TV personality Dr. Mehmet Oz's nomination to lead the CMS."

    "summary": "Faced with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown and Columbia University's concessions, students say protesting simply isn\u2019t worth the risk.",
    "story": [
      "The protests at Columbia University last spring were dogged: Students galvanized by the war in Gaza staged demonstrations for weeks on end, erected tent cities on campus lawns and annexed a university building.",
      "But nearly a year later, as the university again finds itself at the center of unprecedented controversy, the student revolt that captivated the world appears to be largely absent.",
      "Students say that amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on international student protesters, the harsh punishment of some of last year\u2019s participants and the university's new rules restricting campus demonstrations, speaking out simply isn\u2019t worth the risk.",
      "A freshman Columbia engineering student said\u00a0he felt \u201cproud\u201d last year as he watched the protests from his home in Texas. But the student, who asked NBC News not to publish his name because of the sensitivity around the war in Gaza, said that while he\u2019d like to join protests this year, he won\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, frankly,\u201d the 18-year-old student said. \u201cNot every family of the people that will go out to protest have the financial capabilities to be able to afford a lawyer in the event that you\u2019re pressed charges.\u201d",
      "Sebastian Javadpoor, a senior who leads the university\u2019s student-led Democratic club, agreed. Students are avoiding protests by choice, he said: \u201cYou have students who are not participating in protests because they\u2019re terrified.\u201d",
      "On March 8, immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests last year. Khalil, who was born in Syria and is of Palestinian descent, was living in university housing on a student visa with his American wife, who is eight months pregnant.",
      "In the days that followed, another one of the university\u2019s international students was arrested and a third fled to Canada, according to the Department of Homeland Security. And on Monday, a fourth student who has lived in the country since she was 7 years old sued the Trump administration after, she said, immigration authorities tried to deport her.\u00a0The crackdown goes far beyond Columbia. In recent days, immigration authorities have arrested students at Georgetown University, Tufts University and the University of Alabama. NBC News obtained a video of authorities detaining Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts student, on Tuesday. It hows several Department of Homeland Security officers in plainclothes surrounding Ozturk, a Turkish national, grabbing her hands and taking her away as she screamed out in confusion.",
      "Last Friday, threatened by the Trump administration with the loss of $400 million in federal research grants for \u201cinaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\u201d the university acquiesced to sweeping changes.",
      "Columbia agreed to ban masks at protests in most cases, enlist 36 new campus security officers \u2014 who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students \u2014 and hire a senior vice provost to oversee the Department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies, according to a document the university said it shared with the federal government and posted on its website Friday.",
      "But students and faculty members protested the arrests and the changes in policy only a handful of times in recent weeks.",
      "Unlike the sprawling demonstrations last year, a student protest on March 14 was confined to a small, tight space outside the university gates. It was surrounded by police barricades and lasted just a few hours.",
      "On Monday, a few dozen faculty members held a vigil for democracy, which also took place off campus. A student activist group also encouraged students to sit out of classes and wear masks in defiance of the partial ban. Yet the response was muted, students said.\u00a0Most of the dozens of students NBC News approached in recent weeks declined to speak on the record. Many said they feared speaking out would get them in trouble with the university. (Earlier this month, the university announced that it suspended or expelled some of the students who participated in the takeover of Hamilton Hall last year.)",
      "Others said they feared that voicing their opinions would draw the ire of federal authorities. And some said they were simply fatigued by the controversies engulfing the university.",
      "Allie Wong, a Ph.D. student who was arrested while protesting on campus in April, said the Trump administration\u2019s actions and the university\u2019s response have had a \u201ctremendous chilling effect\u201d on a campus known for challenging authority.",
      "In 1968, Columbia students similarly took over Hamilton Hall to protest the U.S. government\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War, prompting more than 700 arrests. Not including last year, students blockaded or occupied the university academic building again at least four more times since then, according to the university\u2019s website.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this pride that this is the epicenter of constructive dialogue and social change,\u201d Wong said.",
      "But things are different now, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that people get arrested during protests,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is uncommon that in the aftermath of protests, a year later, that the president of the United States is going through and actively targeting individuals to make a spectacle out of it.\u201d\u00a0A Justice Department spokesperson said the department \u201cmakes no apologies for its efforts to defend President Trump\u2019s agenda in court and protect Jewish Americans from vile antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said the pressure put on Columbia by the federal government is an attempt to bring universities \u201cto heel\u201d and poses grave First Amendment concerns for other schools.",
      "\u201cThe goal is not just to chill that kind of speech at Columbia, but to chill it everywhere,\u201d Wizner said, \u201cand to communicate to every university, public and private, that if you don\u2019t engage in these kinds of crackdowns on your own, we\u2019re going to impose them with the threat of crippling funding cuts.\u201d",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in interviews this week that there was no timetable to restore the university\u2019s funding but that Columbia was \u201con the right track.\u201d",
      "A Columbia spokesperson said in a statement that the university intends to combat antisemitism while protecting free expression.\u00a0\u201cWe respect that there will be vigorous debate on campus about issues of academic freedom and protest, and we welcome that debate,\u201d it said.",
      "In a statement this week, Dr. Katrina Armstrong, the university\u2019s interim president, reiterated her commitment to \u201cseeing these changes implemented with the full support of Columbia\u2019s senior leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny suggestion that these measures are illusory, or lack my personal support, is unequivocally false,\u201d she wrote \u201cThese changes are real, and they are right for Columbia.\u201d",
      "Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Columbia didn\u2019t push back against the administration\u2019s demands. The AAUP, which defends the rights of faculty, sued several federal agencies Monday, arguing that the actions violated the professors\u2019 right to free speech.",
      "If the university won\u2019t \u201cstand up and fight back\u201d against government incursions, he said, \u201cthen it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t have the kind of higher education which has been the engine of this country\u2019s economy and democracy for the last 100 years.\u201d",
      "Michael Thaddeus, a professor of mathematics at Columbia who joined Monday's protest, said the mood among the faculty is \u201cprofound alarm and dismay.\u201d",
      "Still, to an outsider, life on campus might appear status quo, he said.",
      "\u201cClasses are continuing, athletic competition is continuing, the libraries are open. I was watching a campus tour go by outside,\u201d said Thaddeus. \u201cIt\u2019s just a weird combination of normal and very abnormal.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Measles vaccination rates for young children may be far lower than publicly reported, a troubling development that could mean the United States is closer than expected to losing its \u201celimination status\u201d for the extremely contagious disease.",
      "\u201cWe are experiencing an extremely concerning decline in measles vaccination in the very group most vulnerable to the disease,\u201d said Benjamin Rader, a computational epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and the author of a recent study that looked at children\u2019s vaccination rates.",
      "As of Wednesday, there have been over 420 cases of measles this year \u2013 already surpassing the total number of cases for 2024. Most are in West Texas, where a growing outbreak has spread into neighboring states, but a handful of cases, linked to international travel, have been reported in other states. The cases have mostly been in unvaccinated people or those with an unknown vaccination status, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, so pockets of under-vaccinated areas can make it easier to gain a foothold and spread, Rader said.",
      "\u201cThe worry is that once measles gains a foothold in the community, it\u2019ll transition from isolated outbreaks to an endemic disease,\u201d with consistent presence in the U.S., he said.",
      "\u2018Sampling bias\u2019",
      "The CDC recommends two doses of MMR vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second shot at ages 4 to 6 years before entering school. The agency estimates 92.7% of kindergarteners have had two doses of the vaccine.",
      "That\u2019s not high enough, said Dr. Brian Clista, a pediatrician who works in private practice in Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cThe 92% vaccination status reported by the CDC is still below the recommended rate of 95% to produce herd immunity \u2014 so it\u2019s not where we need to be,\u201d Clista said.",
      "However, Rader said that the true MMR vaccination rate among young children can be misrepresented by publicly reported numbers, because MMR surveillance is drawn from older children who are already in kindergarten.",
      "Younger children under the age of 5 are not fully captured in surveillance data because they have not reached kindergarten age \u2014 although a 2021 estimate from the CDC notes a subset of younger children, namely those who received at least one MMR dose by 24 months, were 90.6% vaccinated for measles.",
      "In Rader\u2019s study, published online in February in the American Journal of Public Health, his team surveyed approximately 20,000 parents of children under 5 from July 2023 through April 2024, finding only 71.8% reported that their children received at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine \u2014 much lower than CDC estimates.",
      "The researchers used a digital surveillance platform that the CDC has used to estimate things like at-home Covid testing, he said.",
      "Rader downplayed the difference in numbers between his findings and the CDC data, emphasizing that, while accurate, the CDC data does not provide a complete picture \u2014 despite its best intentions.",
      "Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not part of the research, called the findings \u201cworrisome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was likely exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, especially because, as Rader notes, many kids catch up on the childhood vaccine schedule when they enter elementary school and the school requires it,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "He agreed with the findings that the true rate is lower than what the CDC reports, likely due to a \u201csampling bias.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith greater homeschooling and greater schooling absences, as occurred during Covid, the more likely there will be more of these kids who do not get the chance to catch up on the childhood vaccines,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Clista noted that the study has limitations, as the research relied on parents self-reporting information compared to more objective data that the CDC gathers from kindergarten entry forms.",
      "Rader acknowledged that not every child younger than 5 is eligible for the measles vaccine, and his study didn\u2019t specify the exact ages of the children younger than 5 who were unvaccinated.",
      "The pandemic exacerbated vaccine hesitancy",
      "The pandemic disrupted health care access, which made it harder for people to get routine care and increased vaccine hesitancy over the Covid vaccine, which also spilled over and affected MMR vaccine rates, Rader said.",
      "The study found 20% more children were vaccinated for measles when their parents were vaccinated for Covid.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, routine vaccination is trending substantially lower, although there is the hope that it will catch up,\u201d Rader said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock \u2014 the largest city in West Texas, where the current outbreak is centered \u2014 said school enrollment requirements should help many children catch up as they enter pre-K or kindergarten.",
      "\u201cHowever, in Texas, we\u2019re seeing a growing number of parents opting out of vaccinations \u2014 a troubling trend that puts communities at greater risk,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2018We\u2019re headed in that direction\u2019",
      "Measles has been \u201celiminated\u201d in the U.S. since 2000 \u2014 meaning that the country hasn\u2019t had a chain of transmission extend for more than 52 weeks.",
      "\u201cWith the absence of sustained measles virus transmission for 12 consecutive months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system, the United States has maintained measles elimination status since 2000,\u201d a CDC spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis temporal boundary, however, was nearly breached in 2019,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Temte, professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. Temte was part of the team who declared measles eliminated in 2000.",
      "When he served on a panel to recertify measles elimination in 2011-12, one of his greatest concerns, he said, was the rising rates of vaccine exemptions among children and the cases brought into the U.S. after international travel that could lead to endemic transmission.",
      "Now additional factors might be creating a perfect storm for the U.S. to lose its elimination status, including declining vaccination rates, increasing pockets of unvaccinated individuals and greater ease in travel.",
      "I would guess that the likelihood of re-establishment of measles in the United States is greater than 50%.",
      "Measles is also contagious before its characteristic rash appears, often creating a delay in diagnosis and allowing it to spread before people know they are infected.",
      "Combining this with the level of complacency toward the public health response and the lack of recognition that an illness from measles can be serious, Temte said, \u201cI would guess that the likelihood of re-establishment of measles in the United States is greater than 50%.\u201d",
      "Other experts are also concerned.",
      "\u201cI believe we\u2019re headed in that direction,\u201d Wells said. \u201cI can\u2019t say for certain whether this will be the outbreak that causes it, but if we don\u2019t take steps to increase vaccination rates nationwide, we will lose our measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Dr. Michael Mina, vaccine expert and epidemiologist, whose research was the first to discover that measles can wipe out the immune system\u2019s memory of previous illnesses, said he expected cases to continue almost exclusively among the unvaccinated.",
      "\u201cWhile we do have very many unvaccinated children, whether the virus burns through most of the susceptible or is slower and drives some level of endemicity is tough to say,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cMy concern is the \u2018bubbles\u2019 of the unvaccinated are larger and larger and more plentiful and so they start to merge with each other, meaning that a case in one could ignite nationwide cases.\u201d",
      "A similar scenario occurred in Europe about 10 years ago and led to tens of thousands of cases, he said.",
      "\u201cThat is a likely scenario for the U.S.,\u201d Mina said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s this year, or next or the following, is tough to say.\u201d"

    "summary": "Some weather balloon launches have been suspended because of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the National Weather Service. That may hurt forecast accuracy.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, the National Weather Service has released weather balloons at a clockworklike cadence at more than 100 sites across the country, as well as over the Pacific and the Caribbean.",
      "Twice a day \u2014 at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. ET \u2014 meteorologists simultaneously launch the balloons, which are equipped with instruments called radiosondes that measure temperature, humidity and wind speed. They rise about 15 feet per second for two hours, traveling through layers of the atmosphere and sending pings of data back using radio waves.",
      "When the air gets too thin, the balloons pop and fall back to Earth with little parachutes \u2014 mission complete.",
      "Data from the balloons feeds into weather models that are the backbone of forecasts across the United States, whether they\u2019re delivered by a local television broadcaster or on your iPhone.",
      "But many of the release sites \u2014 at least 10 in the continental United States \u2014 have suspended or limited launches because of the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the National Weather Service staff.",
      "Meteorologists and weather balloon experts say the change will reduce forecast quality and increase risk during severe weather.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question it will lead to errors. It\u2019s just a matter of how bad will it be,\u201d said Matt Lanza, a meteorologist in Houston who writes for \u201cThe Eyewall\u201d blog. \u201cWe know these things help with forecasts, so why are we cutting them?\u201d",
      "The National Weather Service cuts are part of the Trump administration\u2019s widespread downsizing efforts across federal agencies. At the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, more than 600 workers were fired,\u00a0then reinstated, at least temporarily, after a court ruling. At science agencies overall, the administration has cut federal workers, slashed budgets and targeted diversity and equity programs.",
      "News of weather balloon reductions has trickled in over the last month. The NWS first said it would suspend balloon launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. Then it said it would miss some launches in Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine. Last week, it added Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, to the list of cancellations. It also limited flights to once per day at sites in Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The notices all cited staffing as a reason.",
      "Susan Buchanan, an NWS spokesperson, declined to answer questions about the changes.",
      "\u201cThe Public Information Statements we released contain all the information we have to offer at this time,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Several meteorologists said the balloon launch reductions are concentrated in parts of the United States where data is especially needed.",
      "\u201cThe really unfortunate thing is, where these balloons are now missing \u2014 the Colorado Rockies, the Wyoming Rockies, the northern and central High Plains \u2014\u00a0is where a lot of severe weather happens in the spring and summer months and [where] a lot of the storms that will impact the Great Lakes and Eastern United States first develop,\u201d said Chris Vagasky, the research program manager for Wisconet, a network of weather and soil monitoring stations across Wisconsin.",
      "Storms generally track from west to east in the United States, so weather balloons often provide reads on what can be expected downwind in the hours and days after they fly.",
      "The balloons provide the finest-resolution data about different layers in the atmosphere \u2014 information that can\u2019t be easily replicated by satellites or other equipment \u2014 so without them, scientists could be left guessing about the type of precipitation that will fall, for example.",
      "\u201cHere in New York, we often have very messy weather systems where they start as snow and turn into sleet and then freezing rain and rain,\u201d said Nick Bassill, the director of the State Weather Risk Communication Center at the University at Albany in New York. \u201cWe might have just one little thin layer that bumps you up above freezing, then suddenly your snowstorm turned into a rainstorm or freezing rainstorm.\u201d",
      "The balloons are among the most important sources of data for weather models, he and other forecasters said. When they compared various instruments used to aid forecasting, NASA researchers found that radiosondes had the second-biggest impact on forecast quality, after satellites.",
      "Bassill said meteorologists typically wait to run weather models \u2014 which produce estimates of temperature, wind speed and other meteorological data \u2014 until after a balloon has launched.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you have the most data that you can give the model,\u201d Bassill said. \u201cData that are collected in real time from these goes pretty much straight into weather models.\u201d",
      "Vagasky, who previously worked for the Finland-based manufacturer of the weather balloons the NWS uses, Vaisala, said it\u2019s not unheard of for the weather service to stop launching balloons at a site temporarily. For example, it decommissioned a site in Chatham, Massachusetts, because of coastal erosion. Helium shortages also led launches to be stopped in Denver and Tallahassee, Florida, over the past few years. (Balloons use helium or hydrogen, but in densely populated areas, meteorologists avoid hydrogen because it is flammable.)",
      "But between previous stoppages and the recent cuts, Vagasky said, \u201cwe\u2019ve gone from 200 balloons in the weather service network each day down about 15% in the last few years.\u201d",
      "That will leave forecast models without key data, he said.",
      "Without any weather balloons, Vagasky said, today\u2019s forecasts would be about 15% worse, citing NASA data.",
      "Russia once tried to cut its radiosonde launches in half, from January to April 2015, and European forecasters saw a decline in their model\u2019s forecast quality.",
      "The U.S. reduction is less dramatic, so it will take some time for scientists to tease out its statistical impact.\u00a0Bassill said that he suspects most people won\u2019t immediately notice a day-to-day difference if they\u2019re using weather applications on their phones but that there will be more surprises.",
      "Some private companies are trying to help fill newly opened gaps in the National Weather Service\u2019s system. The startup Windborne, which is developing a network of low-cost, long-range balloons to monitor hard-to-reach areas, offered to provide the NWS some of its data from Alaska after launches stopped at Kotzebue.",
      "John Dean, a co-founder of Windborne and its CEO, said he was surprised and concerned about the cuts to National Weather Service radiosondes. Dean said his company is working out logistics with NOAA to feed additional data to the agency for six months through an existing contract at no cost.",
      "But Dean said private businesses are unlikely to replace the service NOAA has provided. His company\u2019s goal was to add coverage, not replace it, by expanding balloons to the 85% of the globe that he said is poorly monitored.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not ready to fully replace radiosondes now, and it\u2019s not obvious that we ever will be,\u201d Dean said, noting that most private weather companies rely on NOAA data and models. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d see any kind of private company wanting to see NOAA services degraded.\u201d"

      "While some people may decry the lack of upsets in the first two rounds of the men\u2019s NCAA Tournament, the result is a Sweet 16 filled with the best teams in the country. All four No. 1 seeds are still alive, and there\u2019s plenty of talent on the rosters who are trying to upset them en route to the Elite Eight.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s to come in the tournament\u2019s second weekend.",
      "No. 6 BYU vs. No. 2 Alabama (7:09 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "This matchup figures to be a shootout between the top offense in the country (the Crimson Tide) and another that averages over 80 points per game (the Cougars). Alabama is in the Sweet 16 for the third straight season, and it has to be feeling confident after it cruised to victory in the second round despite a subpar performance by senior guard Mark Sears. BYU, meanwhile, sneaked past Wisconsin with a two-point win in the second round. Can the Cougars keep up with the Crimson Tide?",
      "No. 4 Maryland vs. No. 1 Florida (7:39 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "The Terrapins and the Gators are both coming off thrilling wins, with Maryland needing a Derik Queen buzzer-beater to put away Colorado State, while Florida executed a late comeback to knock off defending champ Connecticut. The Terps are likely to have their hands full with Gators guard Walter Clayton Jr., who has been shooting lights out through two tournament games. Clayton has scored 23 in each of the first two rounds and has hit nine of his 17 3-point attempts.",
      "No. 4 Arizona vs. No. 1 Duke (9:39 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "The Blue Devils have arguably been the most impressive team in the men\u2019s bracket, winning their first two games by an average of 33.5 points. Duke is going to be heavily favored again in this one, and it has actually already beaten the Wildcats this season. If Arizona has any chance, senior guard Caleb Love will need to have a big night, as he did against Oregon in the last round. Love, who played for North Carolina for three years, will at least be very familiar with his opponent.",
      "No. 10 Arkansas vs. No. 3 Texas Tech (10:09 p.m. ET Thursday)",
      "The Razorbacks are the lowest seed left in the men\u2019s tournament and the closest we have to a Cinderella story. Arkansas is coming off one of the best wins of the tournament, as head coach John Calipari exacted a little revenge on longtime foe Rick Pitino and the St. John\u2019s Red Storm with an upset win. Can Calipari continue his Razorbacks renaissance? Arkansas may be ranked 10th in this region, but the team has come a long way since it started 0-5 in SEC play.",
      "No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 2 Michigan State (7:09 ET Friday)",
      "A game that will be both a clash of styles and programs. The Spartans are in their 16th Sweet 16 under Tom Izzo, while the Rebels have made it past the second round for the first time since 2001. Ole Miss\u2019 success in the tournament has in large part been due to the long ball, as the Rebels are shooting 48.7% from deep through two games. Michigan State likes to get physical defensively, and Ole Miss will have to be prepared for a grittier game.",
      "No. 3 Kentucky vs. No. 2 Tennessee (7:39 p.m. ET Friday)",
      "These SEC foes will meet for the third time this year in Indianapolis, and the Wildcats have had the upper hand so far. Kentucky won both matchups against the Volunteers in the regular season, and in particular it gave Tennessee\u2019s offense fits. The Vols shot only 22.2% from 3-point range in their two losses to the Wildcats, unable to get shots to fall from outside. Tennessee is still favored in this one, but its mettle will be tested if shots aren\u2019t falling early.",

      "No. 5 Michigan vs. No. 1 Auburn (9:39 p.m. ET Friday)",
      "The Wolverines lost three straight to end the regular season but have been on a roll since, winning the Big Ten tournament before making their way to the Sweet 16. The frontcourt will be worth keeping an eye on in this game, as Michigan will throw out a combo of 7-footers \u2014 centers Danny Wolf and Vladislav Goldin \u2014 to counter the effectiveness of Auburn big man Johni Broome.",
      "No. 4 Purdue vs. No. 1 Houston (10:09 p.m. ET Friday)",
      "The final matchup of the weekend will be a pseudo-home game for the Boilermakers, with Lucas Oil Stadium only about 65 miles from Purdue\u2019s campus. Will a home-court boost be enough for the Boilermakers\u2019 offense, however? Purdue will need all the extra juice it can get to upset the Cougars, who are incredibly stingy on defense. Houston leads the country in points allowed per game, and only one opponent has broken 70 points in its last five contests."

      "In a major shake-up for the world of Formula 1, the Red Bull Racing team has decided to replace Liam Lawson after just two Grand Prix weekends in 2025 when he performed poorly.",
      "Yuki Tsunoda of Racing Bulls has been promoted to the seat starting at his home race in Japan on April 6, when he will be teammate to four-time reigning world champion Max Verstappen. Lawson, 23, will return to the junior team he drove for last year.",
      "Red Bull team principal Christian Horner called it a collective decision by the organization, adding that it could benefit from four-year F1 veteran Tsunoda's input to develop the Red Bull car this year.",
      "\u201cIt has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the RB21 at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,\" Horner said in a statement.",
      "\"We came into the 2025 season with two ambitions, to retain the World Drivers\u2019 Championship and to reclaim the World Constructors\u2019 title and this is a purely sporting decision,\" he added. \"We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21 and Yuki\u2019s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car. We welcome him to the Team and are looking forward to seeing him behind the wheel of the RB21.\"",
      "Last year, Red Bull cut Sergio P\u00e9rez\u2019s contract short and removed him after a string of poor performances. The potential replacements came down to Lawson, of New Zealand, and Tsunoda, who were both at the junior team. While Tsunoda had a modest edge on Lawson in their head-to-head battles, Red Bull opted in December to promote Lawson, instead, seeing more potential in him after he rapidly adapted to the car and occasionally outperformed his teammate.",
      "Now, it is all but admitting it made a mistake.",
      "\u201cWe have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and together, we see that after such a difficult start, it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience, as he continues his F1 career with Visa Cash App Racing Bulls, an environment and a Team he knows very well,\u201d Horner said.",
      "Tsunoda, 24, will finally get the job he has been chasing for more than four years at the junior team.",
      "The big question is whether he will perform well in the second seat at the Red Bull team, which has been described as \u201ccursed\u201d because of a dismal track record for Verstappen's teammates.",
      "That's because the car is widely known to play to Verstappen's eccentric driving style \u2014 with a sharp front end and a loose rear, which makes it hard to control but unlocks great potential for a driver who can handle the extreme sensitivity and narrow performance window. So far, only Verstappen has mastered it.",
      "P\u00e9rez, who was hired in late 2020 from outside the Red Bull family, was dismissed last year after he was blamed for costing the team the constructors\u2019 championship, even as Verstappen won the driver\u2019s trophy. Yet he had more success than the Red Bull juniors.",
      "Red Bull\u2019s driver development program, overseen by team adviser Helmut Marko, has delivered one disastrous result after another \u2014 its last success story was promoting Verstappen in 2016. (A Red Bull spokesperson declined to comment.)",
      "Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon were enlisted for the Red Bull team in 2019 and 2020, but both failed to perform and were removed. They eventually left the organization and found success at Alpine and Williams, respectively. The common denominator for them and P\u00e9rez \u2014 who helped lead his earlier Racing Point team to its first and only victory \u2014 was the Red Bull car, not the drivers.",
      "In 2023, Red Bull hired Nyck de Vries in its junior team but fired him mid-year and replaced him with Daniel Ricciardo, who made his return to the squad after having left in 2018. Ricciardo was being auditioned for a return to Red Bull alongside Verstappen, but he didn't live up to its expectations and left F1 last year.",
      "It has sparked questions among F1 analysts about whether the Red Bull car is so uniquely suited to Verstappen's style that it is undrivable by anybody else, even proven Formula 1 talents.",
      "That leaves Tsunoda with the biggest challenge of his career."

      "Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill into law Wednesday that will phase out the state's universal vote-by-mail system.",
      "Under the new law, registered voters will have to opt in to receiving a mail-in ballot instead of automatically receiving one, starting in 2029. Voting rights advocates said it marks the first time a state has rolled back a universal mail-in voting policy.",
      "Utah is one of eight states with a universal mail ballot system, and the only one of the group that is solidly Republican.",
      "The move is also the latest example of Republicans seeking to advance voting restrictions, both at the state and national level. In the years following the 2020 election as President Donald Trump and his allies began aggressively perpetuating false claims of\u00a0 voter fraud, several Republican-led states have enacted restrictive new voting laws, including stricter photo ID requirements.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to require people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote. Trump has at times also called for an end to mail-in voting. His latest executive order also requires that all ballots must be received by Election Day, an attempt to supersede states that allow mail ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted afterward.",
      "Under the law signed by Cox, voters will be required, starting in 2029, to opt in to a new system to receive and then send back a mail-in ballot. Voters can opt in to the new system when they apply for or renew a driver\u2019s license or state identification card, or when they vote in person.",
      "Utah's new law also changes the deadline for when a ballot must be sent in.",
      "It requires that county elections officials only count ballots that have been received before 8 p.m. local time on an Election Day. Previously, county elections officials had been permitted to count all ballots postmarked through the day before Election Day, as long as the ballot arrived in the mail up until two weeks after Election Day.",
      "The changes take Utah off the list of states that use a universal mail-in ballot system. The others are Nevada, Colorado, Washington State, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Vermont, as well as Washington, D.C.",
      "Critics of the new law Cox signed said that the changes are likely to make it more difficult for voters in rural areas to cast votes.",
      "\u201cUniversal mail voting was enormously popular in Utah because it gave voters more freedom and flexibility to vote. Utah is now the first and only state to roll back a universal mail voting system. Voters, especially those in rural areas, will bear the brunt of this restrictive move,\u201d Chris Diaz, the director of legislative tracking at the Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that tracks voting and state election bills, said in an email.",

      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will retest about 4,000 DNA samples after discovering some exam kits used last year and in early 2025 might be prone to \"intermittently poor performance,\"  authorities said Wednesday.",
      "The department received an Aug. 28 letter last year from the test kit manufacturer warning of these problems, but the notice \"was forwarded to an individual in the Sheriff\u2019s Department Scientific Services Bureau, who is no longer employed by the Department,\" according to a department statement.",
      "That bureaucratic misstep might have caused a months-long delay in removing those potentially faulty kits.",
      "\"However, it was recently discovered that the affected kits remained in use for approximately eight months, from July 2024 through February 2025,\" the sheriff continued.",
      "\"In response, the Department has launched an internal administrative investigation into this matter. There are established policies, procedures, and quality assurance safeguards in place to ensure reliability and consistency of scientific results.\"",
      "Based on the information provided by the DNA testing kit manufacturer, the use of the affected kits \"may have led to incomplete or suboptimal results\" but is not likely to have falsely identified any individual, the statement continued. \"To address the potential impact, the Sheriff\u2019s Scientific Services Bureau will retest approximately 4,000 samples.\"",
      "The L.A. County Sheriff's Department, with nearly 10,000 deputies and 8,000 other employees, is the nation's largest sheriff's department.",
      "\"We take the integrity of our criminal investigations and the reliability of our forensic testing very seriously,\u201d said Sheriff Robert Luna said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to thoroughly addressing this important issue, ensuring transparency, and taking immediate corrective action to protect the accuracy of ongoing and future cases.\"",
      "Sheriff's deputies and prosecutors from the L.A. County District Attorney's Office are reviewing cases.",
      "\u201cWe will follow the facts in whichever direction they take us on any individual case and make decisions that are in full accordance with the law on how to remedy any particular situation that requires such remediation,\" District Attorney Nathan Hochman said. \"Ensuring the integrity of the criminal justice process to build and maintain trust in its outcomes is paramount as we go forward.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Eleven Democratic senators sent a letter Thursday demanding an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Education Department, warning the cuts could have \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d",
      "The letter, sent to the department\u2019s acting inspector general, Ren\u00e9 Rocque, comes amid upheaval at U.S. agencies as President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk embark on a frenetic spree to slash government spending.",
      "Trump has long wanted to eliminate the Education Department \u2014 but can\u2019t do so entirely without congressional approval. Last week, he signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to start winding down the department, and earlier this month, the Education Department announced it was reducing its workforce by nearly 50%. McMahon said the move reflected the department\u2019s commitment to \u201cefficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.\u201d",
      "The senators balked at that in their letter, arguing that the cuts \u201cthreaten to hurt the very groups that the Department is purportedly aiming to serve.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe roughly 1,300 layoffs disproportionately target employees who served on teams that facilitate financial aid for tens of millions of families, enforce our civil rights laws, and ensure that every student has a place to learn in our K-12 public schools,\u201d they wrote in the letter, which was shared first with NBC News.",
      "There was no immediate response to the letter Thursday from the Education Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General or the Trump administration.",
      "In statements to NBC News, the senators who signed the letter said the administration\u2019s actions would harm generations of students.",
      "\u201cBillionaire co-presidents Donald Trump and Elon Musk are taking a chainsaw to public schools because it\u2019s not their kids who will suffer the consequences,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.",
      "Co-signer Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., urged a thorough investigation.",
      "\u201cParents, students and teachers across this country deserve to know just how badly Trump\u2019s extreme actions will decimate our education system and obstruct our ability to invest in our kids\u2019 futures,\u201d she said.",
      "The letter was also signed by Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut; Dick Durbin of Illinois; Mazie Hirono of Hawaii; Alex Padilla of California; Peter Welch of Vermont; Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland; and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.",
      "Merkley said in a statement that Trump\u2019s \u201cillegal gutting of the Education Department will only take good teachers out of the classroom and prevent students from accessing higher education,\u201d adding that he will \u201cfight like hell\u201d for students.",
      "\u201cOur teachers, students, and families deserve better than an administration determined to destroy public education in America,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has said he wants states, not the Education Department, to have oversight over the education system. His plan faces opposition from Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate, who worry that states will not be able to afford to replace the loss in federal funding.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s proposal, certain functions carried out by the Education Department would be transferred to other agencies. Trump said programs for students with disabilities would go to\u00a0the Department of Health and Human Services, for example, while federal student loans would be handled by the Small Business Administration.",
      "The senators questioned the legality of the proposed moves in their letter.",
      "\u201cThese actions likely contravene the law and will hurt students and families everywhere. Only Congress can choose to abolish the Department of Education; the President cannot shut down the Department by decree,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cAdditionally, the Higher Education Act, a federal law passed by Congress and signed by the President, explicitly requires the Department of Education to manage student financial assistance under Title IV, including student loans.\u201d",
      "They also expressed concern that the changes would impact other critical areas such as investigations into civil rights violations and research on educational outcomes.",
      "Decimating the Education Department \u201cthreatens to have disastrous consequences for American students, teachers, and families,\u201d the senators wrote.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, said gutting the Education Department would send class sizes soaring and make higher education further out of reach for all students.",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s educators and parents won\u2019t be silent as Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Linda McMahon try to steal opportunities from our students, our families, and our communities to pay for tax cuts for billionaires,\u201d the association\u2019s president, Becky Pringle, said in a statement to NBC News on Thursday.",
      "The senators are asking for an evaluation of both the financial feasibility of state and local governments taking over education funding and program administration as well as the possible far-reaching effects of dismantling the Education Department.",
      "Blumenthal said such an investigation is \u201cnecessary to better understand the impact of the Administration\u2019s recklessness.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s gutting of the Department of Education has thrown classrooms all across America into chaos,\u201d he said in a statement."

      "North Korea sent an additional 3,000 troops to aid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine this year, South Korea said Thursday, as Pyongyang\u2019s support appears to continue even as Moscow moves toward negotiations to end the conflict.",
      "The troop reinforcements were sent between January and February, bringing the total number of North Korean troops deployed to fight alongside the Russians to an estimated 11,000, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in an assessment Thursday.",
      "Around 4,000 of them are \u201cbelieved to have been killed or injured,\u201d it said.",
      "Seoul\u2019s update came as Russia\u2019s security council chief Sergei Shoigu met with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang last week, where he forwarded a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Russian state news agency TASS, Shoigu said they discussed security issues \u201cin different regions and on the Korean Peninsula in particular.\u201d",
      "Cooperation with North Korea continued even as Moscow and Kyiv agreed on a limited and temporary ceasefire, as the White House made shaky attempts in Saudi Arabia this week to broker a long-term deal. Both sides have already accused each other of violating the agreed-upon deal, which prohibits targeting energy infrastructure.",
      "The Ukraine military on Thursday said it shot down 42 drones launched by Russia toward various regions, including in the southern regions around Russian-annexed Crimea.",
      "It did not say if the drones targeted energy infrastructure.",
      "Separately, the Ukrainian emergency service said that at least 12 people were injured from a drone strike in Kharkiv on Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, European allies are expected to meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss aid for Ukraine and long-term peace, as U.S. support for Ukraine recedes under President Donald Trump.",
      "Beyond troops, Pyongyang has also continued to provide Moscow with munitions, Seoul has said. \u201cTo date, it is estimated that North Korea has supplied a substantial quantity of SRBMs, 170mm self-propelled guns, and about 220 240mm multiple rocket launchers,\u201d the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in the assessment.",
      "The volume of those weapons is also \u201cexpected to increase depending on battlefield developments,\u201d it added.",
      "North Korea\u2019s troops, widely considered disciplined and trained, nevertheless lack battlefield experience, which experts say is why they have suffered relatively high casualties from drone and artillery attacks.",
      "Still, Pyongyang\u2019s contribution is a further sign of deepening ties with the Kremlin, with which it signed a mutual defense treaty last year, elevating their status to that of formal allies. In return for its troops, North Korea may be receiving support for its growing nuclear ambitions, U.S. officials and others say.",
      "It\u2019s against this backdrop that Kim is considering a visit to Moscow, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Pyongyang.",
      "\u201cThe plans are big,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko was quoted as saying Thursday by the Russian news agency Interfax, reflected in the high-level delegation Russia is considering sending to North Korea. \u201cWe will implement them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits.",
      "Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "Without permission",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO\u2019s most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story."

      "Among major U.S. automakers, GM has the most extensive operations in Mexico and Canada, which would take a direct hit from the president\u2019s latest import taxes on vehicles and auto parts made abroad. The Chevy Silverado is produced by both of America\u2019s immediate neighbors, while the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain are manufactured in Mexico. The Chevy Trax compact SUV, meanwhile, comes from South Korea.",
      "\u201cTesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded [from tariff impacts] given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cGM has the most exposure to Mexico.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials suggested there would be a temporary carveout for vehicles and parts that complied with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement, but said how that would end up working was still being determined. At least one analyst suggested any auto tariffs that impacted Mexico and Canada would violate the agreement, which Trump negotiated during his first term.",
      "The new levies come just as the car industry notches the highest first-quarter new-vehicle sales in the U.S. since 2021, Edmunds analysts said Thursday, with strong demand in March contributing to a 1% jump from the same period a year ago. But analysts now say that trend could be in peril.",
      "\u201cWith nearly half of all vehicles sold being assembled outside of the U.S., we anticipate major repercussions from tariffs at any level,\u201d said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.",
      "Goldman Sachs estimated the 25% duties could drive up sticker prices by anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 per imported vehicle and by $3,000 to $8,000 for domestically made ones.",
      "Automakers appear to be treading cautiously with their public remarks on the policy change.",
      "\u201cU.S. automakers are committed to President Trump\u2019s vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans,\u201d Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement following the announcement. \u201cIt is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers.\u201d",
      "But Ford CEO Jim Farley was far less sanguine last month, saying at an investment conference that 25% tariffs would be \u201cdevastating\u201d and would \u201cblow a hole in the U.S. industry that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d",
      "Speaking at the same conference, GM executives signaled they were prepared to weather as much as 50% of the impact from any new tariffs.",
      "\u201cWhen we know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, and/or even have an indication of what\u2019s going to happen, we know the steps we could take,\u201d CEO Mary Barra said at the time. The company indicated it could take further steps to blunt the effects from long-lasting trade policies, including by shifting production.",
      "But on Thursday the president emphasized that his new auto tariffs would be \u201cpermanent.\u201d He has said they\u2019ll bring more auto production back to the U.S. and generate vast revenues for government coffers, ballparking those proceeds at up to $100 billion without providing details behind that estimate.",
      "Shares in Tesla surged as much as 4% Thursday, even as CEO Elon Musk said in an X post that the duties would \"affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries.\"",
      "\"The cost impact is not trivial,\" he added.",
      "However, analysts have concluded that Tesla is among the least-exposed overall to the duties. As early as Sunday, March 23, Tesla itself was posting that its cars were \"the most American-made.\"",
      "In his Wednesday remarks from the Oval Office, Trump asserted that Musk was not consulted about the duties.",
      "While automakers could each feel the impacts differently, the whipsawing White House trade policies are destabilizing for the entire industry, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen so far in this is an announcement and then a change, and then an announcement and then a change,\u201d Stephanie Brinley, automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility, said Wednesday evening. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody\u2019s breathing a sigh of relief.\u201d",
      "For automakers, she said, \u201cthe situation is still incredibly complicated and the decisions are complex, and the tariffs that were announced are one portion of a lot of things that go into global sourcing decisions.\u201d One silver lining, she added, is that \u201cif this settles it down, and this is what the tariff is, instead of back-and-forth at least you have an answer.\u201d",
      "Drury said the ripple effects from tariffs could be felt far beyond industry C-suites and dealership lots.",
      "\u201cAutomakers have huge investments to make, and the language of these tariffs could upend plans that were years in the making.

      "While industry experts and automakers brace for fallout, the nation\u2019s top autoworker union hailed the tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades,\u201d United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cEnding the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today\u2019s actions.\u201d",
      "The union had endorsed Trump\u2019s rival in last year\u2019s election, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, with Fain having slammed Trump as a \u201cscab\u201d standing against labor. UAW leaders at the local level, meanwhile, continue to voice concerns about White House trade policies.",
      "So far, major announcements of new auto production facilities continue to mount, though not in areas where the UAW has traditionally prevailed. A recent list of new electric vehicle plants highlighted by Automotive Dive showed just one such facility in the Midwest, with the rest dispersed throughout the South \u2014 a region with fewer labor protections and a deep base of Trump voters."

    "story": [
      "The protests at Columbia University last spring were dogged: Students galvanized by the war in Gaza staged demonstrations for weeks on end, erected tent cities on campus lawns and annexed a university building.",
      "But nearly a year later, as the university again finds itself at the center of unprecedented controversy, the student revolt that captivated the world appears to be largely absent.",
      "Students say that amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on international student protesters, the harsh punishment of some of last year\u2019s participants and the university's new rules restricting campus demonstrations, speaking out simply isn\u2019t worth the risk.",
      "A freshman Columbia engineering student said\u00a0he felt \u201cproud\u201d last year as he watched the protests from his home in Texas. But the student, who asked NBC News not to publish his name because of the sensitivity around the war in Gaza, said that while he\u2019d like to join protests this year, he won\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, frankly,\u201d the 18-year-old student said. \u201cNot every family of the people that will go out to protest have the financial capabilities to be able to afford a lawyer in the event that you\u2019re pressed charges.\u201d",
      "Sebastian Javadpoor, a senior who leads the university\u2019s student-led Democratic club, agreed. Students are avoiding protests by choice, he said: \u201cYou have students who are not participating in protests because they\u2019re terrified.\u201d",
      "On March 8, immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests last year. Khalil, who was born in Syria and is of Palestinian descent, was living in university housing on a student visa with his American wife, who is eight months pregnant.",
      "In the days that followed, another one of the university\u2019s international students was arrested and a third fled to Canada, according to the Department of Homeland Security. And on Monday, a fourth student who has lived in the country since she was 7 years old sued the Trump administration after, she said, immigration authorities tried to deport her.\u00a0The crackdown goes far beyond Columbia. In recent days, immigration authorities have arrested students at Georgetown University, Tufts University and the University of Alabama. NBC News obtained a video of authorities detaining Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts student, on Tuesday. It hows several Department of Homeland Security officers in plainclothes surrounding Ozturk, a Turkish national, grabbing her hands and taking her away as she screamed out in confusion.",
      "Last Friday, threatened by the Trump administration with the loss of $400 million in federal research grants for \u201cinaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\u201d the university acquiesced to sweeping changes.",
      "Columbia agreed to ban masks at protests in most cases, enlist 36 new campus security officers \u2014 who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students \u2014 and hire a senior vice provost to oversee the Department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies, according to a document the university said it shared with the federal government and posted on its website Friday.",
      "But students and faculty members protested the arrests and the changes in policy only a handful of times in recent weeks.",
      "Unlike the sprawling demonstrations last year, a student protest on March 14 was confined to a small, tight space outside the university gates. It was surrounded by police barricades and lasted just a few hours.",
      "On Monday, a few dozen faculty members held a vigil for democracy, which also took place off campus. A student activist group also encouraged students to sit out of classes and wear masks in defiance of the partial ban. Yet the response was muted, students said.\u00a0Most of the dozens of students NBC News approached in recent weeks declined to speak on the record. Many said they feared speaking out would get them in trouble with the university. (Earlier this month, the university announced that it suspended or expelled some of the students who participated in the takeover of Hamilton Hall last year.)",
      "Others said they feared that voicing their opinions would draw the ire of federal authorities. And some said they were simply fatigued by the controversies engulfing the university.",
      "Allie Wong, a Ph.D. student who was arrested while protesting on campus in April, said the Trump administration\u2019s actions and the university\u2019s response have had a \u201ctremendous chilling effect\u201d on a campus known for challenging authority.",
      "In 1968, Columbia students similarly took over Hamilton Hall to protest the U.S. government\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War, prompting more than 700 arrests. Not including last year, students blockaded or occupied the university academic building again at least four more times since then, according to the university\u2019s website.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this pride that this is the epicenter of constructive dialogue and social change,\u201d Wong said.",
      "But things are different now, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that people get arrested during protests,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is uncommon that in the aftermath of protests, a year later, that the president of the United States is going through and actively targeting individuals to make a spectacle out of it.\u201d\u00a0A Justice Department spokesperson said the department \u201cmakes no apologies for its efforts to defend President Trump\u2019s agenda in court and protect Jewish Americans from vile antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said the pressure put on Columbia by the federal government is an attempt to bring universities \u201cto heel\u201d and poses grave First Amendment concerns for other schools.",
      "\u201cThe goal is not just to chill that kind of speech at Columbia, but to chill it everywhere,\u201d Wizner said, \u201cand to communicate to every university, public and private, that if you don\u2019t engage in these kinds of crackdowns on your own, we\u2019re going to impose them with the threat of crippling funding cuts.\u201d",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in interviews this week that there was no timetable to restore the university\u2019s funding but that Columbia was \u201con the right track.\u201d",
      "A Columbia spokesperson said in a statement that the university intends to combat antisemitism while protecting free expression.\u00a0\u201cWe respect that there will be vigorous debate on campus about issues of academic freedom and protest, and we welcome that debate,\u201d it said.",
      "In a statement this week, Dr. Katrina Armstrong, the university\u2019s interim president, reiterated her commitment to \u201cseeing these changes implemented with the full support of Columbia\u2019s senior leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny suggestion that these measures are illusory, or lack my personal support, is unequivocally false,\u201d she wrote \u201cThese changes are real, and they are right for Columbia.\u201d",
      "Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Columbia didn\u2019t push back against the administration\u2019s demands. The AAUP, which defends the rights of faculty, sued several federal agencies Monday, arguing that the actions violated the professors\u2019 right to free speech.",
      "If the university won\u2019t \u201cstand up and fight back\u201d against government incursions, he said, \u201cthen it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t have the kind of higher education which has been the engine of this country\u2019s economy and democracy for the last 100 years.\u201d",
      "Michael Thaddeus, a professor of mathematics at Columbia who joined Monday's protest, said the mood among the faculty is \u201cprofound alarm and dismay.\u201d",
      "Still, to an outsider, life on campus might appear status quo, he said.",
      "\u201cClasses are continuing, athletic competition is continuing, the libraries are open. I was watching a campus tour go by outside,\u201d said Thaddeus. \u201cIt\u2019s just a weird combination of normal and very abnormal.\u201d"

      "The biological mother of a Connecticut man\u00a0allegedly held captive for decades by his stepmother has revealed new details about why she gave up custody \u2014 and vowed to be there for him now.",
      "Tracy Vallerand told NBC Connecticut on Wednesday that she gave up custody in 1993, shortly after his birth. Vallerand explained that she had lost custody of her daughter, Heather Tessman, years earlier after the Department of Children and Families alleged she had shaken baby syndrome. Tessman's father was charged with the crime.",
      "\"I was still having issues coping,\" Vallerand said in her first on-camera interview with her daughter.",
      "Vallerand explained when her relationship with her son's father ended, she allowed her son to live with him.",
      "\"Things didn\u2019t work out between the two of us, and I was thinking that I was giving my son a better chance at a full life,\" she explained. \"If I had known ... I just can\u2019t fathom ... I have no words.\"",
      "Vallerand's son, who has not been named, eventually started living with his father and stepmother, Kimberly Sullivan. Authorities allege that Sullivan held him captive in a small room at the family\u2019s home in Waterbury.",
      "The now 32-year-old was found on Feb. 17 after he started a fire\u00a0at the home using a lighter, hand sanitizer, and paper from a printer, according to an affidavit. Police say he explained he started the fire because \"I want my freedom.\"",
      "Prosecutors say that the stepson told authorities he had been locked inside an 8-by-9-foot room since the fourth grade. He told authorities that he was let out for brief periods in the mornings to do chores. Weighing only 68 pounds when he was found, he said he was fed two sandwiches a day and the equivalent of two small bottles of water.",
      "\"It's hard to think about what he had to go through,\" Vallerand told  NBC Connecticut. \"Just knowing that he was right there.\"",
      "Vallerand said she had tried to get back into his life but could never find him. Tessman said she never worried because \"as far as I knew, he was with his parents living his life.\"",
      "The mother and daughter said they plan on attending every court appearance for Sullivan, who is charged with assault, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, cruelty, and reckless endangerment.",
      "Sullivan's attorney, Ioannis Kaloidis, has denied the allegations. He said the man's biological father died in 2024.",
      "\"She wasn\u2019t controlling anything in his life,\" the attorney said. \"She continued to maintain the home, she continued to get groceries, she continued to keep the lights on, the heat on, and provided a shelter.\""

    "story": [
      "The chance to draw Betty White for a U.S. postage stamp was an easy \u201cyes\u201d for Boston-based illustrator Dale Stephanos.",
      "\u201cI said \u2018yes\u2019 before they finished the sentence,\u201d he recalls in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "White died in 2021 at the age of 99. Now, the late actor, known for her roles in \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d is being honored with Forever Stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service starting March 27.",
      "The stamp celebrates White\u2019s decades-long entertainment career and her advocacy for animals, an element subtly woven into Stephanos\u2019s design.",
      "For Stephanos, who has spent decades creating portraits for outlets like Rolling Stone, Mad Magazine, and Sports Illustrated, the Betty White stamp was particularly meaningful. The illustrator learned his conception for the stamp had been approved just days before his mother died.",
      "\u201cThis is now a very, very personal piece for me,\u201c he says. \u201c(My mother) got to see her son do something really cool.\u201d",
      "Stephanos recalls gathering around a television with his family to watch White on TV. His grandmother had also been named Betty, and in her final days, his mother, despite being in poor health, saw the design go viral.",
      "Stephanos recognized something familiar in White\u2019s trademark blend of wit and warmth \u2014 qualities that reminded him of home.",
      "\u201cShe reminded me of my mother. She had this real ability to say something, and then jaws would drop, and people would be like, \u2018Did she really just say that?\u2018\u201c he says. \u201cShe\u2019s one of those people who could get away with things that a lot of people couldn\u2019t because she was an older lady, and she had that sweet smile, and it\u2019s delivery \u2014 it was never mean. It was never mean. It was always good humor, even when she was roasting somebody.\u201d",
      "For the stamp, Stephanos drew inspiration from a portrait of White taken by Kwaku Alston in 2010. Alston\u2019s photograph shows White in the later part of her career, wearing red, eyes bright with her signature spark.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a great photo \u2014\u00a0a sweet spot in her older years,\u201c he says. \u201cI just kind of used that as reference and then kind of changed the colors and tried to make it more handmade than a photo would be.\u201c",
      "Stephanos\u2019 image is a stylized portrait of White dressed in purple instead of red to reflect a deeper part of White\u2019s legacy.",
      "\u201cPurple is the color of protest. She had such a positive personality. She never seemed angry, even though protest is a form of anger,\u201d he says.",
      "Even the earring he chose for White was selected with care.",
      "Stephanos sought a subtle way to reflect Betty White\u2019s animal advocacy in the stamp after her estate requested it be part of the design. One morning, Stephanos noticed his wife\u2019s animal-print dress and shiny earrings. He looked down and realized he had drawn a paw print, and an idea clicked.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, wait a minute. We could just do a paw print earring,\u201d he says.",
      "The small but meaningful detail was ultimately approved and became part of the final stamp, which can be seen on White\u2019s right ear in the portrait.",
      "Stephanos thinks of stamps as \u201clittle pieces of art\u201d that \u201cdress up our correspondence.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know when I get something with an interesting stamp, I take a second, I look at it and appreciate it. I think it\u2019s one of the great things that humans have figured out: a way to communicate in this way,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s part of why White\u2019s stamp means so much to him.",
      "\u201cThis is the only stamp I\u2019m going to use for the rest of my life,\u201c he says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going to be so obnoxious with this.\u201d",
      "When asked what kind of message he\u2019d send with it, his answer is certain.",
      "\u201cShe was such a positive, funny, witty, bright light,\u201d he says. \u201cI think anything that you want to send with a kind of a positive, happy tone (her stamp) would totally be appropriate.\u201d"

      "Duke University has responded to the latest episode of \"The White Lotus,\" calling the inclusion of a Duke T-shirt on a character who is contemplating suicide and killing members of his own family \"troubling.\"",
      "Frank Tramble, vice president for communications, marketing and public affairs at Duke University, said in a March 27 statement to TODAY.com that the school did not \"approve the use of its marks\" in the hit HBO show.",
      "\u201cDuke appreciates artistic expression and creative storytelling, but characters prominently wearing apparel bearing Duke\u2019s federally registered trademarks creates confusion and mistakenly suggests an endorsement or affiliation where none exists,\" Tramble said.",
      "\u201c'The White Lotus' not only uses our brand without permission, but in our view uses it on imagery that is troubling, does not reflect our values or who we are, and simply goes too far,\" he continued.",
      "Tramble noted that suicide is the second-leading cause of death on college campuses.",
      "\"As imagery from the show is being shared widely across social media, we are using our brand to promote mental health awareness and remind people that help is available,\" Tramble said.",
      "In Episode 6 of the hit HBO show, Jason Isaacs\u2019 character Tim Ratliff wears a Duke T-shirt as he ideates a potential murder-suicide, and vivid depictions of Tim killing himself and shooting other members of his family are shown throughout the episode.",
      "The scenes turn out to only be thoughts Tim is having, though his potential actions are shown in detail.",
      "HBO declined to comment on Duke's statement to TODAY.com.",
      "The rivalry between Duke and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a plotline on the show \u2014 Tim and his eldest son, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), both went to Duke, while his wife Victoria (Parker Posey) and their daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), attended Chapel Hill.",
      "And their youngest Ratliff son, Lochlan (Sam Nivola), is deciding between going to Duke and Chapel Hill while they're vacationing at the resort in Thailand.",
      "The reason the family went to Thailand was tied to Piper's studies at UNC as well. She told her family she needed to go to Thailand to complete her thesis at Chapel Hill, though it's later revealed that she actually wants to move to Thailand to study under a monk.",
      "While the family is vacationing, Tim learns he's under investigation for alleged financial crimes back at home \u2014 fueling his desperation on what to do in response."

    "summary": "The true story of Gold & Greed explained. Who was Forrest Fenn? Who found his treasure? What was in his poem? Where was his treasure found?",
    "story": [
      "When art and antiquities dealer Forrest Fenn revealed he had hidden a box of gold, jewels and other precious artifacts somewhere in the wilderness of the American West, he set off a decade-long treasure hunt that drew hundreds of thousands of seekers from around the world.",
      "People scaled mountains, rafted down rivers and trekked through forests in the hopes of discovering Fenn\u2019s secret box of riches, which was said to be worth up to $2 million. The legions of devoted treasure hunters were armed only with clues from a cryptic poem penned by Fenn, as well as other hints he scattered throughout his memoir and press interviews.",
      "Now, five years after the treasure was found, the mania around the quest is the subject of a new Netflix docuseries, \u201cGold & Greed: The Hunt for Fenn\u2019s Treasure.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the largest, biggest modern day treasure hunt of our time,\u201d director Jared McGilliard said in an interview Thursday with NBC News\u2019 Joe Fryer. \u201cIt harkens back to Indiana Jones \u2026 it just felt like a dream story to tell.\u201d",
      "The three-part series explores Forrest Fenn\u2019s motivations for hiding the treasure, and tells the stories of multiple people from all walks of life who sought the treasure for years.",
      "For many seekers, the quest for the treasure was rewarding in itself, McGilliard says.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little overused trope, but the journey is the adventure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt got people outside. It changed their perspective on themselves and their own life and what they can accomplish \u2026 People began to dream again, about how their life could change and on this amazing adventure.\u201d",
      "The series also explores the treasure hunt\u2019s dark side, notably the fact that five people lost their lives in their search for Fenn\u2019s cache of riches.",
      "And, without sharing any spoilers, the docuseries also includes one bombshell twist that suggests the hunt may not be over yet.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story behind \u201cGold & Greed,\u201d including who Forrest Fenn was, what his mysterious poem said, and how the treasure was found.",
      "Who was Forrest Fenn and what was his treasure?",
      "Forrest Fenn was an art and antiquities dealer and Vietnam War veteran based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His star-studded client list included Ralph Lauren, Robert Redford and Suzanne Somers, TODAY reported in 2013.",
      "In 1988, Fenn, who was born in 1930, learned he had kidney cancer and was told he had a 20% chance of surviving three more years.",
      "Facing this diagnosis, he pondered how he would be remembered and what he wished to leave behind. Eventually, when thoughts about his mortality \u201chit bottom,\u201d Fenn was struck by an idea.",
      "\u201cIt had been so much fun building my collection over the decades, why not let others come searching for some of it while I\u2019m still here, and maybe continue looking for it after I\u2019m gone?\u201d he wrote in his 2010 memoir, \u201cThe Thrill of the Chase.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I decided to fill a treasure chest with gold and jewels, then secret it \u2014 leaving clues on how to find it for any searcher willing to try,\u201d he continued.",
      "Fenn began filling an antique lock box with a heap of treasures he had accumulated over the years, including gold nuggets, two of which weighed more than a pound, and many other smaller gold pieces and coins, he revealed in his memoir.",
      "The box\u2019s treasures also included ancient Chinese carved jade figures, a Spanish 17th-century gold ring, and an antique gold bracelet set with 254 rubies, six emeralds, two Ceylon sapphires and several small diamonds.",
      "All told, the box contained about 20 troy pounds of gold and was estimated to be worth up to $2 million.",
      "Fenn spent years building the treasure box, and eventually hid it in the Rocky Mountains in around 2010, TODAY reported in 2013.",
      "As suggested by the title of his memoir, Fenn hid the box not only to enrich whoever found it, but to inspire treasure hunters to find intangible rewards in the search itself.",
      "\u201cGet your kids out in the countryside, take them fishing and get them away from their little hand-held machines,\u201d he told TODAY.",
      "In his memoir, he provided some clues as to the location of the treasure, noting it was \u201cin the mountains somewhere north of Santa Fe.\u201d He also said he hid the chest \u201cso it would be difficult to find but not impossible.\u201d",
      "Fenn also wrote a poem, included in his memoir, that he said contained nine clues about the location of the treasure. He noted that some subtle hints about the hidden loot were also scattered throughout his book.",
      "In addition to these clues, he appeared multiple times on TODAY in 2013 to reveal more hints about the location of the treasure. He shared that the treasure was not hidden in Idaho or Utah, nor was it hidden in a graveyard, hidden higher than 5,000 feet above sea level, or \u201cassociated with any structure.\u201d",
      "As interest grew in his hidden bounty, Fenn became an almost cult-like figure to thousands of fortune seekers, who combed through his writings and even used software to analyze his facial expressions in TV interviews to glean hints about the box\u2019s whereabouts, according to the documentary.",
      "Following his 1988 diagnosis, Fenn recovered from cancer. He died in Santa Fe of natural causes at 90 in 2020, the Associated Press reported. He was survived by his wife, Peggy, who died later that year, their two daughters, and multiple grandchildren.",
      "What did Forest Fenn's poem say?",
      "Fenn included a poem in his memoir that contained nine clues, which \"if followed precisely\u201d would lead to the location of his hidden treasure.",
      "\u201cThe clues are in consecutive order. If you want to find the treasure chest, you have my book,\u201d he told Lorena Mills in an interview on Report from Santa Fe in 2011.",
      "He said treasure seekers should begin by reading the book \u201cjust normally,\u201d and then go back and \u201cread the poem six, eight, 10 times, study every line, every word.\u201d",
      "Then, he recommended, \u201cread the book again slowly with the idea of looking for clues or hints that are in the book that will help you follow the clues (in the poem). You can find the chest with just the clues, but there are hints in the book that will help you with the clues.\u201d",
      "The poem reads as follows:",
      "As I have gone alone in there",
      "And with my treasures bold,",
      "I can keep my secret where,",
      "And hint of riches new and old.",
      "Begin it where warm waters halt",
      "And take it in the canyon down,",
      "Not far, but too far to walk.",
      "Put in below the home of Brown.",
      "From there it\u2019s no place for the meek,",
      "The end is drawing ever nigh;",
      "There\u2019ll be no paddle up your creek,",
      "Just heavy loads and water high.",
      "If you\u2019ve been wise and found the blaze,",
      "Look quickly down, your quest to cease,",
      "But tarry scant with marvel gaze,",
      "Just take the chest and go in peace.",
      "So why is it that I must go",
      "And leave my trove for all to seek?",
      "The answer I already know",
      "I\u2019ve done it tired, and now I\u2019m weak.",
      "So hear me all and listen good,",
      "Your effort will be worth the cold.",
      "If you are brave and in the wood",
      "I give you title to the gold.",
      "What happened during the hunt?",
      "Hundreds of thousands of treasure hunters around the world searched for Fenn\u2019s hidden box of riches, with some die-hard seekers devoting years of their lives to the quest.",
      "Fenn communicated regularly with fans, and once estimated he had received 13,000 emails and 18 marriage proposals from treasure seekers, according to journalist Ben Wallace, who wrote an in-depth feature about the quest for New York Magazine in 2020, and was interviewed in the documentary.",
      "The search \u201cgave them meaning in their lives and it led people to give up everything in pursuit of the treasure,\u201d Wallace said in the documentary. \u201cPeople were going through their savings to fund their searches, relationships ending, some people going to prison.\u201d",
      "A psychologist at the University of North Dakota even conducted a study on the Fenn treasure hunters in 2020 and found that 10% of seekers who blogged about their quests \u201cdescribed their involvement as a possible addiction.\u201d",
      "\u201cGold & Greed\u201d follows the stories of several devoted treasure hunters, including Cynthia Meacham, a retiree who trekked around the Rockies for years in search of the riches and developed a close personal relationship with Fenn.",
      "The documentary also chronicles the quest of Chris Hurst, a father who spent years hunting for the treasure in the Wyoming wilderness with his two sons in the hopes of giving his wife an easier retirement. The Hursts sold many of their assets and downsized their home to help fund their quest, Wyoming\u2019s Powell Tribune reported in 2020.",
      "For Justin Posey, another treasure seeker featured in the documentary, the hunt was \"less about the gold.\"",
      "\"It was about solving this puzzle that combined poetry and history and wilderness exploration,\" he told Joe Fryer on NBC News. \"It was just about deciphering the clues. And it almost became like a meditative experience.\"",
      "While Posey didn't find the treasure, he became linked to Fenn's legacy in another surprising way, as revealed in a major twist at the end of the docuseries.",
      "While Fenn\u2019s hidden treasure inspired wonder and an Indiana Jones-like sense of adventure in many searchers, the chase also had a dark side.",
      "At least five people died while seeking the treasure, including Randy Bilyeu, whose body was found near the Rio Grande river months after he went missing while searching for the loot in 2016, according to The Guardian. Another searcher, Paris Wallace, was also found dead along the Rio Grande the following year.",
      "Treasure hunter Jeff Murphy died after falling 500 feet in Yellowstone National Park in 2017, and searcher Eric Ashby drowned while rafting the Arkansas River in Colorado.",
      "A fifth treasure seeker, Michael Wayne Sexson, also died in 2017 after trekking into Dinosaur National Monument along the Utah-Colorado border without adequate clothing or food, according to the Denver Post.",
      "As the potential dangers of the quest became more apparent, Pete Kassetas, the former New Mexico State Police Chief, publicly implored Fenn to call off the search.",
      "\u201cI did not know how to stop this. I wanted to quit sending in people to save the searchers,\u201d Kassetas said in the documentary.",
      "In 2017, Fenn said in a statement that he would not encourage people to stop seeking the treasure.",
      "\u201cI have given a lot of thought about ending the search, but I am not sure what that would accomplish,\u201d the statement read, as shown in the documentary.",
      "Who found Forrest Fenn's treasure?",
      "The search for Fenn\u2019s treasure ended a decade after it began when it was confirmed that Jack Stuef, a then-32-year-old medical student, had found the antique box in Wyoming on June 6, 2020.",
      "\u201cThis treasure hunt was the most frustrating experience of my life,\u201d Stuef wrote in a Medium essay that year. \u201cThere were a few times when I, exhausted, covered in scratches and bites and sweat and pine pitch, and nearing the end of my day\u2019s water supply, sat down on a downed tree and just cried alone in the woods in sheer frustration.\u201d",
      "He did not disclose the exact location of the treasure, although other seekers later used photos to zoom in on the exact place the box had likely been discovered, as shown in the documentary.",
      "Stuef, who described himself as a \u201cmillennial with student loans to pay off,\u201d sold the majority of Fenn\u2019s treasure at auction in 2022.",
      "The final auction brought in about $1.3 million and included more than 400 items, including gold coins and nuggets, gold dust, and precious jewelry, as well as a glass jar holding a scroll apparently printed with a 20,000-word autobiography of Fenn, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "Stuef said he had initially hoped to maintain his anonymity, and said Fenn had been fully supportive of protecting his identity.",
      "\u201cNot because I have anything to hide, but because Forrest and his family endured stalkers, death threats, home invasions, frivolous lawsuits, and a potential kidnapping \u2014 all at the hands of people with delusions related to his treasure,\u201d Stuef wrote in a later Medium essay. \u201cI don\u2019t want those things to happen to me and my family.\u201d",
      "However, Stuef ended up revealing his identity in December 2020 after he learned about what he described as a \u201cmeritless lawsuit\u201d was going to be brought against him by a woman he didn\u2019t know.",
      "\u201cThis would make my name a matter of public record, so I chose to come forward today,\u201d he wrote on Medium.",
      "He called the lawsuit an \u201cabuse of the court system\u201d and maintained he was \u201cthe legitimate finder of the treasure.\u201d",
      "Stuef says he was \u201cthankful\u201d to meet Fenn once before he died, and honored the collector and author\u2019s legacy in an essay after he died in 2020.",
      "\u201cOf course, Forrest\u2019s greatest gift to humanity was his treasure,\u201d Stuef wrote. \u201cSure, it could only be given to one person, the one who found it, but it inspired hope the world over and the joy of discovery for all those who got to go out and appreciate the wonders of the Rockies.\u201d"

      "Darlene (Sara Gilbert) is encouraged by the news and thinks a financial settlement could give the family a much needed \"safety net.\" However, her father Dan (John Goodman) isn't so keen on the idea and says, \"We'll lose because they've got big, fancy lawyers.\"",

      "Louise says he doesn't have to go through with it, but Dan says he feels guilty and basically wants her to force him to do it. However, she says it's not her decision to make.",
      "Later in the episode, Dan and Jackie argue about the case and Jackie questions Dan about how he's changed, saying he used to be someone \"who would never walk away from a fight.\" Jackie says she feels like she needs to start a case and he tells her to do what she has to do.",
      "\"I have the guts to do something you won't,\" she says. \"If you don't hear from me it's because I don't know who are you are anymore, Dan.\"",

      "Mark reassures Jackie that he's going to stop when he has enough money for school, but she's not so sure. Jackie, meanwhile, has been contemplating a return to the police force and lets Mark know his actions could lead him to be on the police's radar."

    "story": [
      "In his acting career, Robert DeNiro has portrayed a godfather, an Irishman, and a good fella. Now, he plays a pair of wise guys.",
      "In \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d DeNiro plays not one, but two infamous mobsters: Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, a pair of mafia leaders who grew to power in tandem and became practically destined rivals in the New York City crime scene.",
      "Written by Nicholas Pileggi, author of \u201cWiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family,\u201d the book that inspired the mafia and crime drama standard \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d this Barry Levinson-directed film (director of \u201cRain Man\u201d) is a heavily detailed historical telling of the relationship between Costello and Genovese, including a power struggle and an attempted killing that leave the once close-knit ties between the two mob bosses strained.",
      "Costello, referred to as \u201cking of the rackets\u201d in the film, preferred to do most of his work from behind the scenes. On the other hand, DeNiro\u2019s other role as the Naples-born Vito Genovese is ambitious, power-hungry and in search of being the \u201cboss of bosses\u201d of the mafia, using aggressive tactics to gain power.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d follows the two mafia bosses\u2019 effective rivalry created when Genovese arrives home from Naples after World War II in search of Costello\u2019s position as head boss.",
      "Keep reading for an in-depth look at the depiction of crime bosses Frank Costello and Vito Genovese.",
      "Who were Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?",
      "Vito Genovese and Frank Costello both came to the New York after being born in Italy, then became involved in organized crime.",
      "Vito Genovese was 15 years old when he arrived in New York City from Naples, Italy. His first brush with the law came when he was 19, according to \u201cThe Deadly Don: Vito Genovese\u201d by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anthony M. DeStefano. By the time he was in his 60s, per 1958 letter to the FBI director included in a FOIA request document, he was \u201cwithout a doubt one of the most notorious of the country\u2019s hoodlums.\u201d",
      "Originally named Francesco Castiglia and born in Calabria in 1891, Frank Costello came to Manhattan as a child in 1895. According to the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement, Costello became a member of the Five Points Gang in Manhattan and was jailed for at least four times for assault, robbery and at least four counts of weapons possession between 1908 and 1918.",
      "Costello then became a well-known bootlegger during the Prohibition era. Working alongside other well-known criminals \u2014 most importantly the infamous Charles \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano \u2014 he was associated with Joe Masseria\u2019s bootlegging organization among other ventures throughout the 1920s, per the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement.",
      "In 1931, Luciano established and led the \u201cCommission,\u201d a union of the five most powerful families in the criminal underworld, in the aftermath of the bloody Castellammarese War. Genovese became his underboss, with Costello serving as Genovese\u2019s consigliere.",
      "What was their relationship like?",
      "In \u201cThe Deadly Don: Vito Genovese,\u201d DeStefano lays out Costello and Genovese\u2019s tense relationship and how it came to be that way.",
      "According to DeStefano, the rivalry began when Luciano received a prison sentence for up to 50 years for compulsory prostitution in 1936, and gave the reigns to Costello instead of Genovese.",
      "The book describes Costello as a \u201cmobster-diplomat whose entrenchment with the Democratic party, conciliatory manner, and legitimate interests\u201d made him a good choice for the role. \u201cSo long as Costello was around, Genovese had a sense of inferiority,\u201d the book reads.",
      "But Genovese wasn\u2019t around for long. In 1937, the year after he was naturalized an American citizen, Genovese fled New York because he was named a suspect in the 1934 murder of Ferdinand Boccia.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d picks up in 1945 when Genovese arrived back in New York from Italy, after being indicted in the murder. He was later acquitted due to a lack of evidence from a corroborating witness, the New York Times wrote at the time.",
      "The movie follows Genovese back in New York getting his bearings and working with Costello to get back on the street. Then, Costello got sent away: He was convicted of obstructed and lying to Congress and served 18 months.",
      "While Costello was in prison, Genovese became the top acting boss of the Luciano family",
      "Genovese attempted to maintain control of the Commission even after Costello left prison. He ordered a hit on Costello outside his Central Park West apartment building in 1957.",
      "\"The shooting of Costello only grazed his head, and the old crime boss fully recovered. But Costello got the message, and in a truce with Genovese, he agreed to 'retire' from the mob, leaving leadership of the family in Genovese's hands,\" DeStefano writes.",
      "What happened to Vito Genovese and Frank Costello?",
      "Later in 1957, Genovese and other mafia bosses gathered in the Apalachin, New York home of Joseph Barbara.",
      "According to DeStefano's book, the purpose of the meeting was for Genovese to anoint himself \"as boss of the family.\" Other business included the murder of mafia boss Albert Anastasia, which occurred earlier that year.",
      "Law enforcement broke up the meeting and took over 60 attendees in for questioning. Charges were later dropped, but the meeting \"backfired badly\" for the mobsters, according to DeStefano's book. The meeting also forced FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to acknowledge the mafia publicly for the first time, changing the course of organized crime history.",
      "Genovese later received a 15-year prison sentence for narcotics trafficking and died in prison in 1969.",
      "Costello died of a heart attack at age 82 after living a life out of the public. Costello\u2019s obituary mentioned his interest for gardening in his Long Island home during his life out of the mafia, referenced in the conclusion of the film."

      "In \u201cThe Dream Hotel\u201d universe, officials use dream-monitoring data to predict whether someone could pose a threat to society. Sara's dreams are enough of a threat to land her at a retention center with other \u201cdreamers,\u201d all of whom are trying to prove their innocence.",
      "Lalami\u2019s latest novel is not only a commentary on today\u2019s heightened surveillance, but also the role that technology plays in an increasingly distrusting world.",

      "\"The Memory Police\"",
      "Taking place on an unnamed island, \u201cThe Memory Police\u201d follows the eerie disappearance of various everyday objects \u2014 and how people have been made to forget them altogether.",
      "The novel details \u201ca writer who discovers that someone close to her actually remembers the forbidden words,\u201d Lalami explained.",

      "About 3 million people visit the trail each year, but only 4,000 attempt to hike the entirety of it, like Valerie does.",

      "\u201cThey could tell I was a fake. I was way too relaxed,\u201d she laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s such an intensity and a focus to the people that make it on the through the trail.\u201d",
      "Gaige was also struck by the story of Geraldine Largay, a retired nurse who disappeared from the trail in 2013. Her remains were found two years later, in 2015. Alongside her body were letters she had written to her family in her journal.",
      "\u201cThat was really the spark of the book \u2014 the letters. The book is all one letter to her mom,\u201d Gaige says.",
      "In addition to being a survival story, Gaige calls \u201cHeartwood\u201d her \u201cmother-daughter\u201d book because of how many mother-daughter dynamics it contains and explores. In contrast with Valerie and her beloved mother, Beverly and Lena both have complicated feelings they unfurl over the course of the novel.",
      "\u201cThe mother is really the most important figure outside oneself, it seems like, for the one\u2019s entire life. Sometimes it\u2019s because she was wonderful, and sometimes it was because she wasn\u2019t and did not give you the love you needed. And so you chase that for the rest of your life,\u201d she says.",
      "Reading the book, Gaige hopes readers ask themselves about times that they were lost and how they managed to find themselves.",
      "\"Have you ever been physically lost? How did it feel? Why is it so scary? When have you been emotionally or spiritually lost, and also, who rescued you? There's always somebody. Even in the darkest times, there's somebody who sees you, who steps in,\" she says.",

      "\"I totally do,\" she says. \"When have you ever gone out in nature and come home and regretted it?\"",

      "Shriver, 69, wrote in her new book's introduction about a moment after she learned Schwarzenegger had been involved in a sexual relationship with their housekeeper that produced a son, Joseph Baena, now 27.",
      "\"As I sat on the hotel room floor in the dark, terrified and alone with tears streaming down my face, I thought to myself: Maria, this doesn't have to be the end of the you. It can't be the end of you. Make it a new beginning of you,\" she wrote.",
      "Shriver discussed that moment with close friend Oprah Winfrey on the March 25 episode of the \u201cOprah\u201d podcast, saying, \"It\u2019s still an emotional thing for me, but I wanted to pick myself up. I wanted to be more open. I wanted to come out from behind whatever padded door I was living behind.",
      "\"I wanted to know how that had happened to me. I wanted to know who I could be moving forward,\" she continued. \"I wanted to show my daughters and my boys that I could hold myself up with my shoulders back, that I could heal.\"",
      "Shriver told Winfrey she really didn't \"know how to heal\" at the time, but was determined to do so both for her kids and for herself.",
      "\"I had just started going to therapy at the end of my marriage so I had not been someone who had been in therapy,\" she explained. \"I had not been someone who was on the healing path of life. And I went all in.\"",
      "Shriver, who put her broadcast journalism career on the back burner while Schwarzenegger was in office, recalled that until the couple's painful breakup, she was \"playing all the roles\" in life.",
      "\"I was being a daughter. I was being a journalist. I was being a mother,\" she said, adding, \"It's a lot. Everybody I talk to who's trying to raise kids, take care of parents, work themselves, be a good wife \u2014 you're not really thinking about a lot of other things.\"",
      "Winfrey recalled that in 2011, on the day the story about Schwarzenegger's affair went public in the media, Shriver, who had known about his betrayal for a while by that point, was scheduled to appear at a live taping for the last episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\"",
      "\"I have never seen a friend like you,\" said Winfrey. \"Because on the night that you knew that was going to be going public, you came and you showed up for me ... and I don't know how you did that. You weren't even in your right mind.\"",
      "Shriver responded, \"I wanted to be there for you because you had been there for me,\" adding that \"showing up\" for the people she loves is important to her.",
      "Shriver and Schwarzenegger tied the knot in 1986 after several years of dating. Shriver filed for\u00a0divorce in 2011 and the divorce was\u00a0finalized in 2021.",
      "The former couple share kids Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, 35,\u00a0Christina Schwarzenegger, 33,\u00a0Patrick Schwarzenegger, 31, and\u00a0Christopher Schwarzenegger, 27.",
      "During a May 2023 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the former governor called his divorce from Shriver \u201cmy failure.\u201d",
      "The action star noted it was a coincidence that he played a divorced CIA operative who was unfaithful to his wife in his new Netflix series \u201cFubar.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut in (my real-life marriage to Shriver), it was my f---up. It was my failure,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cAlso, in the show, he\u2019s deep down still in love with his wife.\u201d",
      "Schwarzenegger, who's been dating physical therapist Heather Milligan for more than a decade, added that he still loves Shriver. \"She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids,\" he said."

      "On Tuesday, Ballal \u2014 his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood \u2014 recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during a settler attack on his village.",
      "The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word \u201cOscar.\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski \u2014 who has threatened Ballal in the past \u2014 denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn\u2019t know Ballal was an Oscar winner.",
      "The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.",
      "\u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019",
      "The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It\u2019s part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts the Palestinian residents\u2019 attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military\u2019s plans to demolish their homes.",
      "At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.",
      "Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.",
      "\u201cI told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.",
      "Lamia Ballal, the director\u2019s wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d",
      "Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. \u201cHe broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,\u201d he said.",
      "He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal\u2019s house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night\u2019s events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.",
      "On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal\u2019s home, and the family car\u2019s windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.",
      "Under detention",
      "Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.",
      "Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was \u201cfreezing\u201d from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.",
      "The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll my body is pain,\u201d he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron.",
      "Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.",
      "Confrontations with settlers",
      "In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight.",
      "\u201cThis is my land, I was given it by God,\u201d Luski says. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be nice.\u201d He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to\u00a0Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife.",
      "\u201cRape for a higher cause,\u201d he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.",
      "The film \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a\u00a0joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually\u00a0turn a blind eye\u00a0or intervene on behalf of the settlers.",
      "The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed\u00a0ending the lease\u00a0of a movie theater that screened it.",
      "Basel Adra, another of the film\u2019s co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there\u2019s been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping this.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.",
      "The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and\u00a0displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis."

      "Asked if the U.N. believed the compound had been deliberated targeted, Dujarric said: \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons we need to have a pretty clear and transparent investigation. The point is that the Israelis knew exactly where this\u00a0UN\u00a0facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military said its forces had\u00a0fired on Monday at a building belonging to the Red Cross\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza\u2019s southern city of Rafah as a result of incorrect identification, after an office belonging to the aid organization was damaged by an explosive projectile."

      "This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0 roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.",
      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",

      "Sometimes, people who speak English alongside other languages use loanwords with \u201cenough frequency\u201d that they eventually become part of the vocabulary of their variety of English, Salazar said.",
      "Aside from gigil, the list includes 10 other loanwords from the Philippines, such as videoke, the Filipino version of karaoke, and terror, a strict, harsh or demanding teacher.",
      "Twelve of the new words come from the Philippines\u2019 Southeast Asian neighbors Malaysia and Singapore. Nearly half of them refer to food such as otak-otak, a dish consisting of seafood mixed with spices and coconut milk, and ketupat, a small rice cake boiled in a pouch of woven palm leaves.",
      "The region\u2019s colloquial exclamation alamak, which is used to convey surprise and dismay, is also included in the list, though its exact origin is uncertain.",
      "Of the 11 words borrowed from South Africa, two are expressions that relate to feelings of frustration and anger \u2014 gatvol, a slang term describing a person who feels extremely annoyed, and the hell-in, a colloquial phrase used predicatively to talk about a furious individual.",
      "Irish contributes eight loanwords to the OED update. They include debs, a formal social event for students, and class, a general term of approval that appears in the popular Northern Ireland sitcom \u201cDerry Girls.\u201d",
      "With around 500,000 words and 150 years of history, the OED is widely regarded as the accepted authority on the English language.",
      "OED editors review thousands of word suggestions every year to determine which words to include in updates.

The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem\u2019s trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is arguing in federal court that it was justified in sending the Venezuelans to El Salvador, while activists say officials have sent them to a prison rife with human rights abuses while presenting little evidence that they were part of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so."

      "CHEONGSONG, South Korea \u2014 Helicopters dumped water over a burning forest in South Korea on Thursday as authorities struggled to contain the country\u2019s worst-ever wildfires, which have killed 26 people, forced at least 37,000 others to flee their homes and destroyed more than 300 structures.",
      "Multiple wildfires have been raging across South Korea\u2019s southeastern regions since last Friday. The government has mobilized thousands of people, dozens of helicopters and other equipment to extinguish the blazes, but officials said strong winds are hampering their efforts.",
      "Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said \u201ca small amount\u201d \u2014 less than 0.2 inches \u2014 of rain was expected in the area on Thursday, not enough to play a meaningful role in extinguishing the wildfires.",
      "The fatalities include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire and four firefighters and other workers who died after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds.",
      "Authorities have not disclosed details of the civilian dead, except that they are mostly in their 60s and 70s. They suspect human error caused several of the wildfires, including cases where people started fires while clearing overgrown grass from family tombs or with sparks during welding work.",
      "The wildfires have burned 88,980 acres of land in the southeast, the government\u2019s disaster response center said in a report Thursday. Observers say that is the worst figure of its kind in South Korea. The report said the blazes have also injured 30 people, eight of them seriously, destroyed 325 buildings and structures and forced more than 37,180 people to evacuate.",
      "As of Thursday morning, the center said authorities were mobilizing more than 9,000 people and about 120 helicopters to battle the wildfires.",
      "In Cheongsong, one of the fire-hit areas, thick plumes of smoke were billowing from Juwang Mountain. Helicopters repeatedly hovered over the mountain, dropping water. The amount of smoke later appeared to have diminished.",
      "At a Buddhist temple near the mountain, workers covered a stone pagoda and other structures with fire-resistant materials, while firefighters poured water on sites near the temple.",
      "\u201cDamages are snowballing,\u201d acting President Han Duck-soo said in a televised address on Wednesday. \u201cThere are concerns that we\u2019ll have wildfire damages that we\u2019ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities on putting out the wildfires this week.\u201d",
      "The hardest-hit areas include Andong city and the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan.",
      "On Wednesday night, strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, home to the Hahoe folk village \u2014 a UNESCO World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century. Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jiri Mountain as another fire spread closer.",
      "Officials said earlier this week that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in key areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.",
      "Destroyed in the blazes were houses, factories, vehicles and some historic structures. In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, which was said to be originally built in the 7th century, have been burned. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d \u2014 a pavilion-shaped building erected overlooking a stream in 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",
      "The Korea Forest Service has raised its wildfire warning to the highest level, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un observed tests of newly developed reconnaissance and attack drones this week and called for their increased production, state media said Thursday.",
      "Kim has been emphasizing the development of drones, and the tests were the latest display of his country\u2019s growing military capabilities.",
      "Photos released by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency showed Kim observing what appeared to be a large reconnaissance drone roughly resembling Boeing\u2019s E-7 Wedgetail airborne warning and control aircraft. Other images showed exploding drones crashing into military vehicles used as targets.",
      "The agency said the test demonstrated the reconnaissance drone\u2019s ability to track multiple targets and monitor troop movements on land and at sea, potentially enhancing North Korea\u2019s intelligence-gathering operations and ability to neutralize enemy threats. The report said the new exploding drones were designed for various attack missions and featured unspecified artificial intelligence capabilities.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the drones\u2019 performance and approved plans to expand production, emphasizing that drones and AI should be \u201ctop\u201d priorities in efforts to advance his armed forces and adapt them to modern warfare, KCNA said. The agency said the tests took place as Kim visited a drone technology complex and an electronic warfare research group on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "The South Korean Defense Ministry did not immediately comment on the North Korean report.",
      "Kim previously inspected other demonstrations of drones that explode on impact in November and August last year.",
      "North Korea also accused South Korea last year of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North\u2019s capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occurred again. The South Korean military did not confirm whether the North\u2019s claims were true.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have escalated recently as Kim continues to expand his military capabilities, which now include various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim is also aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, sending troops and military equipment to support Russia\u2019s efforts. This has raised concerns that he may receive Russian technology transfers in return, further strengthening the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a report Thursday that it believes North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia in January and February and has continued supplying ammunition, short-range missiles, self-propelled howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. The Joint Chiefs assessed that, of the approximately 11,000 North Korean troops sent to fight in the war against Ukraine, around 4,000 have been killed or injured."

    "story": [
      "Chinese researchers are reporting new steps in the quest\u00a0for animal-to-human organ transplants\u00a0\u2014 with a successful pig kidney transplant and a hint Wednesday that pig livers might eventually be useful, too.",
      "A Chinese patient is the\u00a0third\u00a0person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",
      "Scientists are\u00a0genetically altering pigs\u00a0so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014\u00a0two pig hearts\u00a0and\u00a0two pig kidneys\u00a0\u2014 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2014 an\u00a0Alabama woman\u00a0who received a transplant in November and a\u00a0New Hampshire man\u00a0who received one in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \u201cis very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang, of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an, told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital\u2019s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman who was diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",
      "The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.",
      "\u201cWe do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,\u201d Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.",
      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support\u00a0by externally attaching a pig liver\u00a0to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",
      "In China, Wang\u2019s team didn\u2019t remove the deceased person\u2019s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.",
      "That \u201cclouds the picture,\u201d said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn\u2019t involved with the work. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully a first step but it\u2019s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.\u201d",
      "Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.",
      "According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it\u2019s unclear how that experiment turned out."

    "story": [
      "Latin America has been the cradle of\u00a0now globally popular literary and\u00a0musical genres, staple foods like the potato and\u00a0the inspiration behind the well-known Happy Meal.  It could also become the cradle of a new form of AI.",
      "A coalition of research institutions is working on what they call\u00a0LatAmGPT \u2014  a tool that can take into account the region's language variances, cultural experiences and \u201cidiosyncrasies.\u201d",
      "The aim is to offer users a more faithful peek into and representation of the Americas and the Caribbean than that of large language models (LLMs) that have mostly come from U.S. or\u00a0Chinese\u00a0companies and were largely trained in English.",
      "\u201cWe want to develop our capabilities, find local AI-based solutions and create a better understanding of these tools in Latin America and about Latin America,\u201d said Rodrigo Dur\u00e1n Rojas, director of Chile\u2019s National Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is coordinating the effort.",
      "Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that for general purposes, the project will be hard pressed to compete with \u201cstate of the art models with multimillion budgets,\u201d but that \u201cwhat our model can offer that others don\u2019t is a much richer and representative outlook of Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d its people and its outputs.",
      "For example, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said initial testing has shown LatAmGPT to have far better results when queried about South American history, and that the same is expected for when the LLM is asked to, say, write a poem in the style of local authors or provide an overview of regional education policy.",
      "There are more than 30 institutions involved in developing LatAmGPT from countries across the hemisphere, and collaborators include Latinos in the U.S. such as Freddy Vilches Meneses, an associate professor of Hispanic studies at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon. This,\u00a0he\u00a0said, is in recognition of how \u201cLatino and Latin American experiences are a cultural fellowship that goes beyond geography.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are elements of Latin America in Oregon, in California, in Texas,\" Vilches Meneses said. \"We want to make sure to incorporate that Latino experience as well.\u201d",
      "LatAmGPT, which aims to launch its first publicly available version around June, was announced last month\u00a0on the heels of\u00a0a\u00a0regional\u00a0commitment\u00a0made\u00a0during a\u00a0summit\u00a0on artificial intelligence in Uruguay to focus on \u201cethical, inclusive and beneficial\u201d technological development to \u201cpromote and protect human rights\u201d and explore the best possible public policies for AI governance.",
      "That impulse follows an increasing uptake in the region of technological advances such as the use of drones to monitor deforestation\u00a0in the Amazon rainforest, the development of apps to encourage more people to continue learning\u00a0Indigenous languages, the creation of\u00a0algorithms\u00a0to aid in the search for\u00a0forcibly disappeared\u00a0people or the adoption of\u00a0blockchain mechanisms to preserve historical documents of past dictatorship's actions.",
      "Some of those preserved documents are now being used as sources to train LatAmGPT, along with papers, records and logs that institutions such as libraries and national archives have made available specifically for the project. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said this gives the model more nuance and localized breadth than the general internet data scraping other systems tend to use.",
      "\u201cLatAmGPT will have more context than the other model languages and should therefore hallucinate far less\u201d when it comes to its use cases, Dur\u00e1n Rojas said. Hallucination is what AI researchers call when a model seemingly makes up an answer that's incorrect or\u00a0false though it's presented as factual.",
      "So far the project\u2019s dataset has more than 8 terabytes of information so the model can run on about 55 billion parameters (the variables with which an LLM makes a prediction output, like neurons that synapse or connect in a human brain). Dur\u00e1n Rojas said that\u2019s somewhat close to what the first public version of ChatGPT had when OpenAI launched it in the fall of 2022.",
      "The challenges of diverse dialects and complex grammar",
      "ChatGPT and other models like Google\u2019s Gemini have also sought in recent years to include a wider scope of data to offer the programs in languages other than English and with \u201clocalizations\u201d\u2014 such as the LLM knowing to respond in the metric system when relevant or to understand idioms.",
      "Those companies acknowledge the importance of expanding that offering. HyunJeong Choe, the director of engineering and internationalization for Google\u2019s Gemini Apps, said it\u2019s \u201ca dedicated experience\u201d that can be \u201cessential for cultural relevancy and sensitivity.\u201d",
      "But they also recognize it\u2019s a particularly complex endeavor, since most training data available to them is in English. \u201cThe intricacies of different languages can pose a significant obstacle for all AI models. ... Languages with complex grammar, diverse dialects or limited digital resources may be harder to train,\u201d Choe said.",
      "LatAmGPT,\u00a0through\u00a0its institutional networks\u00a0with libraries and archives, has somewhat skirted this issue \u2014 but not entirely. Dur\u00e1n Rojas said they\u2019re still struggling to incorporate Indigenous languages spoken by millions in the region because written documentation is not as widely available.",
      "But they're still aiming to try as they continuously perfect their model \u2014 though they stress the importance of collaboration.",
      "\u201cThe quality and attributes of the results we can get will depend on us as Latin Americans joining in to contribute as much as we can,\u201d said Vilches Meneses, the Lewis & Clark professor.",
      "Currently, with the tentative June launch date, LatAmGPT is still receiving data as collaborators regularly check in with specific questions to benchmark it in comparison to other available models.",
      "Among the questions they're testing are queries on the many different names and terms used in the region for a specific word like \"car,\" or a request for the GPT to make a comparison chart of how the region's countries have responded to mass immigration from\u00a0places like Venezuela.",
      "A large goal of LatAmGPT is to become familiar with these technological advances so they can be included in public policies and regulations, according to Dur\u00e1n Rojas.",
      "For that, the creation of the transcontinental network to help develop the project is key, and per Dur\u00e1n Rojas will likely remain so.",
      "\u201cThe most meaningful aspect, the greatest legacy, is this interconnectedness we\u2019ve found to strengthen and develop AI-based solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cThe model, I mean it\u2019s great that we\u2019re making it, but the collaboration \u2014 that\u2019s what will most impact how we build things going forward.\u201d",
      "And with that there is a growing opportunity to offer further contributions with a Latino touch.",
      "\u201cAt its base, this is jointly creating something from Latin America for Latin America and for the world, as proof to ourselves and to others that we can also produce high tech,\u201d Vilches Meneses said, \u201cand that we can contribute to knowledge of artificial intelligence while still employing our\u00a0social and cultural intelligence.\u201d",

      "Duonychus, which means \u201ctwo claws\u201d in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones and a long neck ending in a small head, and it was covered in down and quill-like feathers.",
      "\u201cIt kind of blew my mind,\u201d the lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal\u00a0iScience, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News. \u201cI felt this rush of excitement, like, \u2018Wait\u2026 am I actually looking at something completely new here?\u2019\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs were already the \u201cweirdest dinosaurs out there,\u201d Kobayashi said. \u201cDuonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It\u2019s like evolution said, \u2018Let\u2019s try something different,\u2019 and just ran with it.\u201d",
      "Therizinosaurs lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period,\u00a0145 million to 66 million years ago.",
      "Despite having only two claws, Duonychus was an \u201ceffective grasper\u201d that could reach branches or swaths of vegetation up to nearly 5 inches in diameter.",
      "\u201cDinosaurs weren\u2019t just stuck in one body plan \u2014 they were constantly experimenting, evolving, doing weird stuff,\u201d Kobayashi added, calling them \u201ctotal oddballs.\u201d",

      "The American-brokered deal for a maritime ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine looks little more than a dream Kremlin wish list and another example of President Donald Trump\u2019s handing concessions to Vladimir Putin, some Western analysts warned Wednesday.",
      "An American delegation has been negotiating separately with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to fulfill Trump\u2019s promise to quickly end the fighting in Eastern Europe. On Tuesday, the White House said it had reached an agreement with both parties for a truce over the Black Sea, a strategic body of water bordering Ukraine, Russia and four other countries, including Turkey, a major U.S. ally and NATO member.",
      "However, the terms of the tentative deal are enormously favorable for the Kremlin \u2014 with few upsides for Ukraine, according to many Russia watchers in Europe and the United States.",
      "\u201cIt is unsurprising that the Americans have agreed to most, if not all, of Russia\u2019s demands,\u201d because \u201cthe U.S. wants almost any deal,\u201d said James Nixey, head of the Russia-Eurasia program at the London think tank Chatham House. Washington \u201cis no longer an honest broker in these diplomatic negotiations,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause it clearly wishes to pursue the normalization of relations with Russia at the expense of Ukraine\u2019s demands, ambitions and desires.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The American delegation negotiated separately with the Ukrainian and Russian teams, with the White House releasing different statements afterward corresponding to each round of talks.",
      "Its statement relating to Ukraine said they had agreed to a ceasefire over the Black Sea while working toward halting attacks on energy infrastructure. That could stop the nightly fleets of Russian drones that pummel Ukraine\u2019s civilian power grid. But Ukrainian officials say it\u2019s more likely to benefit Russia by halting Kyiv\u2019s campaign of targeting oil refineries fueling the Kremlin\u2019s war.",
      "\u201cThese are really gifts to Russia,\u201d said Oleksii Tsymbalyuk, 50, a sergeant in the Ukrainian armed forces. He said it was \u201cdubious\u201d whether Russia would in, fact stop, bombing Ukraine\u2019s civilian power grid.",
      "Russia falsely claims it has already been honoring an energy-grid ceasefire since March 18. Dmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Tuesday that that showed that \u201cMoscow is a city built on lies\u201d and that \u201cthe Russians are lying even when the truth is obvious.\u201d",
      "Arguably an even bigger concession came in the White House statement relating to Russia, which said it would \u201crestore Russia\u2019s access to the world market\u201d for agricultural and fertilizer exports.",
      "\u201cThis agreement would basically drive a coach and horses through the present sanctions regime,\u201d Phillips O\u2019Brien, an international relations professor at Scotland\u2019s University of St. Andrews, wrote on Substack. \u201cAny Russian company that claimed to be working in \u2018agricultural and fertilizer\u2019 products would be allowed to ship goods in and out of Russia.\u201d",
      "Russia would also benefit far more from the maritime ceasefire itself, many experts say, because it has suffered most from Ukraine drone attacks on its historically powerful Black Sea Fleet.",
      "\u201cAs predicted. Trump rushes to give Putin everything he wants for nothing,\u201d Russian chess champion-turned-democracy campaigner Garry Kasparov wrote on X. \u201cNothing for the U.S., nothing for Ukraine, everything for Russia, which is still bombing Ukrainian civilians every day.\u201d",
      "Western military experts say Russia has less incentive to sign a ceasefire than Ukraine after Moscow\u2019s recent gains on the battlefield\u00a0and its sense that a more amenable president is now in the White House.",
      "As has been the case with previous rounds of negotiations, there were indications that the White House and the Kremlin did not share the same understanding of the details of the deal. A Kremlin readout Tuesday suggested that a firm agreement had not yet been reached. It said the Black Sea truce will go into force after a series of sanctions are lifted.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Russia was \u201csatisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing. This time, justice must prevail, and we will continue our work with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump was asked whether Putin was playing for time in an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt could be they\u2019re dragging their feet,\u201d Trump said, adding that he had \u201cdone it over the years\u201d when \u201cI don\u2019t want to sign a contract\u201d but \u201cI want to sort of stay in the game.\u201d Ultimately, he said, \u201cI think Russia would like to see it end. And I think Zelenskyy would like to see it end at this point.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the ceasefire might come into force \u2014 if it\u2019s practically workable at all.",
      "The Kremlin readout said it would begin only once international banking restrictions were lifted and Russia was reconnected to the vital SWIFT global financial payments system. Trump told reporters Tuesday that his team \u201cwill be looking at\u201d those stipulations.",
      "But agreeing to lift those sanctions, imposed after Putin invaded Ukraine three years ago, would require the cooperation of Europe. Unlike Trump\u2019s warming ties, Europe has remained steadfastly opposed to Putin.",
      "That sets up a potential flashpoint between Washington \u2014 eager to push through the deal \u2014 and Europe \u2014 most likely resistant to easing sanctions.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that Europeans don\u2019t fall for this U.S./Russian stitch-up, which will strengthen Russia, weaken Ukraine, and undermine the security of the rest of Europe,\u201d Ian Bond, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform think tank, wrote on the Bluesky social media platform.",
      "Zelenskyy said Tuesday evening that the ceasefire would begin immediately. But, he said, \u201cthere is no faith in the Russians\u201d to honor the agreement, and he suggested he would ask Trump for additional weapons and sanctions if it were breached.",
      "\u201cWe do not trust them. And frankly, the world doesn\u2019t trust Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must prove that they are truly ready to end the war, ready to stop lying to the world, stop lying to President Trump and stop lying to America.\u201d"
