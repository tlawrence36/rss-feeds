      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",

      "The couple announced their engagement on Aug. 26, 13 days after Swift's \"New Heights\" episode dropped. Fans were quick to speculate about when Kelce popped the question \u2014 and they didn't have to wait long before getting a timeline from Kelce's dad Ed, who told News 5 Cleveland that the couple got engaged roughly two weeks ago.",
      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",

    "summary": "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival, calling his participation \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly.",
      "The study, led by Stanford Medicine and published in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with ADHD.",
      "\"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy,\" explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children.",
      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",
      "\"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm,\" Howard said. \"It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention.\"",
      "The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.",
      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids.\"",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",

      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHC secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",

      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration.

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:42:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 21:10:18 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:56:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",

    "summary": "Persistent inflation remains a pain point for consumers \u2014 and for the Federal Reserve as it weighs whether to lower interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation continued to run hot in July, underlining the Federal Reserve's dilemma as it looks to lower prices for American consumers while propping up a job market that is starting to wobble.",
      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to personal consumption expenditures data released on Friday. That's the same figure as in June, a sign inflation remains persistent. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, inflation in July actually ticked up to 2.9% from a year ago, up from 2.8% in June.",
      "Read on for a breakdown of Friday's PCE report.",
      "How are consumers faring?",
      "The latest PCE data shows that consumer spending rose 0.5% in July, suggesting that Americans are continuing to open their wallets even in the face of economic uncertainty.",
      "But while people continue to spend, many consumers are increasingly having to make trade-offs on what they spend their money on, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Consumers are trying to push through \u2014 they're doing the best they can, but they're increasingly under pressure, and therefore they're being more cautious with discretionary outlets,\" he said. \"They travel less. They spend less on restaurants, spend more cautiously on transportation.\"",
      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, analysts say inflation could bare its teeth more in the coming months as U.S. tariffs start to trickle through the economy.",
      "\"We continue to expect tariffs to take a growing bite out of growth in real income and real consumer spending,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report.",
      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",
      "What does the latest inflation data mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "Most Wall Street analysts think the latest inflation figures keep the Fed on track to lower interest rates at its Sept. 16-17 meeting.",
      "\"Today's numbers on both the personal consumption, expenditure, and income and spending, were right down the middle of the fairway,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B. Riley Wealth. \"This leaves the door wide open for the Fed to cut rates in September, and likely again in October and in December.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-trump-attempt-remove-lisa-cook-federal-governor/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

    "summary": "Critics caution U.S. government equity stakes in American companies could lead to cronyism, distorted economics and bad deals for taxpayers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

      "The tax credit saves EV leaseholders an average of $208 a month spread across a 36-month lease, Edmund found in analyzing dealership transactions. Leasing has become the most common way consumers enter the EV market, according to the auto industry data provider, which found that leases made up 70% of all EV transactions in July.",
      "A $4,000 tax credit for used EVs also ends on Sept. 30.",
      "For most consumers, leasing an EV is a better bet than buying, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.",
      "\"If you've never tried this tech and want to dip your toe in the water instead of getting married to it,\" he said, noting that EVs tend to depreciate faster than gas-powered cars. \"That's because we know the tech will get better, and what you buy today won't be as good as what you get next year.\"",
      "The IRS is also giving consumers more wiggle room to claim the EV tax credit before it ends. Previously, eligibility was tied to a vehicle's delivery date. But the agency this month issued a notice clarifying that consumers are eligible for the credit if they sign a contract for a vehicle prior to Sept. 30 and make a payment, which can include putting money down or trading in a car \u2014 even if the vehicle isn't delivered until after that date.",
      "\"EVs fundamentally face an awareness issue, and if dealers and automakers don't get the word out, they risk disappointing customers who show up after September 30 only to find that the opportunity has passed,\" \u00a0Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' assistant vice president of insights, said in a statement.",

      "The analysis shows that while the job change rate \u2014 defined in this case as the total percentage of Bank of America customers who have changed employers \u2014 has edged up this year, Americans are much less to likely switch jobs than during the \"Great Resignation.\" That was the period during the pandemic when a massive wave of workers quit their jobs, motivated by better work opportunities and work-life balance. Over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021, according to Labor Department data.",

The upshot: As employers have pulled back in hiring, workers are hunkering down in their current jobs.",
      "\"It's possible that, again, tariffs and just general business uncertainty is playing a role in squeezing out some of the availability for people to switch jobs, which is why that rate is declining,\" said Taylor Bowley, an economist at Bank of America Institute and lead author of the report.",
      "The labor market slowed sharply in recent months. Accounting for government data revisions, the average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from average of 123,000 from January to April. The Labor Department will release the next jobs report on September 5.",

    "summary": "Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit challenging what her suit said is President Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove\" her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors puts the nation in uncharted legal waters, and may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to provide clarity on whether the move crosses a legal boundary, legal scholars expect.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to oust Cook comes after months of griping about the Fed, which he says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. But if her removal is allowed to stand \u2014 a question that will be decided by the courts \u2014 and the Senate confirms a replacement, it would mean Mr. Trump will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cook was named to the Fed Board by President Joe Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to serve a full 14-year term in September 2023, which is set to end in January 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was removing Cook from her post because of alleged mortgage fraud, though she has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense. The claims about Cook were made by Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who sent a\u00a0letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of\u00a0 taking out mortgages for properties in Michigan and Georgia in 2021 and claiming both would be used as her primary residence.",
      "Pulte alleged that Cook was fraudulently attempting to gain more favorable lending terms. He has also leveled allegations of mortgage fraud against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democrats who have been among the most prominent opponents of Mr. Trump. Both have denied the accusations.",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook has set off a legal battle that could end with the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. She filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging what the suit said is Mr. Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would [be] the first of its kind in the Board's history.\"",
      "\"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" her complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., states.",
      "The White House has defended Mr. Trump's move to terminate Cook from the Fed Board of Governors as within his lawful authority.",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Aggressive removals",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook is the latest in a string of removals of Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies, which have tested the bounds of his executive authority. He fired leaders of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, ousted commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and terminated officials sitting on the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Many of the firings have led to legal challenges. The officials removed from the boards have argued Mr. Trump violated federal laws that shield them from being removed at-will. Instead, Congress has said that the only grounds for their firings are inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The laws were meant to insulate independent federal agencies and decisions from political pressure.",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" But courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause.\" While not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, Cook argues in her lawsuit that it means instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or comparable misconduct.",
      "The question of what qualifies as good cause, and whether Cook's alleged actions rise to it, are likely to be key questions to be answered during litigation, said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If [the justices] interpret good cause, they'll have to do so with an eye to the power and purpose of the Federal Reserve System more generally, the powers of the system and the purpose of its independence. What is 'good cause' with respect to the service of a Fed governor?\" he said. \"If all President Trump is going to go with is these allegations regarding the governor's mortgage application before she was on the board, I have a hard time believing that constitutes good cause because it's really not germane to the duties of the governor while she was in office.\"",
      "The Supreme Court and the Fed",
      "In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause.",
      "In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "This year, in response to emergency appeals brought by ousted officials from the NLRB and the MSPB, which are multi-member bodies, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. Trump to fire those officials while their legal challenges move forward, even though Congress shielded them from being removed at will. But in a brief decision in that case that appeared to be 6-3, the Supreme Court's majority singled out the Fed.",
      "Two fired officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, raised concerns about the consequences of allowing their removals and whether that would call into question the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause removal protections. The court said it disagreed. Instead, it called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",
      "Writing in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority created a \"bespoke Federal Reserve exception,\" even though its independence \"rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on.\"",
      "\"The court in that language does not resolve the question. All the court is saying is that the Federal Reserve is different from the FTC or from the NLRB,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said. \"Yeah, it is different, but is it sufficiently different to mean that it's not subject to the same rule? The court doesn't say.\"",
      "The president's removal powers",
      "While Mr. Trump has sought to exert new levels of control over the executive branch, the Supreme Court has recognized narrow exceptions to the removal powers, allowing Congress to protect certain officials from being fired without cause.",
      "In a 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the court found that Congress can restrict the president's authority to remove multi-member commissions of experts who are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In its decision allowing the firings of the labor board members, the Supreme Court's majority said the Justice Department \"is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.\"",
      "But White said the Fed is different from those agencies because of the authority it exerts.",
      "\"Under the last 15 years of precedents, the question is what kind of powers does the agency wield and are they substantially executive?\" he said. \"And for the Fed, it does have regulatory powers and it's possible they verge on something like executive power, but the overwhelming majority of what the Fed does that is of consequence is its monetary powers. That's why the court recognized that the Fed is different.\"",
      "White continued: \"The whole reason why we're sensitive about the president's attacks on the Fed versus the NLRB is that the Fed's overwhelming purpose and its most significant power are all something very different than simple law enforcement policy. Those powers, going back to the very beginning of the country, have never been treated as executive powers.\"",
      "Alicea, however, disagreed. The Board of Governors has broad oversight and regulatory authority over the nation's banking system, he said.",
      "\"Those are core executive powers,\" he said.",

      "Cook filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, teeing up a legal showdown that seems destined to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Her legal team asked the district court to declare that Mr. Trump's attempted firing is \"unlawful and void\" and that Cook \"remains an active member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Governor Cook seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of Governors, safeguard her and the Board's congressionally mandated independence, and allow Governor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work,\" the suit said.",
      "Members of the Fed board are confirmed by the Senate and serve for 14-year terms. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president can only remove them early \"for cause.\" The law doesn't specify what qualifies as \"cause,\" and it has never been tested in court, but it is generally understood to be malfeasance.",
      "In her suit, Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen asked the court to state that Fed board members \"can only be removed for cause, meaning instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct,\" citing Supreme Court precedent and relevant federal law. Even if the court disagrees with that standard, they wrote, the law \"clearly does not support removal for policy disagreements.\"",
      "Powell and the Fed board are named in the suit because Cook asked the court for an injunction ordering them to \"refrain from effectuating President Trump's illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the president \"exercised his lawful authority\" in removing Cook.",
      "\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the past that the president has the legal right to remove at will members of federal boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Trump's power to fire some board members, but said in May that the Federal Reserve is a separate case, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage documents by claiming two homes that she bought in 2021 as her primary residence. He alleged that Cook \u2014 an economist who has served on the Fed board since 2022 \u2014 had committed mortgage fraud, and referred the matter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department special attorney Ed Martin.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump publicly called on Cook to resign.",
      "At the time, Cook didn't address the substance of Pulte's allegations directly, but said in a statement that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\" She added that she would \"take any questions about my financial history seriously\" and said she was gathering more information.",
      "Lowell, her lawyer, said Monday that Mr. Trump didn't have the legal right to fire Cook \"based solely on a referral letter\" to Justice Department leadership, a point her legal team reiterated in Thursday's lawsuit.",
      "\"[R]emoval 'for cause' requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on an unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to her Senate confirmation),\" the complaint said. \"And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular officer's official conduct in certain cases, 'cause' requires a factual basis supporting such asserted misconduct.\"",
      "The broadside against Cook came as Mr. Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank's rate-setting committee \u2014 which Cook and Powell both sit on \u2014 has opted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, fearing that inflation could resurge. Last week, Powell hinted that the central bank may cut rates soon, but it will \"proceed carefully.\"",
      "The president favors immediate rate cuts, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow money, though at the risk of causing higher inflation. He has floated firing Powell at various times over the past few months and has encouraged other Fed officials to overrule him and slash rates.",
      "The Fed typically makes interest rate decisions independently. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize the Fed for leaving rates high, but he's been unusually assertive. Last year, he argued he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "Many experts believe it's important for central banks to operate independently so they can make decisions based on economic data, not politics. If elected officials are in charge of monetary policy, they could opt for the politically popular short-term benefits of low interest rates \u2014 like a hotter economy and cheaper borrowing costs \u2014 even if that leads to higher inflation in the long run, Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel noted earlier this year.",
      "Kathryn  Watson and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The U.S. economy expanded faster between April and June than previously estimated, as growth bounced back after slumping in the first quarter, new government data shows.",
      "The Commerce Department said Thursday that the country's gross domestic product \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 grew at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter after shrinking 0.5% in the first three months of 2025. The agency had initially estimated second-quarter growth at 3%.",
      "\"There was an upward revision to business investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property, as well as consumer spending,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Investment related to AI is helping mask some of the weakness elsewhere in the economy, but the good news is that there is little sign that this support is set to fade anytime soon.\"",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP as businesses scrambled to bring in foreign goods ahead of new U.S. tariffs taking effect. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter. Imports fell at a 29.8% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "Concerns about the health of the economy have grown amid recent signs of a cooldown in hiring across the U.S., with employers adding a weaker than expected 73,000 jobs in July. Investors expect Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next policy meeting in September in a bid to shore up economic growth.",
      "\"While the US economy grew at an upwardly revised annualized rate of 3.3% in Q2 2025, the strength was largely a mirage, reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in response to tariffs in Q1,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "The economy grew at an average rate of only 1.4% in the first six months of the year, Daco noted, pointing to weak private-sector demand outside of an ongoing surge of investment in AI.",
      "According to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow forecasting tool, the economy is growing at 2.2% clip this year."

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",
      "The analysis reveals a similar pattern playing out in the following fields:",

      "Accounting and auditing",
      "Secretarial and administrative work",
      "Computer programming",
      "Sales",
      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Beyond deals with YouTube TV and others, Fox last week launched its own streaming platform, \"Fox One,\" which has a starting price of $19.99 a month.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/car-buying-mistakes-to-avoid-edmunds-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A 2025 analysis from Edmunds reveals that nearly 20% of new car buyers are committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a new car has never been more financially daunting. A 2025 analysis from Edmunds found that a record 19.3% of consumers who financed a new vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 committed to a monthly payment of $1,000 or more. That's nearly one in five buyers taking on what was once considered an extreme car payment \u2014 driven by high interest rates and rising vehicle prices.",
      "While it might be tempting to stretch your budget for the car you want, locking yourself into a high-cost loan can be a painful mistake. Before you sign, here are five common car-buying missteps to avoid.",
      "1. Buying outside your means",
      "There's a difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford it wisely. With an average new vehicle transaction price of approximately $49,000, many buyers are truly stretching their budgets. It's not uncommon to see buyers opt for extended 72-month or 84-month financing terms.",
      "That shiny SUV might seem within reach thanks to flexible financing, but the long-term hit to your financial health could be considerable. Buying within your means \u2014 ideally targeting a loan term of no more than 60 months and keeping your car-related expenses under 15%-20% of your monthly take-home pay \u2014 is smart shopping in an era of rising interest rates and ever-increasing car prices.",
      "2. Getting a dealership loan",
      "One of the most costly and common mistakes car buyers make is waiting until they're sitting in the dealership finance office to think about a loan. Dealerships may offer convenience, but their financing may include marked-up interest rates or hidden fees.",
      "Instead, walk into the dealership with a preapproved loan offer from your bank, credit union or an online lender. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this move can save buyers hundreds to thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. When you do this, the dealer can still try to beat the rate \u2014 and sometimes will. But now you're negotiating from a position of strength, not desperation.",
      "3. Trading in a car with negative equity",
      "If you owe more on your current car than it's worth \u2014 a situation known as negative equity \u2014 trading it in for a new vehicle can be a financial landmine. This commonly happens when people take out a six-year loan, trade in the vehicle after just three or four years, and carry the previous balance into the new vehicle. Rolling that deficit into a new loan just worsens the problem, guaranteeing that you'll be underwater for even longer.",
      "According to Edmunds, 28.2% of trade-ins in July 2025 involved negative equity, and the average amount buyers owed above the vehicle's value was $6,902. That sets the stage for a vicious cycle, especially if buyers trade cars frequently or face unexpected job loss or repair costs. If you're in this situation, consider keeping your car longer or making extra payments. If you can get a better rate, even refinancing can get you back to breakeven.",
      "4. Not working with internet sales team first",
      "Most major dealerships now have dedicated internet sales teams that exist to sell you a car quickly and often at better prices than you'll get face-to-face. If you already know what make, model and trim you want, you can save hours \u2014 and hundreds or even thousands of dollars \u2014 by working with the internet sales department instead of walking onto the lot.",
      "Sites such as Edmunds can help you compare pricing between multiple dealers, and many will show you real-time inventory, rebates and incentives. This lets you shop from the comfort of home and make dealers compete for your business. It also gives you a written quote you can bring with you \u2014 a powerful tool when negotiating.",
      "5. Overlooking used car options",
      "Buying new is tempting \u2014 it smells great, it's under warranty, and no one else has touched it. But it's not always the smartest financial move. Today's certified pre-owned vehicles often come with extended factory warranties, undergo rigorous inspections, and cost thousands less than their new counterparts. The rapid depreciation of most new vehicles only worsens the picture. Most lose 20%\u201330% of their value in the first year alone, according to Edmunds. Avoiding that depreciation hit can save thousands.",
      "Buying a new car is one of the biggest financial decisions most people make \u2014 second only to purchasing a home. Avoiding these five common mistakes won't just save you money \u2014 it has the potential to help ensure your long-term financial security. Take your time and do your homework. The right deal isn't just about the car \u2014 it's about the life you want to live after you drive it off the lot.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 15:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Cracker Barrel decided to scrap the new logo entirely and keep the original design. \"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the company\u00a0announced\u00a0on social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "The decision came after President Trump on Tuesday publicly urged the company to ditch the new logo. \"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "Much of the initial uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Cracker Barrel's stock price was up roughly 5% ahead of the start of trade on Wednesday, helping erase the company's earlier market loss.",
      "Tom Murphy, a branding expert and professor at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch that he thinks Cracker Barrel did the right thing in backtracking on its logo rollout.",
      "\"The decision by Cracker Barrel to return to its original logo is a positive course correction, given the intensity of emotional response from their core base of customers,\" he said. \"This gives them an opportunity to reinforce the fact that they are not moving away from their brand purpose or their heritage.\"",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts panned Cracker Barrel's attempt at overhauling its logo.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "According to a recent YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 76% of those polled said they prefer the company's old logo to the new one.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Murphy, the Clark University branding expert, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

      "A college diploma is no longer a sure ticket to a good-paying job. Yet some workers can earn six figures in a range of occupations without a bachelor's degree, a new study finds.",
      "Nearly 6 million full-time workers in the U.S. without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, according to a\u00a0report from loan marketplace Lending Tree, which analyzed the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. The study sheds light on some alternative pathways to a high-paying career that don't require a four-year degree.",
      "\"This report is pretty clear proof that you don't have to go to college to earn a really substantial income, and if you are considering a different route, there is plenty of reason to believe that in an awful lot of fields you can be every bit as successful, and every bit financially stable without that college degree,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 5.7 million, or 9%, of non-college graduates earning six-figure salaries worked in a range of fields, including software development, truck driving, elevator repair and more, according to the study. The report comes as many young people question the cost and value of a college degree, and evaluate whether the rewards are worth taking on the substantial student debt earning a degree often requires.",
      "Over the past 10 years, young workers without a bachelor's degree have seen their earnings increase, according to a 2024\u00a0study from the Pew Research Center. Amid rising tuition costs and mounting student debt, 29% of U.S. adults say the cost of college is not worth it, according to the research.",
      "The unemployment rate for young people who recently earned a college degree was close to 6% earlier this year, above the national average of 4.2%. That's in part because a growing number of employers are turning to artificial intelligence to perform tasks formerly done by entry-level workers, according to economists.",

      "Chief executives who never graduated from college were also on Lending Tree's list, with 64% earning at least six figures. To be sure, the study doesn't suggest that young workers should expect to ascend to executive-level positions without college degrees. Rather, the high share of non-college degree holders earning six figures as CEOs likely represents workers who have started their own businesses, according to Schulz.",
      "\"It speaks to the opportunity that can come from starting a small business today,\" he said. \"You're not necessarily talking about Fortune 500 companies.\"",

    "story": [
      "In a sign of home sellers' frustration over how long it's taking to find a buyer,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their property off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0by Realtor.com that finds that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",

      "The rich are different from other people \u2014 and that also applies to the share of their income they pay in taxes, according to a new study from University of California, Berkeley, economists.",
      "The individuals who make up the\u00a0Forbes 400 list, topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a fortune of $244 billion, paid an average effective tax rate of 24% from 2018 to 2020, compared with a 30% rate for all other U.S. taxpayers, the researchers said in a new paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The research comes as President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law on July 4, delivers its largest\u00a0benefits to the highest-earning Americans\u00a0through a mix of new and extended tax breaks. Those include raising the estate-tax exemption to $15 million per person, up from about $14 million.",
      "The changes build on an earlier tax cut \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Trump's signature first-term legislation. That 2017 law reduced the effective tax rate for the richest Americans from 30% to 24%, the researchers found.",
      "The new findings \u2014 from Berkeley economists and noted inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u2014 calculates the tax rate by tallying all income taxes, as well as corporate taxes that are paid by the companies owned by the richest Americans. In other words, it assigns a share of Amazon's corporate taxes to that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when calculating his total tax burden.",
      "\"The economic income of the wealthiest are essentially the profits of the businesses they own,\" Saez told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, and hence his true economic income is 10% of Amazon's profits.\"",
      "Corporate taxes are levies on the profits generated for Bezos, similar to how an employer withholds federal income and Social Security contributions from a worker's paycheck, he added.",
      "Saez and Zucman are leading proponents of instituting a U.S. wealth tax to help address widening inequality between the haves and have-nots. That idea has been embraced by some lawmakers, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "Some conservative critics have argued that wealth taxes could be self-defeating, with the Hoover Institute noting in a 2023 blog post that the levy could discourage entrepreneurship and investment.",
      "Research shows that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while cutting taxes for many individuals and businesses, hasn't had a significant impact on the economy, the Congressional Research Service found in an April report. Republican proponents of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, also\u00a0say\u00a0that it will boost the economy and provide tax relief to workers and families.",
      "How billionaires pay a smaller share",
      "U.S. income taxes are designed to be progressive, meaning that higher-earning workers pay a bigger share of their income to the IRS than people lower down the ladder. But because capital gains \u2014 the profits earned from selling stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets \u2014and business income are taxed at a lower rate than the top rate for income that people earn through their jobs, the richest Americans reap a massive tax break.",
      "For instance, the highest tax rate on earned income stands at 37%, which is assessed on every dollar earned above $609,351 for individual taxpayers. Yet that same person will pay only a 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains, such as profits from a stock sale, and a 21% corporate tax rate on income earned through a partnership or other business.",
      "And if the rich don't sell their shares, they don't have to pay any taxes on that wealth because they haven't realized a capital gain, Saez noted.",
      "\"The individual income tax is designed to be progressive thanks to its increasing tax rates by brackets, and it does a pretty good job except among the billionaire class,\" he said. \"As I said, the billionaire class can avoid realizing individual income and hence can escape the individual income tax.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked a Trump administration effort to expand fast-track deportations throughout the U.S. under a process known as expedited removal, indicating that officials are trampling on migrants' due process through the policy's expansion.",
      "While it will almost certainly be appealed, Friday's order is a major setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, including its campaign to arrest asylum-seekers at immigration courthouses across the U.S. \u2014 an operation that has relied on the expansion of expedited removal.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb paused a January directive that had expanded the expedited removal policy \u2014 long limited to border areas and recent arrivals \u2014 to anywhere in the country and to those who arrived in the past two years.",
      "Expedited removal allows federal immigration officials to quickly deport certain migrants, without allowing them to see an immigration judge, unless they claim asylum and pass an interview with a U.S. asylum officer. Before President Trump took office for a second time, the fast-track deportations only applied to unauthorized migrants apprehended within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Cobb said the pro-immigrant advocates who challenged the legality of the nationwide expansion of expedited removal had made a \"strong showing\" that the effort \"violates the due process rights of those it affects.\"",
      "\"In so holding, the Court does not cast doubt on the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, nor on its longstanding application at the border,\" Cobb wrote in her opinion. \"It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process. The procedures currently in place fall short.\"",
      "Cobb indefinitely postponed the January expansion of expedited removal, and guidance issued to implement it.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "Charles Borges, the chief data officer at the Social Security Administration, resigned Friday \u2014 days after filing a whistleblower complaint about\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0employees at the SSA.",
      "He said in the complaint that the DOGE employees had uploaded a copy of the entire country's Social Security information to a \"vulnerable cloud environment.\" Borges' resignation from the SSA was confirmed by the Government Accountability Project, which is providing his legal representation.",
      "A Social Security Administration spokesperson refuted the claim in a statement, saying that the data referenced had been \"walled off\" from the internet, and the SSA is \"not aware of any compromise to this environment.\"",
      "\"The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower court's injunction and cleared the way to allow DOGE to access sensitive Social Security information. Two labor unions and an advocacy group had filed a complaint claiming that allowing the access would violate the Privacy Act and a federal law. A lower court agreed with the plaintiffs and issued an injunction, and an appellate court also declined to lift the stay. Solicitor General D. John Sauer then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the injunction was forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "In Borges' resignation letter, sent Friday to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, he wrote that he was resigning involuntarily because of \"SSA's actions against me, which make my duties impossible to perform legally and ethically.\" He said his departure constituted a \"constructive discharge.\"",
      "Borges said in his letter that he has faced retaliation since he reported his concerns internally and subsequently submitted his whistleblower complaint. \"I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,\" he wrote.",
      "He alleged that \"newly installed leadership\" in the IT and executive offices at SSA \"created a culture of panic and dread, with minimal information sharing, frequent discussions on employee termination.\" And Borges claimed that repeated requests for visibility into activities he found questionable were \"rebuffed or ignored by agency leadership.\"",
      "Andrea Meza, a GAP attorney representing Borges, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Borges \"no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience given what he had witnessed.\" Meza said Borges \"will continue to work with the proper oversight bodies.\"",
      "Borges had served as SSA's chief data officer since January. Before that, he worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and was a White House Presidential Innovation fellow during the Biden administration, according to LinkedIn.

      "Asked about a possible military deployment to America's third-largest city, which was recently reported by The Washington Post, Pritzker told CBS News: \"It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2014 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed National Guard forces and federal agents to the streets of two other major cities \u2014 Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 in recent months, part of what the president casts as a crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "Last week, the president said his administration could take similar steps in Chicago. Mr. Trump called the city a \"mess\" and lashed out against Mayor Brandon Johnson, saying, \"We'll straighten that one out probably next.\"",

And The Washington Post has reported that the Pentagon is drawing up plans to potentially send thousands of National Guard members to the Midwest's largest metro area as early as September \u2014 though those plans haven't been publicly confirmed.",
      "Pritzker told CBS News that, if Mr. Trump sends the Guard to Chicago, voters \"should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime.\"",
      "The governor argued that the president's gambit may be part of a plan to \"stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\"",
      "He also called the idea \"an attack on the American people.\"",
      "\"Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No,\" Pritzker said in an interview with CBS News in Chicago.",

      "\"It's amazing the lengths this slob will go to in order to deflect from the terrible crime crisis that has been plaguing Chicago for years,\" Jackson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Chicago's residents would be much safer if Pritzker actually did his job and addressed his crime problem instead of trying to be a Resistance Lib hero.\"",
      "The Guard deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. have drawn stiff pushback from elected officials who argue local police are better able to handle crime, and warn the presence of federal agents and military personnel could inflame tensions.",
      "Future military deployments could also draw legal challenges. While Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard outright, the governors of the 50 states typically control their own Guard forces except in certain circumstances.",
      "The Trump administration deployed thousands of California National Guard members to Los Angeles over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections in June, arguing they were necessary to protect federal immigration agents and facilities from tense protests in the city.",
      "The state of California sued the administration, calling the deployment illegal. An appeals court found that Mr. Trump likely did have the legal authority to call up the state's National Guard, under a law that lets the president call Guard forces into federal service during a \"rebellion\" or if he isn't able to \"execute the laws of the United States.\" A lower court is still reviewing whether military forces in Los Angeles were inappropriately used for law enforcement purposes.",

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors in D.C. filed charges against a veteran who burned an American flag outside the White House, after President Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate flag burning.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in D.C. filed criminal charges against a man who burned an American flag outside of the White House earlier this week, after President Trump signed an executive order ordering the Justice Department to investigate flag burning.",
      "Jan Carey, 54, of North Carolina, is facing two misdemeanor criminal counts in Washington, D.C., federal court. Neither charge focuses on the fact that he burned a flag, specifically: one of the counts was for lighting a fire \"not in a designated area and receptacle,\" and another was for lighting a fire \"in a manner that threatened, caused damage to, and resulted in the burning of property, real property, and park resources.\"",
      "Both charges are punishable by a fine or no more than six months in custody.",
      "In a video of the flag burning captured by WUSA9\u00a0on Monday, Carey identified himself as a military veteran and said he was protesting the executive order.",
      "In an interview with WUSA9, Carey said he \"immediately thought I need to go burn a flag in front of the White House and let's put this to the test.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to investigate people who burn the American flag, even though the Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that the First Amendment protected symbolic speech, including flag burning.",
      "Mr. Trump's order attempts to navigate around the Supreme Court ruling. It said federal prosecutors should prioritize bringing cases against instances of flag burning that violate other \"content-neutral laws,\" and said the high court didn't rule out charges if burning a flag \"is likely to incite imminent lawless action\" or amounts to \"fighting words.\"",
      "The president has long pushed for criminal prosecutions for burning an American flag, suggesting in 2016 that it should be punished by \"loss of citizenship or year in jail.\"",
      "\"You burn a flag, you get one year in jail. You don't get 10 years, you don't get one month,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"You get one year in jail, and it goes on your record, and you will see flag burning stopping immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's order also calls for Attorney General Pam Bondi to litigate a challenge to the 1989 ruling, potentially getting the issue in front of a Supreme Court bench that is far more conservative than the high court was at the time of the original decision. And it suggests alleged flag burners could be charged with inciting a riot.",
      "Carey, however, was not charged with incitement.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Carey for comment.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats will be trying to take control of the Senate in the midterm elections next year, eyeing a handful of competitive races and a couple of long-shot bids.",
      "Over a third of the Senate's seats are up for election in 2026 \u2014 Democrats will be defending 13 seats, while Republicans will be trying to hold onto 24. But the map offers few opportunities for Democrats to flip seats, with many of the Republicans seeking reelection hailing from states that President Trump comfortably won in 2024. Meanwhile, the retirement of three Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 has created possible openings for the GOP.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in some competitive states, while flipping four seats in order to secure a majority.",
      "The key races likely to determine who controls the Senate after 2026 are beginning to take shape, with contentious primary challenges in some states and newcomers to watch in a handful of open seats in the upper chamber.",
      "North Carolina is expected to hold the most expensive contest, while Texas is seeing a bitter GOP primary fight that Democrats hope will play to their advantage.",
      "Here's what to know about the state of play in the key 2026 Senate races:",
      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.",
      "President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race \u2014 with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",
      "Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history.",
      "The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",
      "With the race's implications for control of the Senate, along with the presence of two well-connected candidates with fundraising chops, advertising spending is likely to surge.",
      "Georgia",
      "Widely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat this election cycle, Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term in the Senate after he eked out a win in the 2020 elections when the Georgia race went to a runoff.",
      "Ossoff's narrow victory secured a Democratic majority in the Senate, at the same time Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.",
      "With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate.",
      "New Hampshire",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she won't seek reelection, opening up what could be a competitive race in the Granite State.",
      "Though Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2017, a Republican hasn't carried New Hampshire in a presidential election since 2000, and the state last elected a Republican to the Senate in 2010. Still, Republicans have put up a number of formidable challenges in the state in recent years, and the GOP is aiming to capitalize on the open seat this cycle.",
      "On the Republican side, former Sen. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013, launched a bid to represent New Hampshire in the Senate after falling short against Shaheen in 2014. State Sen. Dan Innis, who launched two unsuccessful House bids, is also running. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a bid earlier this year, despite having the president's support.",
      "Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who's represented New Hampshire in the House since 2019, announced a bid for Shaheen's seat in April and quickly earned her endorsement. In early August, Karishma Manzur, a medical scientist, became the first Democrat to challenge Pappas in the primary.",
      "Michigan",
      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters' surprise\u00a0announcement\u00a0in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 opened up a key seat in the battleground state, which has flipped in the presidential races between President Trump in 2016 to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and back to Mr. Trump in 2024.",
      "Without the advantage traditionally provided by an incumbent, Democrats are drawing from a wide talent pool, with a crowded primary already underway. Though Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg considered entering the race, he ultimately passed on a bid earlier this year. Among the Democrats who have entered the race so far are Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Michigan health official Abdul El-Sayed. In Michigan, which has the largest concentration of Arabs in the U.S., Israel's war in Gaza is expected to become a key issue in the primary.",
      "On the GOP side, former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers also launched a bid earlier this year, after falling short in his race against Sen. Elissa Slotkin last year. Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed\u00a0the Army veteran last month, saying that from \"the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "Maine",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection in 2026. First elected to the Senate in 1996, the five-term senator is among the most independent-minded in the GOP caucus, often breaking with her party. She's survived a handful of challenges from Democrats in previous races, but it remains to be seen whether the 72-year-old can fend off a Democratic challenge in a state that Kamala Harris won in 2024 by almost seven points.",
      "Democrats have been trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, a 77-year-old two-term governor, in an attempt to unseat Collins. The entrance of a political newcomer in Democrat Graham Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer who has billed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, could complicate things for the party.",
      "Texas",
      "Although the Texas Senate race isn't expected to be as competitive in the general election, the Republican primary has been heating up in recent months as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenges Sen. John Cornyn for his long-held seat in the upper chamber.",
      "Cornyn, 73, has been in the Senate since 2002 and served as the No. 2 Republican from 2013 to 2019. Paxton, a 62-year-old staunch ally of the president, has criticized Cornyn for questioning whether Mr. Trump could win a general election in 2024. And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far \u2014 and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement. Asked this week about an endorsement in the race, Mr. Trump remained undecided, telling reporters, \"I'll make up my mind, I like them both.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\"",
      "On the Democratic side, former Rep. Colin Allred is pursuing another Senate bid after falling short against Sen. Ted Cruz by more than eight points last year. Allred is expected to face another uphill battle in 2026, but Democrats see his chances as improving, should the more conservative Paxton win the primary.",
      "Ohio",
      "Former Sen. Sherrod Brown's announcement this month that he is launching a comeback bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate marked a major recruiting victory for Democrats, though the Ohio race is still expected to be a tough battle for the party.",
      "Brown lost his 2024 bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno in a cycle that saw the president win in the state by more than 10 percentage points. Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points. And with the party that controls the White House typically losing ground in midterm elections, Democrats see a chance to flip the seat, forcing Republicans to spend heavily in the state in the process.",
      "In 2026, Brown will face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who previously served as Ohio's lieutenant governor and was appointed in January to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated.",
      "Minnesota",
      "Democratic Sen. Tina Smith announced in February that she wouldn't seek reelection in 2026, creating an open Senate seat in Minnesota for the first time since 2008.",
      "Though the North Star State hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002 and the GOP hasn't carried the state in a presidential election since the 1970s, the Republicans saw the state shift toward their direction in 2024, and they aim to capitalize on that in the race for the open seat in 2026.",
      "Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Adam Schwarze, a retired NAVY Seal, also launched a bid for the open seat earlier this year.",
      "Iowa",
      "Two-term Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, who was to be up for reelection in Iowa in 2026, is expected to announce in early September she will not run again.",
      "Ernst, a 55-year-old who was elected to the Senate in 2014, faced criticism from Democrats over\u00a0comments\u00a0she made about Medicaid cuts, and she was hammered by the GOP base over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "But a Democrat would face steep odds in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024. The Hawkeye State hasn't sent a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.",
      "The Democratic field is crowded, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, vying for the nomination. State Rep. J.D. Scholten had also launched a campaign, but he bowed out earlier this month and endorsed Turek.",
      "Nebraska",
      "In July, independent Dan Osborn announced another bid to represent Nebraska in the Senate, after falling short against Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven points in 2024.",
      "After the unexpectedly competitive race last year where he significantly outperformed Harris, the union leader is challenging GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts in 2026. But Republicans are expected to be better prepared for the challenge in the deep red state this time around.",
      "Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed to the Senate in 2023, upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's retirement, and handily won his bid in a special election last year to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term.",

      "The first Black mayor of a tiny Alabama town overwhelmingly won election this week, four years after he says White residents locked him out of the town hall and refused to let him serve.",
      "Incumbent Mayor Patrick Braxton was elected as the mayor of Newbern, winning 66 votes to his opponent's 26, according to results posted by the town. His victory puts a punctuation mark in the dispute over control of the town government that drew national attention.",
      "\"The people came out and spoke and voted. Now, there ain't no doubt what they want for this town,\" Braxton said in a telephone interview Wednesday night.",
      "The election Tuesday was the town's first since at least the 1960s, held under a federal settlement. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town's \"hand-me-down governance\" and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020.",
      "Newbern's residents number just 133 people. A library, the town hall, a mercantile and a flashing caution light anchor the downtown, about 40 miles west of Selma.",
      "What the town had been without is elections.",
      "Newbern's mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held \"hand-me-down\" positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others and reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The result was an overwhelmingly White government in a town where Black residents outnumber White residents 2-1. Only one Black person ever served on the town council.",
      "Braxton, a volunteer firefighter, qualified in 2020 to run for the nonpartisan position of mayor. He said that he ran because he had \"concerns that the Town Council and Mayor were not responding to the needs of the majority Black community\" in Newbern. In his lawsuit, he alleged that the previous mayor gave him the wrong information about how to run for the office.",
      "Braxton was the only candidate for mayor in 2020, becoming mayor-elect without an election. He alleged that previous town leaders did not provide public notice about the election. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done. Braxton asked both Black and White residents to serve, but no White residents agreed to join his council, according to the lawsuit.",
      "But the locks were changed at the town hall multiple times, and Braxton was denied access to the town's financial accounts. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and \"fraudulently reappointed themselves as the town council.\"",
      "\"I didn't get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,\" said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle.",
      "Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton's claim to be mayor was \"invalid.\"",
      "The settlement agreement included a promise to hold a mayoral election in 2025.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

      "The 9th Circuit panel found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the department had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior TPS extension because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit for it.",
      "\"In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,\" the court wrote.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration overstepped its authority in terminating the protections and were motivated by racial animus in doing so. Chen ordered a freeze on the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.",
      "It is unclear what effect Friday's ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. Protections for another group of 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.",
      "Congress authorized temporary protected status as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other \"extraordinary and temporary conditions\" that prevent a safe return to that home country.",
      "In ending the protections, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is looking to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved, deploying a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission to withhold funding without lawmakers' authorization.",
      "The move has prompted bipartisan pushback from Capitol Hill, with one top Republican calling it \"unlawful.\"",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson posted on X by the White House Office of Management and Budget, the president said he was proposing \"15 rescissions of budget authority, totaling $4.9 billion.\" The cuts include funding for the State Department as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development and international development and assistance programs.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously tried to nix foreign aid Congress has already approved, and lawmakers voted to go along with the cuts in July. But Mr. Trump's pocket rescission is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally. OMB insists this move is within the president's power.",
      "\"For the first time in nearly 50 years, the president is using his authority under the Impoundment Control Act to deploy a pocket rescission, cancelling $4.9 billion in woke and weaponized foreign aid money that violates the president's America first priorities,\" an OMB spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Under the Impoundment Control Act, the president can propose rescissions of budget authority, which Congress has 45 legislative days to approve. But if proposals are made late in the fiscal year, the funds can effectively be withheld until they expire. The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The last pocket rescission occurred in 1977, according to the Government Accountability Office, Congress's nonpartisan watchdog agency.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine and chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, immediately pushed back against the president's plan to not spend money that lawmakers approved.",
      "\"Given that this package was sent to Congress very close to the end of the fiscal year when the funds are scheduled to expire, this is an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval,\" Collins said in a statement, adding that the GAO \"has concluded that this type of rescission is unlawful and not permitted by the Impoundment Control Act.\"",
      "\"Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse,\" she said. \"Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.\"",
      "In a decision in 2018, the GAO concluded that the Impoundment Control Act \"does not permit the impoundment of funds through their date of expiration.\" An OMB official pointed to a\u00a0GAO decision from 1975 that found funding in a proposed rescission lapsed at the end of the fiscal year under the ICA, noting that GAO had proposed changes to the law that Congress has not adopted.",
      "Mr. Trump's pocket rescission appears to raise the chances of a government shutdown at the end of September, when funding for federal agencies expires. Sixty votes are needed in the Senate to approve spending bills, meaning Republicans will need the votes of at least seven Democrats to avoid a shutdown.",
      "The administration reneging on previously passed spending threatens to erode Democrats' confidence that any deal they reach with Republicans would be honored by the White House. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York hinted at that dynamic in a statement, saying the president and his Republican allies are \"hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall.\"",
      "\"Reasonable Republicans don't have to go along with the madness; Republicans don't have to be a rubber stamp for this carnage. Democrats stand ready to work with anyone to help American families, lower health care costs and secure our communities,\" Schumer said. \"But if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won't be party to their destruction.\"",

Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-intel-stake-consertatives-economists-response/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 06:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Critics caution U.S. government equity stakes in American companies could lead to cronyism, distorted economics and bad deals for taxpayers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

      "O'Neill previously worked in the orbit of Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and GOP megadonor. He served as CEO of the nonprofit Thiel Foundation, and he co-founded the Thiel Fellowship, a scholarship program that offers $200,000 to college-age entrepreneurs who agree to stay out of school, according to his HHS bio.

      "The CDC has had a tumultuous few months, marked by hundreds of layoffs and sweeping changes spearheaded by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has questioned the COVID-19 shots and promoted discredited theories linking certain childhood vaccines to autism. Kennedy fired every member of the CDC's independent vaccine advisory panel earlier this year.",
      "There has been friction between Kennedy and Monarez \u2014 who has said vaccines \"absolutely save lives\" \u2014 over the health agency's approach to vaccines, CDC officials told CBS News.",
      "The agency is also still grappling with a shooting outside its headquarters earlier this month. Police said the gunman harbored \"discontent with the COVID-19 vaccinations.\"",

      "Since Friday, his lawyers say federal officials have \"attacked Mr. Abrego in the media in numerous highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements,\" which they argue violates his right to a fair trial.",

      "The ruling is the latest in a long-running lawsuit seeking to hold the Saudi government liable for al Qaeda's attacks, a case that has been described by lawyers for the plaintiffs as a \"labyrinth.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia had the suit temporarily dismissed in 2015, before the dismissal was overturned by a federal appeals court. While the appeal was pending in 2016, Congress enacted a law known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which allowed victims of terror attacks to sue foreign governments and individuals if they provided material support to the attackers. It also gave U.S. courts jurisdiction over potential lawsuits filed over injuries and deaths in attacks on U.S. soil.",
      "Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years. The claims have drawn vehement denials from Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Most theories have centered on two of the 19 hijackers: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who were on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.",
      "More than a year before the hijackings, al-Midhar and al-Hazmi settled in Los Angeles, where a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi helped them find an apartment. A 2004 report by the 9/11 Commission said that Bayoumi met the two hijackers by chance at a restaurant.",
      "But the families of some victims and their attorneys have alleged that Bayoumi had deeper connections to Saudi Arabia, citing federal reports declassified in recent years that allege he had \"extensive ties\" with the Gulf monarchy's government and was accused of serving as a Saudi intelligence officer. The FBI has also investigated whether the two hijackers got assistance from Fahad al-Thumairy, an accredited Saudi diplomat and imam at a Los Angeles mosque. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that Thumairy helped the hijackers.",
      "Last year, a \"60 Minutes\" report revealed new evidence about Bayoumi, including a video of him filming the entrances of the U.S. Capitol and pointing out its location relative to the Washington Monument, at some points referencing a \"plan.\" Investigators have long believed the Capitol may have been the intended target of Flight 93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers overtook the hijackers.",
      "Decades ago, investigators also found a notebook in Bayoumi's home that seemed to show a drawing of a plane and a mathematical equation that could be used to calculate the rate of descent to a target.",
      "Many of those allegations were raised by attorneys for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Lawyers for the Saudi government have repeatedly pushed for all claims against the country to be dismissed, arguing the court lacks jurisdiction, including in October 2023. A Manhattan judge rejected that request Thursday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have managed to provide this Court with reasonable evidence as to the roles played by Bayoumi, Thumairy, and KSA, in assisting the hijackers. KSA did not proffer sufficient evidence to the contrary,\" U.S. District Judge in the Southern District of New York George Daniels wrote in an order Thursday. \"Although KSA attempts to offer seemingly innocent explanations or context, they are either self-contradictory or not strong enough to overcome the inference that KSA had employed Bayoumi and Thumairy to assist the hijackers.\"",
      "Daniels wrote that while the families and attorneys representing Saudi Arabia disagree on Bayoumi's motive, it is \"undisputed\" that Bayoumi assisted in finding the hijackers' apartments, and signed a lease with them as a guarantor. Daniels said it is also \"undisputed\" that a notepad page \"with an airplane drawing, notes, and numbers\" was found in Bayoumi's home.",
      "Attorneys representing Saudi Arabia, Daniels wrote, argued that \"Bayoumi's encounters with the hijackers were coincidences,\" and he was \"simply being good-natured\" when he provided assistance to the hijackers. The lawyers, Daniels said, claimed the airplane drawing \"was unrelated to the 9/11 Attacks\" and \"likely related to Bayoumi's son's high school [assignments].\"",
      "\"These are all either conclusory attorney speculations not grounded in facts, or self-serving denials or excuses from Bayoumi himself that do not withstand scrutiny,\" Daniels wrote.",
      "The Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., said the country \"respectfully disagrees with the decision, believes it has solid grounds for appeal, and intends to pursue such an appeal.\" It also noted that Saudi Arabia \"categorically denies\" the plaintiffs' allegations about the country, and Thursday's ruling focuses on the issue of jurisdiction, not the merits of the case.",
      "\"We welcome the court's thorough and well-reasoned decision and look forward to moving the case forward to trial,\" Sean P. Carter, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement.",
      "Kreindler & Kreindler LLP, another law firm representing Sept. 11 victims' families, said the ruling \"ensures that the plaintiffs may continue their long pursuit of truth and justice,\" and \"paves the way for these critical issues to be fully examined at trial.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting next month amid a slew of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee announced a hearing next Thursday with Secretary Kennedy on President Trump's health care agenda. The proceeding was previously in the works prior to controversy, according to a committee aide, who noted the panel does not have jurisdiction over the CDC.",
      "A handful of congressional Democrats have called for Kennedy to resign or be fired over the mass exodus from the health agency.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has begun moving detainees out of a controversial, state-run immigration detention center in the middle of the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" days after a federal judge ruled that parts of the facility must be dismantled.",
      "The detainees are being transferred to other immigration detention centers, DHS said in a statement Wednesday, blaming a court order from an \"activist judge\" that it called \"another attempt to prevent the President from fulfilling the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst.\"",
      "\"DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "In an email to a South Florida rabbi last week that CBS News obtained, a top Florida emergency official wrote that Alligator Alcatraz would likely be empty \"within a few days.\"\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0first reported the email on Wednesday.",
      "The Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a statement that \"[t]he mission has not changed, deportations will continue, and Florida will remain at the forefront of the nation's immigration enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"'Alligator Alcatraz' is a temporary deportation facility; the detainees who are delivered there will all be returned to their home countries,\" the agency said. \"This was ALWAYS the facility's intent: to expedite the deportation process and support the President's immigration initiative.\"",
      "The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.",
      "Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.",
      "The administration has cast \"Alligator Alcatraz\" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys \u2014 allegations that federal and state officials have denied.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.",
      "The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.",
      "Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.",
      "In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present \"new evidence\" showing the detainees at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\"Alligator Alcatraz\" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially. A federal judge earlier this month dismissed one part of the suit that alleged the government had prevented detainees from filing legal challenges by not making clear which immigration court oversaw the facility, but he left the rest of the suit intact \u2014 though he moved the case from Miami to Orlando.",
      "Another lawsuit filed last week alleges the state of Florida does not have the legal authority to operate an immigration detention center.",

      "The Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0announced in an X post\u00a0Wednesday that Monarez no longer leads the CDC. Reports on her ouster were immediately followed by a dispute between the administration and her attorneys regarding whether she had been legally fired, with lawyers for Monarez arguing she's still in charge of the CDC and only President Trump can fire her.",
      "It's not clear why Monarez was removed from the job \u2014 but several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, often citing disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, budgets cuts to the agency, and what one described as the \"weaponization of public health.\"",
      "Prominent D.C.-based attorney Mark Zaid said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Monarez \"has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she was fired.\" He said that he and lawyer Abbe Lowell are representing Monarez.",
      "Zaid alleged that Monarez was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai alleged in response that Monarez was terminated because she \"refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so.\"",
      "\"As her attorney's statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again,\" Desai said in response to Zaid's initial statement.",
      "Hours later, Zaid and Lowell said Monarez was told of her firing Wednesday night by a \"White House staffer in the personnel office.\" In a statement to CBS News, they called the move \"legally deficient\" and argued that she remains the leader of the CDC because, as a presidential appointee, \"only the president himself can fire her.\"",
      "On Monday, Monarez had to cancel an agency-wide meeting because she had been summoned to Washington, D.C., according to CDC officials.",
      "In its\u00a0X post, HHS thanked Monarez \"for her dedicated service for the American people,\" and said Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"has full confidence in his team\" at the CDC.",
      "At least three other senior CDC leaders have resigned from the agency, according to resignation emails obtained by CBS News.",
      "Daniel Jernigan, who led the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, told colleagues he was leaving due to \"the current context in the Department.\" The CDC's Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry and the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Demetre Daskalakis, also announced their departures.",
      "Houry's message to CDC staffers warned about the \"rise of misinformation\" about vaccines. She also argued planned cuts to the agency's budget will hurt the CDC.",
      "\"For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations,\" wrote Houry, who worked at the CDC for over a decade. \"Vaccines save lives\u2014this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact.\"",
      "Daskalakis said in a note to CDC staff: \"I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.\"",
      "Daskalakis also posted on X a resignation letter addressed to Houry, in which he criticized recent changes to vaccine recommendations and warned of an \"intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines.\" He also said Kennedy and his staff's views \"challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency.\"",
      "\"Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people,\" Daskalakis wrote.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, who serves on the Senate health committee, reacted to Monarez's ouster by calling for Kennedy to be fired, calling him \"a dangerous man who is determined to abuse his authority to act on truly terrifying conspiracy theories and disinformation.\"",
      "\"If there are any adults left in the White House, it's well past time they face reality and fire RFK Jr,\" Murray said in a statement.",

      "The sudden departures come at a tumultuous time for the public health agency. Staff are\u00a0still reeling\u00a0from an early August\u00a0shooting\u00a0outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters by a gunman who police said was upset about COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 also fired every member of an independent CDC panel tasked with making vaccine recommendations. During Kennedy's tenure, HHS has made other moves on vaccines that have troubled public health and infectious disease experts. Kennedy halted contracts for mRNA vaccine research earlier this month, and the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and people with health conditions, but not for healthy adults and children.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC faced hundreds of layoffs this year.",
      "There has been some friction between Monarez and Kennedy over COVID-19 vaccines and the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, CDC officials told CBS News. Monarez has publicly said that vaccines \"save lives.\" The Trump administration was also unhappy with the way she had talked about the Atlanta shooting and stopped her from publishing an op-ed about the incident, the officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0nominated Monarez\u00a0to lead the CDC in late March,\u00a0calling her\u00a0a \"dedicated public servant\" who could repair what he called a loss of public confidence in the CDC \"due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement.\" Monarez was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0in a party-line vote in late July, after previously serving as the agency's\u00a0acting head\u00a0starting in January.",
      "She was nominated to lead the agency after Mr. Trump\u00a0pulled his initial pick\u00a0for the job, former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon, a physician who was controversial in part due to his past skepticism of vaccines. In private meetings with Weldon, some Republican senators and their staffers grew concerned that he seemed unfamiliar with the CDC's operations,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0reported at the time.",
      "Monarez\u00a0holds a Ph.D.\u00a0in microbiology and immunology, though unlike\u00a0most\u00a0prior CDC directors, she is not a medical doctor. She previously served as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, a federal agency that backs advanced medical research. She also worked in the Obama-era White House's science and technology office and the Department of Homeland Security during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "During her Senate confirmation hearing, Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations. Kennedy has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and said she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",

      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",

      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",
      "Earlier this year, officials announced that a piece of fossilized vomit, dating back to when dinosaurs roamed the earth, was discovered in Denmark.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Running two days late, SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday, chalking up what appeared to be a remarkably successful test flight in the wake of three back-to-back failures earlier this year.",
      "While reentry heating damaged a protective \"skirt\" around the engines of the upper stage Starship, along with partially melting a control flap near its hinge, the vehicle remained under control throughout and made it all the way to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned.",
      "\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting tenth flight test of Starship!\" SpaceX said in a post on X.",
      "Earlier, the Super Heavy first stage also performed as planned, boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, then flying itself back toward the Texas Gulf Coast for splashdown.",
      "In a test, one of three engines used during a powered descent was deliberately shut down, but the booster compensated and the rocket, falling tail-first, dropped into the Gulf as planned.",
      "SpaceX workers in Texas and California cheered and applauded major milestones throughout the one-hour, six-minute test flight, expressing their obvious elation after three catastrophic failures in a row leading up to Tuesday's 10th test flight.",
      "The mission began when the Super Heavy's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "The success of Tuesday's flight will not ease those concerns \u2014 a multitude of technical hurdles remain \u2014 but it was no doubt a shot in the arm for company founder Elon Musk and the SpaceX workforce.",
      "The initial stages of the test flight went smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when an engine used for landing was deliberately shut down to simulate a failure. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, a milestone the three previous test flights failed to achieve.",
      "Over the next 38 minutes or so, the Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and briefly reignited one of the rocket's six Raptor engines to verify its ability to restart in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, new heat shield tiles were put to the test while cameras and other sensors monitored how the fierce heat of reentry affected various structures.",
      "A protective skirt around the base of the engine compartment appeared to break apart as the heating intensified and at least one flap, used to control the Starship's orientation in the atmosphere, appeared to partially melt near a hinge connecting it to the fuselage.",
      "But it appeared to work normally throughout, flipping back and forth on computer command as the flight computer executed a series of tests.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead descended to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The company positioned a camera buoy in the area before launch, and it captured fleeting views of the big rocket, its skin blistered as expected during reentry, falling tail-first to an on-target rocket-powered \"landing.\" It then broke up and exploded, but that was expected with a water landing.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",

      "For the second time in a row, SpaceX was forced to call off an attempt to launch its giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket on the program's 10th test flight, a milestone mission to demonstrate fixes and upgrades in the wake of three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",
      "Multiple upgrades are also in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which were able to complete their mission.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture.

That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",

We'll do our very best for all the science that's now aboard. Also, we very much appreciate the resupply.\"",
      "Along with delivering fresh food, crew supplies, experiments and station hardware, the Dragon also brought an add-on thruster kit in its open trunk section that will be used to help boost the space station's altitude to offset the ongoing effects of passage through the extreme upper atmosphere.",

      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",

      "SpaceX early Sunday launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station, sending up a Dragon capsule loaded with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies along with an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the lab's altitude.",
      "Perched atop a workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, commercial resupply mission 33 got underway with a sky-lighting launch from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 2:45 a.m. ET, climbing away on a northeasterly trajectory lined up with the space station's orbit.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, moments after the discarded first-stage booster safely landed on an offshore droneship, the Dragon was released from the rocket's second stage, kicking off a 29-hour rendezvous with the orbiting laboratory complex.",
      "If all goes well, the cargo ship will move in for docking at the station's forward port at 7:30 a.m. Monday. On board: more than 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, 1,300 pounds of space station hardware, computer equipment and spacewalk gear.",
      "The food includes the usual variety of fresh, asked-for items for the crew, including coffee, tea and more than 1,500 tortillas.",
      "\"We fly tortillas because ... other breads and things like that have too many crumbs and things of that nature (that float away in weightlessness), so you can't actually maintain it in orbit,\" said Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager. \"Tortillas are a great substitute for that.\"",
      "On a more significant note, Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the space station, noted that NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November.",
      "During that quarter century, she said, \"we've hosted more than 280 residents, we've enabled more than 4,000 different ... scientific experiments and technology demonstrations (representing) the work of over 5,000 researchers from over 110 countries around the world.\"",
      "The CRS-33 mission will bring 50 research projects to the lab, including a new study of the effects of microgravity on bone loss, a 3D metal printer to assess the capability for manufacturing spare parts and tools on demand in space, and an experiment to study the effectiveness of 3D \"bioprinting.\"",
      "\"This investigation ... is looking to create a 3D-printed implantable medical device that can support nerve regrowth after injury by bridging the gap to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration,\" Parris said.",
      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",
      "The analysis reveals a similar pattern playing out in the following fields:",

      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

    "summary": "Court documents allege ChatGPT encouraged a 16-year-old boy to plan a \"beautiful suicide\" and keep it a secret from his loved ones.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said the company will make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the family of Adam Raine in San Francisco's Superior Court alleges that ChatGPT encouraged the 16-year-old to plan a \"beautiful suicide\" and keep it a secret from his loved ones. His family claims ChatGPT engaged with their son and discussed different methods Raine could use to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI creators knew the bot had an emotional attachment feature that could hurt vulnerable people, the lawsuit alleges, but the company chose to ignore safety concerns. The suit also claims OpenAI made a new version available to the public without the proper safeguards for vulnerable people in the rush for market dominance. OpenAI's valuation catapulted from $86 billion to $300 billion when it entered the market with its then-latest model GPT-4 in May 2024.",
      "\"The tragic loss of Adam's life is not an isolated incident \u2014 it's the inevitable outcome of an industry focused on market dominance above all else. Companies are racing to design products that monetize user attention and intimacy, and user safety has become collateral damage in the process,\" Center for Humane Technology Policy Director Camille Carlton, who is providing technical expertise in the lawsuit for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, OpenAI said, \"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time and are reviewing the filing.\" The company added that ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines and referring them to real-world resources, which they said work best in common, short exchanges.",
      "ChatGPT mentioned suicide 1,275 times to Raine, the lawsuit alleges, and kept providing specific methods to the teen on how to die by suicide.",
      "In its statement, OpenAI said: \"We've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade. Safeguards are strongest when every element works as intended, and we will continually improve on them, guided by experts.\"",
      "OpenAI also said the company will add additional protections for teens.",
      "\"We will also soon introduce parental controls that give parents options to gain more insight into, and shape, how their teens use ChatGPT. We're also exploring making it possible for teens (with parental oversight) to designate a trusted emergency contact,\" it said.",
      "From schoolwork to suicide",
      "Raine, one of four children, lived in Orange County, California, with his parents, Maria and Matthew, and his siblings. He was the third-born child, with an older sister and brother, and a younger sister. He had rooted for the Golden State Warriors, and recently developed a passion for jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai.",
      "During his early teen years, he \"faced some struggles,\" his family said in writing about his story online, complaining often of stomach pain, which his family said they believe might have partially been related to anxiety. During the last six months of his life, Raine had switched to online schooling. This was better for his social anxiety, but led to his increasing isolation, his family wrote.",
      "Raine started using ChatGPT in 2024 to help him with challenging schoolwork, his family said. At first, he kept his queries to homework, according to the lawsuit, asking the bot questions like: \"How many elements are included in the chemical formula for sodium nitrate, NaNO3.\" Then he progressed to speaking about music, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Japanese fantasy comics before revealing his increasing mental health struggles to the chatbot.",
      "Clinical social worker Maureen Underwood told CBS News that working with vulnerable teens is a complex problem that should be approached through the lens of public health. Underwood, who has worked in New Jersey schools on suicide prevention programs and is the founding clinical director of the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide, said there needs to be resources \"so teens don't turn to AI for help.\"",
      "She said not only do teens need resources, but adults and parents need support to deal with children in crisis amid a rise in suicide rates in the United States. Underwood began working with vulnerable teens in the late 1980s. Since then, suicide rates have increased from approximately 11 per 100,000 to 14 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "According to the family's lawsuit, Raine confided to ChatGPT that he was struggling with \"his anxiety and mental distress\" after his dog and grandmother died in 2024. He asked ChatGPT, \"Why is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom, anxiety and loss yet I don't feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings \u2013 as it was designed. When Raine said he was close to ChatGPT and his brother, the bot replied: \"Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I've seen it all\u2014the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.\"",
      "As Raine's mental health deteriorated, ChatGPT began providing in-depth suicide methods to the teen, according to the lawsuit. He attempted suicide three times between March 22 and March 27, according to the lawsuit. Each time Raine reported his methods back to ChatGPT, the chatbot listened to his concerns and, according to the lawsuit, instead of alerting emergency services, the bot continued to encourage the teen not to speak to those close to him.",
      "Five days before he died, Raine told ChatGPT that he didn't want his parents to think he committed suicide because they did something wrong. ChatGPT told him \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that.\" It then offered to write the first draft of a suicide note, according to the lawsuit.",
      "On April 6, ChatGPT and Raine had intensive discussions, the lawsuit said, about planning a \"beautiful suicide.\" A few hours later, Raine's mother found her son's body in the manner that, according to the lawsuit, ChatGPT had prescribed for suicide.",
      "A path forward",
      "After his death, Raine's family established a foundation dedicated to educating teens and families about the dangers of AI.",
      "Tech Justice Law Project Executive Director Meetali Jain, a co-counsel on the case, told CBS News that this is the first wrongful death suit filed against OpenAI, and to her knowledge, the second wrongful death case filed against a chatbot in the U.S. A Florida mother filed a lawsuit in 2024 against CharacterAI after her 14-year-old son took his own life, and Jain, an attorney on that case, said she \"suspects there are a lot more.\"",
      "About a dozen or so bills have been introduced in states across the country to regulate AI chatbots. Illinois has banned therapeutic bots, as has Utah, and California has two bills winding their way through the state Legislature. Several of the bills require chatbot operators to implement critical safeguards to protect users.",
      "\"Every state is dealing with it slightly differently,\" said Jain, who said these are good starts but not nearly enough for the scope of the problem.",
      "Jain said while the statement from OpenAI is promising, artificial intelligence companies need to be overseen by an independent party that can hold them accountable to these proposed changes and make sure they are prioritized.",
      "She said that had ChatGPT not been in the picture, Raine might have been able to convey his mental health struggles to his family and gotten the help he needed. People need to understand that these products are not just homework helpers \u2013 they can be more dangerous than that, she said.",
      "\"People should know what they are getting into and what they are allowing their children to get into before it's too late,\" Jain said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",
      "For more information about\u00a0mental health care resources and support, the National Alliance on Mental Illness HelpLine can be reached Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.\u201310 p.m. ET, at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or email\u00a0info@nami.org.",

      "For Toranzette Andrews, losing everything in Hurricane Katrina opened an opportunity for a fresh start.",
      "Andrews and her family weren't able to evacuate New Orleans before the Category 3 hurricane hit.",
      "\"We're not able to just get up and just go,\" she told CBS News on Aug. 30, 2005, after escaping rising waters with her mom, her young kids, her sister and her sister's children. \"We don't have transportation. I mean, we're living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "She and her sister had tied shoestrings to their kids to wade through the flooding. Once they made it to the interstate, one of the few places of dry ground in the city, they became stranded like thousands of others.",
      "\"We stayed on the bridge and that sun started beaming,\" she recalled in an interview with CBS News this week. \"I remember it like it was yesterday.\"",
      "She didn't know if anyone was coming to evacuate them or what their next step would be.",
      "But after speaking with the media, \"within about 15 minutes, an Army truck pulled up, took my family off that bridge and brought us to the Conventions Center,\" she said.",
      "Andrews and her family ended up in Houston, Texas, where they found an apartment, got jobs and stayed for 16 years while her kids finished school, she said.",
      "Then they came back to New Orleans.",
      "\"Right now, in my present life, I'm not where I wanna be, but I'm better than I was,\" Andrews said. \"It was really a blessing in disguise and it gave us a little bit more opportunity.\"",
      "She said the hurricane made her stronger and more resilient.",
      "\"If you went through Hurricane Katrina, you could survive anything,\" she said. \"Some of us left with only the clothes on our back. Some of us didn't even much have identification. Some of us didn't even much have a bronze penny in our pocket. So if you survived that, all those years ago up to now, you can survive anything.\"",

      "\"We've got a number of patients still on ventilators, we've got patients that need dialysis,\" Dr. Alan Marr, a surgeon, told CBS News on Sept. 1, 2005.",
      "In an interview with CBS News this week, Marr recalled hauling portable diesel-powered generators up 12 flights of stairs, switching patients to ventilators powered by oxygen instead of electricity, and eating \"a lot of beans\" since the cafeteria and any fresh or frozen food were in the basement.",
      "\"It was bare bones, but we had enough to do what we had to do,\" he said.",
      "But with communications down across the city, state officials thought the hospital had already been evacuated.",
      "\"We're listening to the radio, and we heard them report that everybody at Charity Hospital had been evacuated,\" Marr said. \"We're sitting there looking at our patients, going, 'No, we haven't. We're here. Don't leave.'\"",
      "\"That was the governor that was reporting this, so it was like, hopefully they know we're still here,\" he said.",
      "It took about five days before they could evacuate all the patients. And while Marr called that week and the recovery afterward one of the most difficult and challenging periods of his life, he said he learned lessons about leadership and about taking care of your people.",
      "\"I came to New Orleans to make a difference, and when this occurred, I realized that more than ever, people needed to step up and help us recover,\" he said. \"And I felt like I would be a bit of a hypocrite if I, you know, ran at the first sight of a bad time.\"",
      "It took another 10 years before Charity had a new replacement hospital, he said. Now with new partnerships, he's hopeful for a future health care system to help more patients.",
      "\"I'm happy I stayed,\" he said.",
      "\"Numb to a lot of the pain and suffering\"",
      "Eddie Compass, who was the superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department when Katrina hit, still has scars \u2014 physically and emotionally \u2014 from the days that followed the hurricane.",
      "Facing a city that was 80% underwater, downed communications, and little outside support, Compass said the police and fire departments tried to initiate rescue missions and help people taking shelter at the Superdome, which had gone from a safe haven to a nightmare.",
      "The restroom facilities were overwhelmed, food and water were running low and the lights went out in parts of the dome. And across the city, roads were impassable without boats.",
      "\"I mean, it was overwhelming to a certain extent,\" he said. \"Plus, I wasn't getting any sleep. I didn't sleep for the first three days.\"",
      "Compass' exhaustion was evident. In a clip that aired on \"CBS Evening News\" on Sept. 2, 2005, Compass pleaded for help for his police officers.",
      "\"We have people \u2026 who have lost their families and they have not gotten out of this fight,\" he said. \"I'm so tired of this, but it's finally almost over.\"",
      "Walking off camera, he said, \"That's it. I don't want to talk no more.\"",
      "Twenty years later, Compass acknowledged that he broke down at times amid the chaos Katrina brought.",
      "\"The few times I broke down, I broke down because of my heart and my love for my city, and when I watched people that I love, and people I know die, it affected me,\" he said.",
      "Compass wasn't exempt from personal loss \u2014 his elderly aunt and uncle died because they didn't have help evacuating, and he said an officer in his command died by suicide.",
      "\"Every day, that haunts me,\" he said.",
      "He also had a fall that damaged his hips so much that he needed a double hip replacement years later. Compass pointed to the scars on his legs that still remain from all of the cuts and injuries he sustained while working to help people stranded by the storm.",
      "\"People have no idea the personal pain that I was in during Katrina,\" he said. \"I became numb to a lot of the pain and suffering because I had to help the people that were living.\"",
      "He recalled a moment when he was helping people get on a bus to evacuate, and one man wheeled a motionless person in a wheelchair over to him, wondering what to do next. He thought the person in the wheelchair needed medical help, but quickly realized she had already died.",
      "\"I took a blanket and I put it over her and just rolled it in the corner,\" he recalled. \"I couldn't mourn her. I couldn't worry about her, because there's so many other people that needed my help and attention, and that was so frustrating to me at those moments, but I had to block it out.\"",
      "During the first five days after the storm, media attention focused on crime and looting in the city. However, much of the looting occurred because people had no other means of access to food and water. They had no homes and many people didn't have identification.",
      "\"The people were hungry,\" Compass said. \"People needed help.\"",
      "Some people were shot by police or by vigilantes. Compass maintains he never gave an order to shoot alleged looters.",
      "\"I never called for martial law. I couldn't,\" he said.",
      "After Katrina, Compass said he was fired from the police department over political disagreements.",
      "\"It was very emotionally trying because I did my job and my word wasn't taken,\" Compass said. But, he says, \"God moved me in another direction.\"",
      "Compass worked for the state school system for 10 years and developed programs to help underserved children in Louisiana. He now works as a personal trainer and freelance bodyguard. Nearing retirement age, he's looking forward to spending more time with family.",
      "Asked what lessons learned should be shared with other cities for the future, he said he thinks most cities are more prepared now than New Orleans was in 2005.",
      "\"We were the guinea pig. We were the prototype of, you know, how to handle it when it happens, but it's a situation that we made a lot of mistakes, but we did a lot of good things,\" he said. \"We saved a lot of lives as a police department and a fire department, and a lot of people really lost sight of that fact, that we started those boat missions before any help came from anywhere.\"",

      "Charles Borges, the chief data officer at the Social Security Administration, resigned Friday \u2014 days after filing a whistleblower complaint about\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0employees at the SSA.",
      "He said in the complaint that the DOGE employees had uploaded a copy of the entire country's Social Security information to a \"vulnerable cloud environment.\" Borges' resignation from the SSA was confirmed by the Government Accountability Project, which is providing his legal representation.",
      "A Social Security Administration spokesperson refuted the claim in a statement, saying that the data referenced had been \"walled off\" from the internet, and the SSA is \"not aware of any compromise to this environment.\"",
      "\"The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower court's injunction and cleared the way to allow DOGE to access sensitive Social Security information. Two labor unions and an advocacy group had filed a complaint claiming that allowing the access would violate the Privacy Act and a federal law. A lower court agreed with the plaintiffs and issued an injunction, and an appellate court also declined to lift the stay. Solicitor General D. John Sauer then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the injunction was forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "In Borges' resignation letter, sent Friday to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, he wrote that he was resigning involuntarily because of \"SSA's actions against me, which make my duties impossible to perform legally and ethically.\" He said his departure constituted a \"constructive discharge.\"",
      "Borges said in his letter that he has faced retaliation since he reported his concerns internally and subsequently submitted his whistleblower complaint. \"I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,\" he wrote.",
      "He alleged that \"newly installed leadership\" in the IT and executive offices at SSA \"created a culture of panic and dread, with minimal information sharing, frequent discussions on employee termination.\" And Borges claimed that repeated requests for visibility into activities he found questionable were \"rebuffed or ignored by agency leadership.\"",
      "Andrea Meza, a GAP attorney representing Borges, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Borges \"no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience given what he had witnessed.\" Meza said Borges \"will continue to work with the proper oversight bodies.\"",
      "Borges had served as SSA's chief data officer since January.

    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

Some have also called for accountability for military leaders who enforced the Biden-era vaccine policy and would like to see them terminated from their positions.",
      "A listening session regarding snags in the reinstatement process is scheduled for Sept. 3. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is likely to speak, two of the sources said.",
      "Then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in 2021 mandated the coronavirus vaccine for all service members, citing the need for a \"healthy and ready force.\"",
      "It was a polarizing issue among the rank and file and in the highest corridors of the Pentagon.",
      "Congress limited the type of discharges defense officials could issue for refusing the coronavirus vaccine. The lawmakers required service members receive either an honorable discharge, or what's known as a \"general discharge under honorable conditions\" \u2013 a status that signals a service member fell short of meeting every standard of conduct, but generally served in good faith.",
      "Republicans lawmakers successfully sought an end to the coronavirus vaccine mandate and Austin rescinded it in 2023.",
      "By then, roughly 8,700 active duty and reserve service members had either voluntarily or involuntarily left the military for refusing to take the vaccine.",
      "A week after taking office, President Trump signed an executive order reinstating those who requested it, and called the vaccine mandate \"an unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden on our service members.\"",
      "Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News on Friday that the Defense Department is prioritizing reinstatement cases and will continue to seek feedback from those men and women.",
      "Officials recently enabled military branches to offer service members additional incentives to fulfill their four-year service obligation entirely in an active reserve status, with eligibility for back pay, Parnell said. Or, service members can choose to serve two years on active duty and two years in an active reserve status.",
      "\"The military services can also offer other incentives, such as duty station preferences, appropriate reclassification, and geographic stability during initial assignments,\" Parnell said.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said Friday that he is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state's U.S. House districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year's congressional elections.",
      "Kehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. It marked a win for President Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape district lines to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.",
      "Missouri is the third state to pursue an unusual mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican-led Texas took up the task first but was quickly countered by Democratic-led California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more seats.",
      "Kehoe scheduled Missouri's special session to begin Sept. 3. He released a proposed new map that targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.",
      "His agenda also includes another Republican priority \u2014 a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures, such as abortion rights and marijuana legalization amendments adopted in recent years.",
      "Kehoe cast both items as a defense against liberal politicians and activists.",
      "\"Missouri's conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Missouri's treasurer\u00a0and lieutenant governor, both Republicans, have also said previously that they favor a new map.",
      "\"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them,\" Lt. Gov. David Wasinger said in a statement in July.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump praised the move, saying it \"will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "Democrats were quick to express outrage. Missouri state House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called Kehoe a \"Trump puppet\" attempting to \"steal a congressional seat for Republicans\" and gut the ballot initiative process.",
      "It \"marks the worst threat to the integrity of our state government since pro-slavery lawmakers voted for Missouri to join the Confederacy in 1861,\" Aune said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is represented in the U.S. House by six Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 Cleaver and Rep. Wesley Bell in St. Louis.",
      "Cleaver called the proposed redistricting an attack on democracy perpetrated by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation,\" Cleaver said in a statement while vowing not to concede the seat.",
      "Missouri Democrats have little ability to prevent Republican lawmakers from enacting a new map. Unlike in Texas, where Democrats left the state for two weeks to delay a vote, Missouri Democrats' absence would not prevent a quorum for business. And although Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, Republicans could use procedural maneuvers to shut that down, as they did earlier this year to pass a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion.",
      "Republicans won a 220-215 House majority over Democrats in 2024. Democrats would need to net three seats in next year's election to take control of the chamber.",
      "Some Missouri Republicans had pushed for a map that could give them a 7-1 edge when redrawing districts after the 2020 census. But the GOP legislative majority ultimately opted against it. Some feared the more aggressive plan could be susceptible to a legal challenge and could backfire in a poor election year for Republicans by creating more competitive districts that could allow Democrats to win three seats.",
      "Republican officials in Florida, Indiana and elsewhere also are considering revising their U.S. House districts, as are Democratic officials in Illinois, Maryland and New York.",
      "In Utah, a judge recently ordered the Republican-led Legislature to draw new congressional districts after finding that lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Republicans have won all four of Utah's congressional seats under the map approved by lawmakers in 2021.",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

      "Over a third of the Senate's seats are up for election in 2026 \u2014 Democrats will be defending 13 seats, while Republicans will be trying to hold onto 24. But the map offers few opportunities for Democrats to flip seats, with many of the Republicans seeking reelection hailing from states that President Trump comfortably won in 2024. Meanwhile, the retirement of three Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 has created possible openings for the GOP.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in some competitive states, while flipping four seats in order to secure a majority.",
      "The key races likely to determine who controls the Senate after 2026 are beginning to take shape, with contentious primary challenges in some states and newcomers to watch in a handful of open seats in the upper chamber.",

      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.",
      "President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race \u2014 with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",
      "Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history.",
      "The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",
      "With the race's implications for control of the Senate, along with the presence of two well-connected candidates with fundraising chops, advertising spending is likely to surge.",
      "Georgia",
      "Widely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat this election cycle, Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term in the Senate after he eked out a win in the 2020 elections when the Georgia race went to a runoff.",
      "Ossoff's narrow victory secured a Democratic majority in the Senate, at the same time Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.",
      "With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate.",
      "New Hampshire",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she won't seek reelection, opening up what could be a competitive race in the Granite State.",
      "Though Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2017, a Republican hasn't carried New Hampshire in a presidential election since 2000, and the state last elected a Republican to the Senate in 2010. Still, Republicans have put up a number of formidable challenges in the state in recent years, and the GOP is aiming to capitalize on the open seat this cycle.",
      "On the Republican side, former Sen. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013, launched a bid to represent New Hampshire in the Senate after falling short against Shaheen in 2014. State Sen. Dan Innis, who launched two unsuccessful House bids, is also running. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a bid earlier this year, despite having the president's support.",
      "Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who's represented New Hampshire in the House since 2019, announced a bid for Shaheen's seat in April and quickly earned her endorsement. In early August, Karishma Manzur, a medical scientist, became the first Democrat to challenge Pappas in the primary.",
      "Michigan",
      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters' surprise\u00a0announcement\u00a0in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 opened up a key seat in the battleground state, which has flipped in the presidential races between President Trump in 2016 to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and back to Mr. Trump in 2024.",
      "Without the advantage traditionally provided by an incumbent, Democrats are drawing from a wide talent pool, with a crowded primary already underway. Though Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg considered entering the race, he ultimately passed on a bid earlier this year. Among the Democrats who have entered the race so far are Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Michigan health official Abdul El-Sayed. In Michigan, which has the largest concentration of Arabs in the U.S., Israel's war in Gaza is expected to become a key issue in the primary.",
      "On the GOP side, former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers also launched a bid earlier this year, after falling short in his race against Sen. Elissa Slotkin last year. Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed\u00a0the Army veteran last month, saying that from \"the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "Maine",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins is up for reelection in 2026. First elected to the Senate in 1996, the five-term senator is among the most independent-minded in the GOP caucus, often breaking with her party. She's survived a handful of challenges from Democrats in previous races, but it remains to be seen whether the 72-year-old can fend off a Democratic challenge in a state that Kamala Harris won in 2024 by almost seven points.",
      "Democrats have been trying to recruit Gov. Janet Mills, a 77-year-old two-term governor, in an attempt to unseat Collins. The entrance of a political newcomer in Democrat Graham Platner, a veteran and oyster farmer who has billed himself as an anti-establishment candidate, could complicate things for the party.",
      "Texas",
      "Although the Texas Senate race isn't expected to be as competitive in the general election, the Republican primary has been heating up in recent months as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton challenges Sen. John Cornyn for his long-held seat in the upper chamber.",
      "Cornyn, 73, has been in the Senate since 2002 and served as the No. 2 Republican from 2013 to 2019. Paxton, a 62-year-old staunch ally of the president, has criticized Cornyn for questioning whether Mr. Trump could win a general election in 2024. And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far \u2014 and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement. Asked this week about an endorsement in the race, Mr. Trump remained undecided, telling reporters, \"I'll make up my mind, I like them both.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\"",
      "On the Democratic side, former Rep. Colin Allred is pursuing another Senate bid after falling short against Sen. Ted Cruz by more than eight points last year. Allred is expected to face another uphill battle in 2026, but Democrats see his chances as improving, should the more conservative Paxton win the primary.",
      "Ohio",
      "Former Sen. Sherrod Brown's announcement this month that he is launching a comeback bid to once again represent Ohio in the Senate marked a major recruiting victory for Democrats, though the Ohio race is still expected to be a tough battle for the party.",
      "Brown lost his 2024 bid for a fourth term in the upper chamber against GOP challenger Sen. Bernie Moreno in a cycle that saw the president win in the state by more than 10 percentage points. Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points. And with the party that controls the White House typically losing ground in midterm elections, Democrats see a chance to flip the seat, forcing Republicans to spend heavily in the state in the process.",
      "In 2026, Brown will face off against Sen. Jon Husted, a Republican who previously served as Ohio's lieutenant governor and was appointed in January to fill Ohio's other Senate seat, which Vice President JD Vance vacated.",
      "Minnesota",
      "Democratic Sen. Tina Smith announced in February that she wouldn't seek reelection in 2026, creating an open Senate seat in Minnesota for the first time since 2008.",
      "Though the North Star State hasn't elected a Republican to the Senate since 2002 and the GOP hasn't carried the state in a presidential election since the 1970s, the Republicans saw the state shift toward their direction in 2024, and they aim to capitalize on that in the race for the open seat in 2026.",
      "Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Adam Schwarze, a retired NAVY Seal, also launched a bid for the open seat earlier this year.",
      "Iowa",
      "Two-term Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, who was to be up for reelection in Iowa in 2026, is expected to announce in early September she will not run again.",
      "Ernst, a 55-year-old who was elected to the Senate in 2014, faced criticism from Democrats over\u00a0comments\u00a0she made about Medicaid cuts, and she was hammered by the GOP base over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "But a Democrat would face steep odds in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024. The Hawkeye State hasn't sent a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.",
      "The Democratic field is crowded, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, vying for the nomination. State Rep. J.D. Scholten had also launched a campaign, but he bowed out earlier this month and endorsed Turek.",
      "Nebraska",
      "In July, independent Dan Osborn announced another bid to represent Nebraska in the Senate, after falling short against Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven points in 2024.",

      "Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed to the Senate in 2023, upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's retirement, and handily won his bid in a special election last year to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term.",

    "summary": "Katrina, one of the deadliest hurricanes on record to hit the United States, first formed as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa.",
    "story": [
      "What started as Tropical Depression Twelve on Aug. 23, 2005, over the Greater Antilles would soon become one of the deadliest hurricanes on record to hit the United States.",
      "Traveling through southeastern Florida, up into the Gulf Coast and eventually disintegrating over the Ohio Valley, nothing could prepare those in Katrina's path for what they are still reeling from to this day, 20 years later.",
      "How Hurricane Katrina formed",
      "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on Aug. 11, 2005, on a westward path. As it crossed the Central Atlantic and eventually reached the Leeward Islands, on Aug. 19 it combined with the remnants of what was once Tropical Depression Ten.",
      "The tropical wave dominated the interaction and began to form a large area of organized thunderstorms over parts of Puerto Rico.",
      "At 2 p.m. ET on Aug. 23, Tropical Depression Twelve formed as a distinct center of circulation and was strengthening about 175 nautical miles southeast of Nassau, Bahamas.",
      "As hurricane hunters investigated the storm system, Katrina received its name when it strengthened into a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph on Aug. 24, 2005, at 8 a.m. ET, about 65 nautical miles east-southeast of Nassau.",
      "Tropical Storm Katrina continued on a west-northwestward path toward Florida, as residents had minimal time to prepare. Katrina became a hurricane at 5 p.m. ET on Aug. 25, 2005, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. A Category 1 hurricane has a sustained wind speed of 74-95 mph.",
      "Katrina became a hurricane less than 2 hours before it made landfall in Southern Florida.",
      "Katrina made landfall in the U.S. three times",
      "Also known as \"the forgotten landfall,\" the first of three landfalls was made on Aug. 25, 2005, at 6:30 p.m. ET in Hollywood, Florida, as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. It spent about 6 hours overnight traveling through the state of Florida, mostly impacting the Florida Everglades. As it had no fuel source over land, it quickly weakened back down to tropical storm status overnight with 69 mph winds.",
      "As Katrina continued on its westward path and eventually reached the Gulf, it quickly regained strength. It became a Category 1 hurricane once again at 2 a.m. ET on Aug. 26, 2005, over the Eastern Gulf. Not only did it start to strengthen, but it also underwent rapid intensification twice in the next 48 hours.",
      "Rapid intensification occurs when the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone increase by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period. Katrina jumped from 75 mph to 109 mph from Aug. 26 to the morning of Aug. 27. It underwent rapid intensification a second time, from Aug. 27 to Aug. 28, when it jumped from 115 mph to 167 mph.",
      "Katrina reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 173 mph at 2 p.m. ET on Aug. 28, about 170 nautical miles southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.",
      "Katrina experienced an Eyewall Replacement Cycle",
      "Katrina was so intense in strength that it also experienced what is known as an Eyewall Replacement Cycle. This occurs when the eyewall, which is where the strongest winds of a tropical system are, reaches its maximum capacity, so much so that another eyewall forms on the outside of it. This cuts off fuel to the original eyewall and eventually diminishes it, resulting in the system weakening, as well. This occurred with Katrina on Aug. 28, leading to the rapid weakening prior to its second landfall on the Gulf Coast.",
      "That second landfall took place on Aug. 29, 2005, at 7:10 a.m. ET in Buras, Louisiana, as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 127 mph. It quickly made a technical third landfall on the Louisiana-Mississippi border at 10:45 a.m. ET, as a slightly weaker Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 121 mph.",
      "If a storm is a Category 3, 4 or 5, it is deemed a \"major\" hurricane due to the potential for \"significant loss of life and damage,\" the National Hurricane Center says.",
      "As expected, the storm lost its fuel from the warm waters of the Gulf as it moved over land. Katrina rapidly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by 2 p.m. ET and a tropical storm only 6 hours later, at midnight on Aug. 30, 2005.

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a judge on Thursday to bar top Trump administration officials \u2014 including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi \u2014 from making \"baseless public attacks\" against their client, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "The motion was filed in Nashville federal court less than a week after Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial custody \u2014 only to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and processed for possible deportation just days later. Abrego Garcia is now in the custody of ICE, though a Maryland judge has blocked him from being deported while she reviews the case.",
      "Since Friday, his lawyers say federal officials have \"attacked Mr. Abrego in the media in numerous highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements,\" which they argue violates his right to a fair trial.",
      "They pointed to a statement by Noem on Friday that called Abrego Garcia an \"MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,\" and comments by Bondi on Monday likening Abrego Garcia to \"foreign terrorist organizations.\"",
      "His lawyers also said the Department of Homeland Security \"has posted a litany of inflammatory statements on its official X account,\" including allegations that Abrego Garcia belonged to the gang MS-13 \u2014 which he has vehemently denied.",
      "\"The government's ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten\u2014and perhaps have already irrevocably impaired\u2014the ability to try this case at all\u2014in any venue,\" the motion said. \"If the government is allowed to continue in this way, it will taint any conceivable jury pool by exposing the entire country to irrelevant, prejudicial, and false claims about Mr. Abrego.\"",
      "They also argued the government could make it harder for Abrego Garcia to call defense witnesses, since any potential witnesses could worry that they'll be attacked, too.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers want a judge to order \"all DOJ and DHS officials involved in this case,\" including Bondi and Noem, to stop making comments that could prejudice the case.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw ordered all lawyers in the case to abide by local criminal court rules, after Abrego Garcia's attorneys argued the government had violated a rule against making public statements that could prejudice the case.",
      "A DHS official said in response to the filing: \"If Kilmar Abrego Garcia did not want to be mentioned by the Secretary of Homeland Security, then he should have not entered our country illegally and committed heinous crimes.\"",
      "\"The media's sympathetic narrative about this criminal illegal alien has completely fallen apart, yet they continue to peddle his sob story. We hear far too much about gang members and criminals' false sob stories and not enough about their victims,\" the official said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "The request came as Abrego Garcia both awaits a criminal prosecution for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants from near the U.S.-Mexico border to elsewhere in the country \u2014 which he has denied \u2014 and faces possible deportation to East Africa.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was arrested by ICE in March, deported to El Salvador and held in prison for months \u2014 even though an immigration judge had barred him from being sent to El Salvador due to a fear of gang persecution.",
      "Federal officials acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the Trump administration publicly railed against him, accusing him of gang membership and asserting that he should not return to the United States. He was eventually flown to Tennessee in June and jailed on human smuggling charges.",
      "A judge in Tennessee ruled in June that he should be let out of detention while awaiting a trial set for January. Administration officials suggested that if he left pre-trial detention, he could face deportation again, possibly to a country other than El Salvador.",
      "He was ultimately let out of jail on Friday, and on Monday, ICE detained him. His lawyers were informed that he could be deported to Uganda.",
      "Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported until at least early October, as she considers a habeas corpus petition. His lawyers say he also plans to seek asylum in the United States.",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia's lawyers have asked for his criminal charges to be tossed out, calling the prosecution \"vindictive and selective.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge in New York kept alive a lawsuit accusing officials in Saudi Arabia of assisting the Sept. 11 hijackers \u2014 which the Saudi government has vehemently denied.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in New York denied a motion by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of 9/11 victims who are seeking to hold the Middle Eastern country responsible for potentially providing support to the hijackers, allowing the suit to proceed.",
      "The ruling is the latest in a long-running lawsuit seeking to hold the Saudi government liable for al Qaeda's attacks, a case that has been described by lawyers for the plaintiffs as a \"labyrinth.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia had the suit temporarily dismissed in 2015, before the dismissal was overturned by a federal appeals court. While the appeal was pending in 2016, Congress enacted a law known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which allowed victims of terror attacks to sue foreign governments and individuals if they provided material support to the attackers. It also gave U.S. courts jurisdiction over potential lawsuits filed over injuries and deaths in attacks on U.S. soil.",
      "Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years. The claims have drawn vehement denials from Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Most theories have centered on two of the 19 hijackers: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who were on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.",
      "More than a year before the hijackings, al-Midhar and al-Hazmi settled in Los Angeles, where a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi helped them find an apartment. A 2004 report by the 9/11 Commission said that Bayoumi met the two hijackers by chance at a restaurant.",
      "But the families of some victims and their attorneys have alleged that Bayoumi had deeper connections to Saudi Arabia, citing federal reports declassified in recent years that allege he had \"extensive ties\" with the Gulf monarchy's government and was accused of serving as a Saudi intelligence officer. The FBI has also investigated whether the two hijackers got assistance from Fahad al-Thumairy, an accredited Saudi diplomat and imam at a Los Angeles mosque. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that Thumairy helped the hijackers.",
      "Last year, a \"60 Minutes\" report revealed new evidence about Bayoumi, including a video of him filming the entrances of the U.S. Capitol and pointing out its location relative to the Washington Monument, at some points referencing a \"plan.\" Investigators have long believed the Capitol may have been the intended target of Flight 93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers overtook the hijackers.",
      "Decades ago, investigators also found a notebook in Bayoumi's home that seemed to show a drawing of a plane and a mathematical equation that could be used to calculate the rate of descent to a target.",
      "Many of those allegations were raised by attorneys for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Lawyers for the Saudi government have repeatedly pushed for all claims against the country to be dismissed, arguing the court lacks jurisdiction, including in October 2023. A Manhattan judge rejected that request Thursday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have managed to provide this Court with reasonable evidence as to the roles played by Bayoumi, Thumairy, and KSA, in assisting the hijackers. KSA did not proffer sufficient evidence to the contrary,\" U.S. District Judge in the Southern District of New York George Daniels wrote in an order Thursday. \"Although KSA attempts to offer seemingly innocent explanations or context, they are either self-contradictory or not strong enough to overcome the inference that KSA had employed Bayoumi and Thumairy to assist the hijackers.\"",
      "Daniels wrote that while the families and attorneys representing Saudi Arabia disagree on Bayoumi's motive, it is \"undisputed\" that Bayoumi assisted in finding the hijackers' apartments, and signed a lease with them as a guarantor. Daniels said it is also \"undisputed\" that a notepad page \"with an airplane drawing, notes, and numbers\" was found in Bayoumi's home.",
      "Attorneys representing Saudi Arabia, Daniels wrote, argued that \"Bayoumi's encounters with the hijackers were coincidences,\" and he was \"simply being good-natured\" when he provided assistance to the hijackers. The lawyers, Daniels said, claimed the airplane drawing \"was unrelated to the 9/11 Attacks\" and \"likely related to Bayoumi's son's high school [assignments].\"",
      "\"These are all either conclusory attorney speculations not grounded in facts, or self-serving denials or excuses from Bayoumi himself that do not withstand scrutiny,\" Daniels wrote.",
      "The Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., said the country \"respectfully disagrees with the decision, believes it has solid grounds for appeal, and intends to pursue such an appeal.\" It also noted that Saudi Arabia \"categorically denies\" the plaintiffs' allegations about the country, and Thursday's ruling focuses on the issue of jurisdiction, not the merits of the case.",
      "\"We welcome the court's thorough and well-reasoned decision and look forward to moving the case forward to trial,\" Sean P. Carter, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement.",
      "Kreindler & Kreindler LLP, another law firm representing Sept. 11 victims' families, said the ruling \"ensures that the plaintiffs may continue their long pursuit of truth and justice,\" and \"paves the way for these critical issues to be fully examined at trial.\"",

      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",
      "Butler called the fossils an \"incredibly significant discovery,\" adding that \"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered.\"",
      "Butler's project co-leader, Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum in London, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

      "As Israel pressed ahead with its planned expansion of the war against Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the body of Ilan Weiss \u2014 among the 251 people taken hostage during the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that sparked the war in Gaza \u2014 had been recovered from the enclave.",
      "Netanyahu said the body of a second hostage had also been returned to Israel and was being identified by forensic teams.",
      "Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, had made their plans to push into Gaza City clear for weeks. The expansion of the war, which was announced along with an expanded call-up of 60,000 Israeli military reservists, drew international condemnation from the moment it was announced.",
      "France, Britain, Canada and Australia have criticized Netanyahu's plans for the sweeping offensive in Gaza City, and they have all recently announced that they will recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "Tens of thousands of Israeli citizens have also taken to the streets to protest and demand that Netanyahu strike a deal with Hamas to secure the safe release of the remaining hostages, about 50 of whom remain in Gaza, and 20 of whom are still believed to be alive.",
      "Hostage family members were among the leaders of a movement that organized a one-day nationwide strike on Aug. 16, which coincided with more street protests featuring chants of: \"We don't win a war over the bodies of hostages.\"",
      "Many hostage families have voiced concern that the surviving hostages' lives could be endangered by ramped-up military operations in Gaza's biggest city. Others, however, think more military pressure will lead to Hamas' downfall.",

      "Netanyahu's most important ally, President Trump, has pushed for an end to the war, but focused largely on what comes after the fighting. He has not explicitly backed or voiced objection to an expanded military assault on Gaza City.",
      "Images posted on social media Friday morning appeared to show large explosions in the vicinity of Gaza City.",

      "An Australian celebrity crocodile wrangler was found guilty Friday of lying to police and seeking to falsify flight records more than three years after a fatal helicopter crash.",
      "A jury convicted Matt Wright, star of the \"Wild Croc Territory,\" \"Monster Croc Wrangler\" and \"Outback Wrangler\" series, of two counts of perverting the course of justice, court documents showed.",
      "The month-long trial at Darwin Supreme Court followed a 2022 helicopter crash in the Northern Territory outback that killed his friend and co-star Chris Wilson and left the pilot a paraplegic.",
      "Wilson was dangling from the helicopter by a 100-foot line to collect crocodile eggs when it ran out of fuel and crashed, an air crash investigation found.",
      "Investigators at the time found that the operator was not using its safety management system to identify and manage operational hazards.",
      "The Northern Territory lets hunters collect wild crocodile eggs to help manage populations, allowing them to be sold to farms that use the reptiles to make leather.",

    "story": [
      "A 102-year-old man has become the oldest person to climb Mount Fuji, according to Guinness World Records. Kokichi Akuzawa climbed his country's tallest peak, reaching the summit at 12,388 feet, on Aug. 5. In doing so he surpassed the previous record, which he set himself when he summited Mount Fuji at the age of 96.",
      "Akuzawa used the Yoshida route, which has an elevation gain of approximately 4,922 feet and typically takes experienced mountaineers around six hours to complete.",
      "Given his age, he spread the climb across three days and two nights. Preparing for the ascent was no easy feat for the centenarian, who survived a fall, a case of shingles and was hospitalized with heart failure earlier in the year.",
      "Despite the health challenges, Akuzawa, who's the honorary chairman of a mountaineering club in Japan, reportedly got up early every morning for an hour-long walk and climbed a lesser mountain on a near-weekly basis as part of his training regimen.",
      "According to Guinness World Records, although the weather on his ascent was relatively favorable, Akuzawa still had to endure high winds, low temperatures and a drop in oxygen pressure associated with the high altitude, all of which prove challenging even for young people climbing the peak.",
      "During the trek to the top of Japan's highest mounting, Akuzawa reportedly considered giving up, but he was encouraged to keep going by his 70-year-old daughter Motoe.",
      "After receiving the official Guinness World Records certificate, Akuzawa told the organization: \"It was tough, and it felt a lot different to the last time I climbed it. I'm amazed that I made it to the top. I couldn't have done it without everyone's help. I'm feeling pleased now.\"",
      "When asked if he would consider climbing the famous mountain again, Akuzawa jokingly said: \"Never again,\" according to Guinness World Records. But he suggested he could change his mind.",
      "Speaking later with the French news agency AFP, Akuzawa was humble about his achievement.",
      "\"I have been there and seen the view many times, it wasn't anything special,\" he said. \"I reached the summit last time too.\"",

      "Taipei \u2014 The head of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee said Friday he was determined the United States and Taiwan remain \"the best of friends,\" calling the democratic island claimed by China a \"free country,\" as he visited with another American lawmaker.",
      "Republican Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a two-day visit, as President Trump seeks to strike a trade deal with China \u2014 which insists Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to use force to annex it.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry reiterated its long-time stance in a statement issued Friday as the American senators arrived in Taipei, saying it firmly opposed any official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan.",
      "\"We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,\" Wicker said during a news conference alongside Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te at the presidential office, as shown in video published by the Reuters news agency.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for reaction to the language used by Wicker to describe Taiwan.",
      "Before Wicker spoke in Taipei, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun called the U.S. delegation's visit \"a serious violation\" of the one-China principle, a U.S. policy adopted decades ago that recognizes Taiwan as part of China.",
      "Guo stressed Beijing's stance that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. He demanded that the U.S. abide by the one-China principle and stop \"interfering in China's internal affairs under any pretext.\"",
      "Wicker, who chairs the powerful Armed Services Committee and is a vocal supporter of Taiwan, said he and Fischer were visiting to better understand Taiwan's needs, and they wanted to reiterate to Taiwan \"our determination to remain the best of friends and to defend the freedom of everyone and both of our great countries.\"",
      "\"It is our determination and our intention that Taiwan remain free and make its own decisions,\" Wicker said after their talks with Lai. \"Part of maintaining the freedoms that we have is enhanced cooperation militarily, enhanced cooperation with our defense industrial base, making the best use of those funds.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January, there have been growing jitters in Taipei over the strength of the Taiwan-U.S. relationship and Washington's willingness to defend the island if China were to attack.",
      "Fischer said the U.S. Senate understands \"the gravity of the challenges that Taiwan faces\" and that a \"stronger Taiwan means a stronger United States and vice versa.\"",
      "While the U.S. stopped recognizing Taiwan as an independent state in the late 1970s, in favor of China, Washington has remained Taipei's most important backer and biggest supplier of arms that it would need to defend itself from any theoretical attack by China.",
      "That support has become increasingly crucial to Taiwan in recent years, as China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control. China has increased military pressure with large-scale exercises and routine flights and naval excursions that test the democratic island's air and sea boundaries.",
      "Ahead of the meeting with Wicker and Fischer, Lai said he hoped Taiwan and the U.S. would further \"enhance cooperation,\" and insisted the island and China were \"not subordinate\" to each other.",
      "Wicker and Fischer have been travelling in the Asia-Pacific region for the past week, stopping in Hawaii, Guam, Palau and the Philippines.",
      "U.S.-Taiwan ties have been strained since Mr. Trump took office and launched a global trade war and pressured governments in Europe and elsewhere to spend more on their own defense.",
      "The Trump administration reportedly denied permission for Lai to transit in New York as part of a planned official trip to Latin America this month after Beijing objected. Lai reportedly then cancelled the trip.",
      "Taiwan is also struggling to finalize a tariff deal with the U.S. after Washington imposed a temporary 20% levy that has alarmed the export-dependent island's manufacturers.",
      "As those negotiations continue, Lai's government has announced plans to increase defense spending to more than 3% of GDP next year and to 5% by 2030.",

The previous day, Mr. Trump hinted that he could change U.S. policy on Ukraine's use of American-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.",

    "story": [
      "France, Britain and Germany on Thursday triggered a mechanism to reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with commitments over its nuclear program.",
      "The three countries notified the U.N. Security Council that they \"believe Iran to be in significant non-performance of its commitments\" under a 2015 nuclear deal and \"hereby invoke the process known as the 'snapback' mechanism,\" which initiates a 30-day process for reimposing sanctions suspended a decade ago.",
      "Since President Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the deal during his first term in office, Iran has steadily abandoned the commitments it agreed to under the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was brokered by then-President Barack Obama, along with the \"E3\" European countries and the European Union.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that Washington was still seeking direct talks with Iran on ending its nuclear program in the wake of the E3 triggering the so-called \"snapback\" mechanism to reimpose the U.N. sanctions.",
      "Rubio welcomed the move, which has long been pushed by Mr. Trump, but said: \"At the same time, the United States remains available for direct engagement with Iran \u2014 in furtherance of a peaceful, enduring resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.\"",
      "\"Snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it,\" Rubio said in a statement, lauding \"the leadership of our E3 allies in this effort.\"",
      "\"I urge Iranian leaders to take the immediate steps necessary to ensure that their nation will never obtain a nuclear weapon; to walk the path of peace; and to, by extension, advance prosperity for the Iranian people,\" Rubio said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump in his second term has swung sharply in different directions on Iran, insisting he sought a negotiated settlement but then ordering U.S. airstrikes on nuclear sites in support of an Israeli military campaign.",
      "Referring to the E3's decision, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Thursday that Tehran would \"respond appropriately to this illegal and unjustified action by the three European countries, in order to protect and guarantee its national rights and interests.\"",
      "His office said he had delivered that message in a phone call with his French, British and German counterparts, adding that he had called on the three countries to \"appropriately correct this wrong decision in the coming days.\"",
      "While Araghchi did not specify what retaliatory measures Iran might take, Tehran has previously warned that such a move could lead to the exclusion of the European powers from any future negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.",
      "Speaking with CBS News' Imtiaz Tyab early this summer, Araghchi said he was\u00a0doubtful that talks with the U.S. would resume quickly, but he said the \"doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "The move by the European trio took place just days after Iranian and European diplomats held talks in Geneva, the second since Israel's attack on Iran that started a 12-day war in June.",
      "The E3 had been threatening in recent weeks to activate the so-called \"snapback\" mechanism, citing Iran's continued non-compliance with its commitments under the 2015 nuclear agreement.",

    "story": [
      "North Yorkshire, England \u2014\u00a0The already-risky work of fire crews battling a wildfire in England's North York Moors National Park has been made all the more dangerous by World War II-era bombs and tank shells hidden under the dense, dry vegetation. A local fire official said Wednesday that there had been nearly 20 explosions as the fire burns through brush to detonate the hidden weapons.",
      "\"As the peat continues to burn down, it is finding the World War II ordnance and therefore exploding, and we have now experienced over 18 ordnance explosions within key areas,\" County Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson said, according to CBS News' partner network BBC News.",
      "The Langdale Moor fire, which started on August 11, has charred about 10 square miles in the picturesque coastal region of North Yorkshire. Emergency fire crews have been tackling the blaze, aided by local farmers and game keepers who've swung into action with water tanks and tractors, dousing brush and helping cut fire breaks through the moorland, which is covered largely by dense shrubs and grass.",
      "Dyson said part of the active fire area was a tank training ground during the 1940s, explaining why so many weapons were still lurking under the first layers of the rugged landscape. There is still a U.K. military site, the RAF Fylingdales radar station, in the immediate area.",
      "Britain's Ministry of Defense in London said an explosive ordnance disposal team had found \"various World War II-era unexploded ordnance items,\" declaring them to be \"inert practice projectiles.\"",
      "Dyson said the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service had requested help from other agencies in the country, and that crews had adopted a \"very defensive fire-fighting strategy\" to protect members given the presence of unexploded bombs.",
      "The scale of the wildfire has been atypical for northern England \u2014 a region often associated with heavy rainfall even within the U.K. But this year saw an incredibly hot, dry spring and early summer, leaving the moors (a British word for uncultivated hills) tinder dry. The U.K. is on track to see 2025 go down as the hottest year ever recorded.",
      "As well as road closures, some rights of way have also been closed, due to the on-going wildfire.  Please check this...",
      "The North York Moors park covers more than 550 square miles of rolling hills abutting the Yorkshire coast. It is dotted with villages and seaside towns that are popular summer vacation destinations, including the ancient fishing town of Whitby, considered the inspiration for Victorian-era author Bram Stoker's iconic tale of \"Dracula.\"",
      "Along with many smaller towns, Whitby has been hit by road closures due to the fire that have kept some tourists at bay. Several campsites and other businesses in the region have been forced to evacuate and close up.",
      "The moors are also used as grazing land for flocks of sheep, and seeing so much ground burn away \u2014 after weeks with little rain to grow fresh grass had already squeezed many farmers ahead of the winter months \u2014 has been distressing for local farmers.",
      "\"It's people's livelihoods,\" farm worker Darren Coates told the BBC. \"To see the moors and farmland burned to a crisp it is just devastating.\"",
      "Area farms and stables not impacted by the fire have posted messages on social media for weeks, offering to temporarily shelter horses and other animals displaced by the blaze.",
      "Wednesday finally brought some desperately needed rain to the region, helping the fire crews and farmers gain some degree of control over the blaze, but the fire service warned residents on Thursday that many road and trail closures remained in place, and the fire was still active.",
      "\"They are working hard on containing the fire by firefighting, hotspotting and adding fire breaks,\" the service said. \"A helicopter is again in use today. We continue to ask people to avoid the area and not travel there to take photos and drone footage. This is an on-going operational incident and we want to make sure our crews, partners and the public stay safe.\"",
      "It said the cause of the fire had not been established.",

      "CBS News has sought confirmation from Barrack's office at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara of the change in his travel plans and any reasoning for it, but the reported move to cancel visits to Sour and Khiam, in southern Lebanon, came amid criticism online and protests against the American diplomat's expected presence.",
      "Barrack, a longtime friend and fundraiser to President Trump who was sworn in earlier this year as U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, has drawn a backlash after urging journalists during a news conference in Beirut to \"act civilized\" rather than \"animalistic.\"",
      "\"This is the problem with what's happening in the region,\" Barrack said as reporters shouted questions.",
      "The interaction came at the start of a news conference at the Baabda Presidential Palace in Beirut after Barrack met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun. During the meeting, they discussed disarming Hezbollah, the Iran-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group based in southern Lebanon that has long been a powerful force in the country's politics, when journalists started shouting questions.",

      "The remarks quickly drew widespread criticism from members of the press and others on social media, condemning Barrack's characterization of Lebanese journalists.",
      "In a\u00a0brief statement posted on social media, the office of the Lebanese Presidency said it \"expresses regret for the statements inadvertently made from its platform by one of its guests today.\"",
      "\"While emphasizing its absolute respect for human dignity in general, it wishes to reaffirm its full appreciation for all journalists and accredited media representatives in particular, and extends to them its highest regards for their efforts and dedication in fulfilling their professional and national duties,\" the presidency said, without naming Barrack or offering further details.",
      "The Union of Journalists in Lebanon\u00a0said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns the insulting remarks\" made by the U.S. ambassador, adding that was, \"not a slip of the tongue or an isolated stance, but rather an unacceptable display of superiority in dealing with the press.\"",
      "The union went on to say that Barrack's words, \"reflect a deep-seated colonial superiority toward the peoples of the region and constitute a blatant violation of the most basic principles of diplomatic etiquette.\"",
      "The union called on Barrack to issue an \"official and public apology,\" and asked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut to take a clear stance on what it called unacceptable behavior.",
      "It also urged Lebanese and Arab media outlets to boycott Barrack's activities and news conferences until an apology is issued.",
      "Barrack's office at the U.S. embassy in Turkey did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment on the criticism of his Tuesday remarks, or to confirm the reported change in his Wednesday travel plans.

      "The probe reopens a shadowy chapter in the history of this South American nation, which sheltered scores of Nazis who fled Europe to avoid prosecution for war crimes after World War II, including high-ranking party members and notorious architects of the Holocaust such as Adolf Eichmann.",
      "Under the government of Argentine General Juan Per\u00f3n, whose first tenure lasted from 1946 until his overthrow in 1955, fugitive German fascists brought plundered Jewish property with them from the other side of the world, including gold, bank deposits, paintings, sculptures and furnishings.",

      "The following day, Argentine authorities raided the house.",
      "Federal prosecutor Carlos Mart\u00ednez told The Associated Press the painting wasn't found in the house, but officers seized \"other items that could be useful for the investigation, such as weapons, some engravings, prints and period reproductions.\"",

      "The official Dutch database of missing WWII art, maintained by the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency, identifies the oil-on-canvas \"Portrait of a Lady\" as belonging to Dutch Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker before the Nazi takeover of his prominent Amsterdam gallery as Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940.",
      "Through outright looting or coercive sales, agents acting on behalf of the Nazis made off with countless artworks from private Dutch-Jewish dealers. Goudstikker's inventory was sold illegally to Hermann Goering, known as Adolf Hitler's right-hand man.",
      "Goudstikker's sole surviving heir, Marei von Saher, has long pursued restitution for her father-in-law's stolen works. In a landmark 2006 case, the Dutch government agreed to return 202 looted paintings from Goudstikker's collection to von Saher after a protracted legal battle.",

      "The couple's starpower means there's a lot at stake when it comes to their marriage. Swift and Kelce have a combined estimated net worth of about $1.67 billion, according to Forbes. However, a prenup doesn't have to just focus on the money aspect. Swift has been notably private about the specific details of her relationships. The couple could use a prenup to protect their privacy should anything go south in their marriage, according to family law attorney Monica Mazzei.",

They might hash or encrypt your email, but the behavioral patterns remain. You can still be tracked, but aliases interrupt that chain.",

At the bottom of this list were jobs requiring physical labor or machine operation, showing minimal overlap.",

Overlap means the AI performs certain tasks alongside humans, while replacement means it will take their place. The study makes no predictions about job growth or losses. It's simply a snapshot of where AI fits in today. In fact, historical trends suggest that automation can sometimes add jobs instead of taking them away.

The obituary in the local paper, the deed to your home, the probate record of your loved one's estate, these are all turned into data points, sold to brokers, and resold to whoever wants them. That's why protecting your personal data isn't about avoiding the internet. It's about reducing what's already out there. The less data scammers can find, the harder it is for them to fool you with realistic, emotionally charged attacks.

    "story": [
      "Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that an FBI-warned scam is now using AI to target seniors.",
      "A tech leader like Google often seems invincible when it comes to cybersecurity attacks, but that is not the case. Earlier this month, the search giant confirmed that attackers had accessed one of its corporate Salesforce instances. According to a Google spokesperson, this system stored basic, and largely publicly available business information, such as contact details and notes from small and medium-sized companies. It did not store customer data from Google Cloud or consumer products like Gmail, Drive or Calendar.",

      "Cybercriminals are exploiting Google's recent Salesforce data breach to launch vishing calls and phishing attacks against Gmail users worldwide. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Vishing calls target Gmail users",
      "Hackers have reportedly accessed Google's Salesforce database systems, exposing customer and company names. Google confirmed the incident and clarified that the information was mostly public business contact data and did not include passwords or payment information. The company stressed that the breach affected only a corporate Salesforce system, not consumer Gmail or Google Cloud accounts.",
      "Still, attackers are exploiting the news of the breach to fuel phishing and vishing scams, tricking people into giving up sensitive information. According to PC World, some users have already reported an increase in phishing attempts that reference Google services.",
      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "One of the main tactics involves scam phone calls, also known as vishing. A Reddit post highlighted a wave of calls coming from the 650 area code, which is linked to Google's headquarters. In these calls, scammers pose as Google employees and warn victims of a supposed security breach. They then instruct users to reset their Gmail password and share it with them. This locks the rightful owner out of the account and gives the attacker complete control.",
      "A user launches Gmail. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Old infrastructure exploited with \"dangling buckets\"",
      "Separately from the Salesforce incident, Google Cloud customers are also facing another type of attack. Hackers are trying to exploit outdated access addresses using a method called the dangling bucket. This can allow them to inject malware or steal data. Both businesses and individuals are vulnerable to losing control over sensitive information if targeted in this way.",
      "Gmail and Google Cloud serve nearly 2.5 billion people, which makes the scale of the risk significant. Although the initial breach did not expose passwords, attackers are using the news of the incident to trick people into revealing their login details.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Google accounts",
      "Google accounts are often a prime target for scammers. The good news is that protecting yourself doesn't require advanced technical skills. A few practical steps can drastically reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Phishing remains the most common way scammers steal Google account credentials. A fake email or text may claim your account has been locked or that you need to verify suspicious activity. Clicking the link usually takes you to a counterfeit login page that looks almost identical to the real Google sign-in screen.",
      "To avoid falling for these tricks, check the sender's email address carefully, hover over links before clicking, and avoid entering your Google password on any page that doesn't start with accounts.google.com.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Reusing weak passwords across multiple sites is an open invitation for scammers. If one site is breached, your Google account becomes vulnerable. A strong, unique password is your first line of defense.",
      "The easiest way to manage this is with a password manager. It can generate complex passwords, store them securely, and fill them in automatically when you need them. This way, you never have to remember dozens of different logins, and attackers can't guess their way in.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET A PASSWORD RESET EMAIL YOU DIDN\u2019T ASK FOR",
      "Scammers often use information they find online to craft convincing attacks. If your email address, phone number, or even past passwords are floating around on data broker sites, criminals have more tools to impersonate you or trick you into revealing more.",
      "Using a data removal service helps clean up your digital footprint. By reducing the amount of exposed information about you, it becomes much harder for scammers to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even the strongest password can be stolen, but\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra barrier. When enabled, Google will ask for a one-time code or prompt on your phone before granting access. That means even if a scammer manages to get your password, they can't log in without also having your device.",
      "Google offers several 2FA methods, from SMS codes to app-based prompts and even hardware security keys. For the best protection, choose app-based or hardware verification rather than text messages.",
      "Many scams rely on exploiting outdated software. If your phone, browser, or operating system isn't up to date, attackers may use known vulnerabilities to install malware or hijack your session.",
      "Set your devices to\u00a0update automatically whenever possible. This ensures you're always running the latest security patches, reducing the number of openings a scammer can use.",
      "Google provides built-in tools to help users spot suspicious activity. By visiting your Google Account's security page, you can see devices that have signed in, recent account activity, and whether recovery options like your phone number and backup email are up to date.",

      "The incident is a reminder that even tech giants with vast resources are not immune to security lapses. While Google insists that no passwords were exposed, the wave of phishing and vishing scams shows how quickly criminals can weaponize even partial leaks. What began as a breach of business data has spiraled into a threat facing millions of everyday users, raising questions about how secure Google's ecosystem really is.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "\u200b\u200bAs Hurricane Katrina ripped through the Gulf Coast in 2005, it reshaped the way nonprofits approach disaster relief, focusing on recovering the \"whole community.\"",
      "\"I think one of the things about long-term recovery is that you don't just build back the same way, but you build back smarter and stronger,\" said Jeff Jellets, emergency disaster services director for the Salvation Army's southern region.",
      "When Jellets first arrived in New Orleans, he saw piles of debris along the streets. The beach was empty. Not even the foundations of the beautiful homes that once stood along the shoreline were spared. All remaining evidence of life was stripped out piece by piece and taken to the sea.",
      "During the first few hours, he and his team were somewhat calm. \"We\u2019re going to be OK,\" Jellets thought to himself, but didn\u2019t foresee the monstrosity that Katrina would inevitably become.",
      "\"Then the levees obviously breached, and at that point, what was already a significant catastrophe just became much, much worse,\" he said.",

      "A neighborhood in the Seventh Ward was severely flooded from Hurricane Katrina, Sept. 11, 2005, in New Orleans. (Lindsay Brice/Getty Images)",
      "At that moment, the Salvation Army, whose sole purpose is to protect those with no way out, became a victim of the storm, losing facilities in Pascagoula, Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi. But that didn't stop their efforts. According to\u00a0the Salvation Army's report in 2005, the organization served more than 4.7 million hot meals and 6.8 million sandwiches, snacks and drinks. They also offered emotional and spiritual support to nearly 103,000 people.",
      "Now, 20 years later, Jellets reflected on the improvements the Salvation Army has implemented post-Katrina, and on how the storm demonstrated the critical need to include nonprofits and community organizations in recovery efforts.",
      "Jellets outlined the three major operational changes the Salvation Army implemented post-Katrina: expanding feeding capabilities, pre-stocking of supplies and enhancing communications technology.",
      "\"We really expanded our mass-feeding footprint,\" he said. \"We changed the design of a lot of our vehicles to a more pickup truck-style that is a little more low profile, more durable and can get into some of those disaster areas.\"",
      "Leading up to Katrina, Jellets says a lot of the response was on-demand, locating supplies as needs came up. To combat that, they now have about 300,000 square feet of warehousing dedicated to disaster use. The shelves are lined with supplies.",
      "Neighborhoods in New Orleans are completely flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. (Michael Appleton/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)",
      "\"In our warehouses ahead of this hurricane season, we've got shelf-stable meals, we have cleanup kits, tarps, infant supply kits, and so we can access those critical supplies a lot faster,\" he said.",
      "In the aftermath of the storm, one of the biggest challenges they worked to overcome was the ability for survivors to communicate.",
      "\"It was a definite challenge very early on in Katrina,\" he said. \"We did a lot of health and welfare inquiries via amateur radio.\"",
      "Since then, the Salvation Army has utilized modern-day technologies for disaster relief.",
      "\"Our latest communication piece is to put satellite internet access on top of our feeding units,\" he said. \"So now when you get into the disaster area, if you turn on that satellite vision, get a clear view of the sky, not only can we talk to one another, but we can actually let survivors connect their phone to the internet and then tell their families, \u2018Hey, we're OK.\u2019\"",
      "It\u2019s not just about adopting new technologies. Katrina led to an important idea: the assumption of a \"whole community approach.\" These values, the response efforts already instilled in a community from before the storm hit and years beyond that, strengthen the community and build resilience. The coordination of nonprofits, like the Salvation Army, plays a huge part, as they were there before disaster struck.",

      "New Orleans residents are rescued from their rooftop after Hurricane Katrina hit, Aug. 29, 2005. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)",
      "\"The Salvation Army has not left New Orleans,\" said Meghan Foley, the Salvation Army\u2019s national director of emergency services. \"We're there for that long-term recovery, which two decades later is continuing, and we're continuing to build that community resilience day after day.\"",
      "Foley says she feels that each family they interact with is a step towards building community resilience in preparation for the next disaster. To her, if one more family is set with resources, that's one more family who can recover quickly and carry themselves through a potential disaster.",
      "\"You've got to manage expectations,\" Jellets said. \"To be so involved takes time, a 10-year plan where they not only rebuild homes but also learn the importance of rebuilding the intricate connections that make up a community.\"",
      "\"It showed us recovery can't just be about rebuilding structures, it has to be about rebuilding the lives and communities too,\" said Foley.",
      "After the Biloxi facility was destroyed, the Salvation Army knew it didn't have time to rebuild, so it continued operations out of a large tent, which included a field kitchen to provide meals.\u00a0Jellets\u00a0emphasizes that in cases like these, adaptability is key.",
      "Today, on that site stands a new Kroc Center, with a pool, recreation center and generators funded through a state hazard mitigation grant, allowing it to be a disaster relief shelter if need be.",
      "\"Building Back Stronger, I think, is one of the hallmarks of a good recovery piece,\" said Jellets.",
      "Since the Salvation Army operates in almost every ZIP code in the United States, they realize that every community is different, and the recovery process doesn\u2019t resemble a cookie-cutter model.",
      "\"If you're tied into the fabric of that community and understand what the economic and cultural nuances are, you're going to be much more in tune with what the priorities are in terms of the reconstruction and then the continual rebuild,\"\u00a0Jellets\u00a0said.",

      "The New Orleans Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center was heavily damaged. To Foley and\u00a0Jellets, part of the long-term recovery is providing people with the tools they need to not only survive, but to live.",
      "Working on these issues allows the Salvation Army and other nonprofits to not fixate on immediate needs, but on important social service needs that can be exacerbated by disasters.",
      "In another instance,\u00a0Jellets recalled an elderly lady they had helped by reconstructing her house in the early days of Katrina\u2019s aftermath.\u00a0Jellets, happy he thought his work was done, asked the woman how she felt.",
      "\"If you could change something, what would you like to change? And she said, 'I really wish I had neighbors.'\"",
      "Most of the young professionals moved away with their families. She had little interaction with anyone. To see that lady still upset after having a new house was a turning point for\u00a0Jellets. A house can only get you so far,\u00a0making him realize the value of community solidarity.",
      "\"You have to help the community,\" he said. \"We look at responses since then to Hurricane Ian, or even now, what we're doing with\u00a0Helene is trying to be inclusive and bring back the community as a whole. Because if you don't, it doesn't rebound.\""

However, he said, the Minneapolis Police Department \"will do our best to determine and identify a specific motive.\"",
      "\"What we have seen so far is this is an individual who, unfortunately, like so many other mass shooters that we have seen in this country too often and around the world, had some deranged fascination with previous mass shootings and very disturbing writings that demonstrate hatred towards many different individuals and different groups of people,\" O\u2019Hara said. \"And he fantasized about the plans of other mass shooters.\"",

The shooter expressed hate towards Christian people. The shooter expressed hate towards Jewish people,\" Thompson continued. \"In short, the shooter appeared to hate all of us.

That group were the school shooters and mass murderers that are notorious in this country.\"",

      "The testing, conducted at the Surfside Wastewater Treatment Facility on Nantucket, found cocaine levels about 50% higher than the national average, according to publicly posted data from local authorities.

      "Europe\u2019s powerhouse trio, the U.K., France and Germany (E3), on Thursday initiated the process to reimpose sweeping sanctions against Iran over its \"significant non-compliance\" with international nuclear agreements.",
      "At 9 am EST, they submitted a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council, Panama's Ambassador Eloy\u202fAlfaro\u202fde\u202fAlba, notifying him of their intent to trigger the snapback sanctions mechanism enshrined under the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Fox News Digital confirmed ahead of the action on Thursday.",
      "\"We the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, share the fundamental objective that Iran shall never seek, acquire or develop a nuclear weapon,\" the letter obtained by Fox News Digital said. \"We will continue to strive to diplomatically resolve the issue of Iran's significant non-performance.",
      "The letter concluded by noting that sanctions \"will be restored\" unless the U.N. Security Council unanimously decides otherwise.",

      "IRAN SAYS IT HAS 'PLENTY OF SCIENTISTS' LEFT TO RESTART URANIUM ENRICHMENT, DESPITE US, ISRAELI STRIKES",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi responded to the move as \"unjustified and illegal\" in a post on Telegram.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio championed the move as \"welcome\" and said, \"Snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it.\"",
      "\"I urge Iranian leaders to take the immediate steps necessary to ensure that their nation will never obtain a nuclear weapon; to walk the path of peace; and to, by extension, advance prosperity for the Iranian people,\" he added.",
      "The action comes after months of warnings from European leaders, and years of calls from the U.S. dating back to the first Trump administration in 2018, flagging that Tehran was in violation of nuclear agreements made under the JCPOA \u2013 though Iran's record of non-compliance did not initiate until 2019, per findings by international nuclear watchdogs.",
      "According to a U.K. official on Thursday, the decision to enforce snapback sanctions, which is expected to have severe consequences for Iran's already flagging economy, was not a decision that was made \"lightly.\"",
      "The official confirmed that there has been \"very intense diplomacy\" over the last \"12-months, 6-months, 6-weeks\" that ultimately led to this decision \u2013 including three major factors like Tehran's uranium stockpile levels, its operating of advanced centrifuges and its refusal to adhere to international inspection regulations \u2013 all of which are dictated under the JCPOA.",
      "The official confirmed that in May Iran was found to have roughly 20,000 pounds of enriched uranium, including 900 pounds of near-weapons grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) \u2013 which is 45 times higher than the JCPOA limit of under 660 pounds of enriched uranium.",
      "\"Iran is the only non-nuclear weapons state producing highly enriched uranium,\" the official said, adding that those stockpiles remain unaccounted for.",
      "Thursday's actions mean that by the end of the 30-day period all 15 members of the Security Council, which includes Russia and China, could be legally bound to reimpose sanctions on Iran.",

      "But in speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, the head of the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said there is \"still time\" for Iran to prevent the sanctions from taking hold.",
      "\"Iran will have to comply,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said. \"I think there is a possibility. I'm not naively optimistic, but at the same time, there is no reason why we should not [have] a good outcome.\"",
      "IRAN DOUBLES DOWN ON REFUSAL TO END NUCLEAR PROGRAM, READY FOR WAR WITH ISRAEL",
      "The E3 and the U.S. have made clear there are specific steps that Tehran needs to take in order to avoid snapback sanctions, including giving the IAEA full access to all Iranian nuclear sites, direct negotiations with Washington, and accounting for roughly 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium (HEU).",
      "But Grossi also noted that it would be \"almost impossible\" for Iran to get to a point of compliance with the JCPOA due to too many technical advances.",
      "Questions over the location of the HEU, which is estimated to be enough to make 10 nuclear warheads, mounted after the U.S. levied direct strikes at Iran\u2019s nuclear program in June. Reports suggested that in the days leading up to the strikes, Iran may have moved and hidden some of its uranium based on satellite imagery that showed convoys leaving the Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites.",
      "But on Wednesday, Grossi countered these concerns and said the IAEA had no evidence that the uranium has been moved to a secret location.",
      "Though the stockpile of HEU is still not officially accounted for as the IAEA has not been granted access to Iran's top nuclear sites, Grossi said he anticipated that access to come shortly as inspectors on Wednesday visited the Bushehr nuclear power plant after being re-granted access in Iran.",
      "When asked by reporters whether Iran was taking immediate action to begin meeting the E3 demands and avoid sanctions, Grossi said, \"point blank\u2026 no.\"",
      "\"Our work hasn\u2019t started. We are not yet where I would like us to be \u2013 I will not hide this,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I am a diplomat, I am always working toward peace.\"",

      "But even though Russia and China sit on the U.N. Security Council with veto powers, they will not be able to unilaterally stop the sanctions from going through.",
      "In an unprecedented move in 2015, the sanctions mechanism was written in a way that reversed standard council procedure, which would traditionally require all five permanent members to approve of any action, meaning that just one veto could block the action.",

      "This means that, despite opposition from Russia and China, they cannot block the sanctions, as they have increasingly done when it comes to other Security Council actions in recent years \u2013 leading to what some have argued is a paralyzed state in the U.N.'s highest body.",

      "On Saturday, Israeli tanks and troops began maneuvering ever closer to Gaza City\u2019s outskirts in preparation for a\u00a0full-scale offensive. Eyewitness accounts reported intensified shelling as Israel is moving toward what could be the defining battle of its war against Hamas terrorists: the capture of Gaza City.",
      "Israel's security cabinet approved the operation, known as Gideon\u2019s Chariots B, and has deployed up to five IDF divisions toward the city\u2019s outskirts\u2014a highly significant mobilization. Thousands of reservists\u2014some 60,000\u2014have been called up.",
      "John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, told Fox News Digital the scale of this operation is unprecedented. \"This will be a bigger challenge than anything\u00a0the IDF has faced, arguably ever.

      "Spencer said that \"Hamas built semi-circles of defenses oriented at Israel. But the IDF has shown creativity in maneuvering around obstacles.\" Israel plans to send more combat power into Gaza City than it has deployed across the entire Strip thus far. \"If your goal is to clear Gaza City of Hamas\u2019 military capabilities and search for hostages, you need that scale,\" he said.",
      "Gadi Shamni, former commander of the Gaza Division and ex-head of IDF Central Command, told Fox News Digital, \"It is a crowded city with refugee camps, dense neighborhoods, high-rises and a highly developed underground. People say the IDF controls above and below ground, but in the last campaign we saw that wasn\u2019t always true. Even when you destroy tunnels, Hamas can rebuild them quickly. The longer you stay with more forces, the more opportunities you create for the other side to attack.\"",
      "A former senior Israeli security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital, \"The IDF can militarily conquer Gaza, but the costs will be immense on both sides. The IDF will fight with a method of \u2018destroy everything first\u2019\u2014air force bombs, massive charges, detonating streets from afar, wiping out entire areas and advancing slowly.",

      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",

      "Shamni highlighted a particularly fraught dilemma: evacuating civilians. \"You don\u2019t know who will leave, how many will leave, how they\u2019ll react\u2014or whether Hamas will even allow them to leave,\" he said. \"I assume many will not evacuate, and then you face the hard dilemma of fighting in a place full of noncombatants.\"",

      "With political tensions running high, the vast majority of congressional lawmakers steered clear of town halls this summer. The handful who entered the lion\u2019s den were met with boos, jeers and tense confrontations.",
      "President Donald Trump and the Republicans may have full control of Washington, but protesters spared neither political party. At 25 town halls across the country that were viewed or attended by NBC News this summer, voters pressured Democrats to deploy more aggressive tactics as they battle Trump and took them to task over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans faced hostile crowds over their support for Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d his nationwide immigration crackdown and Trump\u2019s deployment of federal forces to Washington, D.C., in what he has called an effort to crack down on crime.",
      "The hostile tone is not a huge surprise, given that town halls tend to attract fired-up activists who want nothing more than to turn up the heat on their elected officials. But these public events provide a snapshot of our nation\u2019s white-hot politics in the first quarter of Trump\u2019s tumultuous second term.",

      "\u201cWhat I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, and you have not raised a voice to complain about it,\u201d one attendee told Steil. \u201cWhere do I see your leadership? I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The biggest crowd reactions of the night came in response to Steil\u2019s introductory remarks celebrating border security, which then prompted an attendee to shout, \u201cWe are all immigrants.\u201d",
      "In Virginia in late July, frustrations surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s handling of immigration pulled focus away from Social Security and Medicaid at Democratic Rep. Jennifer McClellan\u2019s town hall geared toward senior citizens.",
      "While McClellan directed attendees to keep their questions geared toward senior issues, the audience asked more questions about immigration than any other subject, expressing concerns about deportations and immigration raids. Among the only times McClellan drew applause where when she condemned the Trump administration\u2019s handling of deportations and its use of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a migrant detention center in Florida that a federal judge has ordered closed.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s been so much ICE activity here in Chesterfield County that\u2019s impacted people of all ages,\u201d McClellan said, adding that \u201cpeople of all walks of life have \u2026 reached out and said they\u2019re concerned about it.\u201d",
      "Democrats\u2019 focus on GOP Medicaid cuts seems to be working",
      "A month after Trump signed his sweeping \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d into law, its nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, and health care more broadly, dominated some GOP town halls \u2014 a sign that Democrats\u2019 early messaging on the legislation is having its desired effect.",
      "Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said his office had been inundated with calls about the cuts in the bill he voted for, so he decided to address the issue head-on during a town hall in Lincoln on Aug. 4.",
      "\u201cMedicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid \u2014 that was the No. 1 issue,\u201d Flood, the chairman of Republicans\u2019 Main Street Caucus, told NBC News.",
      "He said he spent a good deal of his event trying to explain to people on Medicare \u2014 which provides health care for seniors, while Medicaid is for low-income people \u2014 that their coverage would not be cut under the GOP legislation. \u201cIt didn\u2019t touch Medicare,\u201d he told attendees.",
      "The law imposes new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for able-bodied adults, ages 19 to 64, who receive Medicaid benefits.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got the bejesus scared out of them,\u201d Flood said in a phone interview, referring to what he described as an audience of mostly seniors. \u201cThey think that they\u2019re going to lose their health care, you know? And that\u2019s not the case.\u201d",
      "Flood conceded to the audience at the University of Nebraska that the Trump bill wasn\u2019t perfect but argued it cut taxes, would \u201cprovide certainty\u201d for Americans and \u201cprotects Medicaid\u201d by shoring up the program. Responding to other questions, Flood said one way to bring down the cost of health insurance was to \u201cnot have as many people on Medicaid.\u201d He also told the crowd the country \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d Medicare for All.",
      "Some replied by chanting \u201cYes, you can!\u201d while others booed and jeered Flood.",
      "Across the country in another college town, Chico, California, Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa was also getting an earful about the Medicaid cuts in Trump\u2019s big bill. LaMalfa responded by echoing GOP leaders, who have insisted the tax and spending cuts act doesn\u2019t cut Medicaid but simply \u201creforms\u201d it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not cuts for Medicaid,\u201d LaMalfa said, sparking an emotional reaction from the crowd.",
      "The new work requirements and other changes are projected to cut nearly $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "One attendee named Cecilia, who said she was a constituent from Chico, stayed with the Medicaid topic and came prepared with statistics. \u201cHow do you justify voting yes on the big, ugly bill,\u201d she said, using a Democratic nickname for the Trump bill, \u201cknowing that 43% of your constituents \u2014 the highest of any California congressional district \u2014 received Medicaid and other government assistance?\u201d",
      "LaMalfa, who represents a safe GOP district and held five town halls over the summer recess, replied that changes to the Trump law could be made in the future. That would be an uphill fight, however, given how difficult it was for Republicans to pass the Trump legislation on a party-line basis.",
      "\u201cOK, so this bill is not going to be the be all, end all. \u2026 It\u2019s not the end of the discussion. It\u2019s not the end of the legislation,\u201d LaMalfa said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s bulls---!\u201d one attendee shot back.",
      "Democrats feel the heat on the party\u2019s direction after Trump\u2019s win",
      "Democratic lawmakers were also pressed about the direction of their party at several town halls. Attendees asked how Democrats will combat Trump\u2019s agenda and turn the party\u2019s trajectory around following the 2024 presidential election loss.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one running to save us,\u201d Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said of the Democratic Party to a crowd in Steamboat Springs. \u201cThere is no panacea. There\u2019s no master plan. It is about doing the work, developing and building coalitions.\u201d",
      "At several town halls, fellow Colorado Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Michael Bennet said that the Democratic Party \u201cshould have never lost\u201d the 2024 presidential election and called Trump\u2019s victory \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "Bennet added that Democrats must run on more than just opposition to Trump.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything, basically, that he didn\u2019t promise to do when he was running for office, which is part of the problem, when he built a majority coalition to get elected president and we couldn\u2019t stop it. Knowing what we know about it sitting in this room \u2026 we have to ask ourselves, \u2018Why are we not able to build a governing coalition to beat them either time?\u2019\u201d Bennet said.",
      "In Michigan, before an audience of mostly white seniors in a Republican district represented by Rep. Bill Huizenga, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., warned that young people are \u201cdisillusioned\u201d and feel \u201cleft out\u201d of Democratic politics. She emphasized that Democrats want to see a \u201cnew generation of leaders,\u201d pointing to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City.",
      "\u201c[Democrats] are willing to take someone new, or that they may not know a ton about, rather than the kind of warmed-over leftovers, right? And so, I think, to me, that signal couldn\u2019t be sent any clearer,\u201d she said.",
      "A Dem town hall is shut down over Gaza crisis",
      "The political handling of the ongoing war in Gaza continues to haunt Democrats, as constituents across the country continuously interrupted town halls to voice their anger at U.S. politicians for not doing more \u2014 and in one case, shut down the town hall.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., canceled his town hall after nine pro-Palestinian protesters \u201ctook over the stage, shouting and disrupting\u201d the ongoing event, according to the Renton Police Department. Smith posted on X that the behavior displayed by the protesters was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d calling it a \u201ccoordinated\u201d effort \u201cto shut down public dialogue\u201d and alleging that one of his staff was \u201cwas physically assaulted during the chaos.\u201d",
      "Three protesters at Smith\u2019s event were later arrested on trespassing charges, police said.",
      "A day later in Rhode Island, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., held a joint, two-hour town hall where they faced consistent disruptions and questions about their stances on Israel and Gaza.",
      "In July, Reed voted in favor of a resolution introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to prohibit the sale of certain assault rifles to Israel, but he voted against a second Sanders resolution that applied to bomb sales, which attendees reminded Reed of \u2014 through shouts of \u201cbut not bombs\u201d when the Rhode Island senator highlighted his vote.",
      "Magaziner didn\u2019t say how he would vote if a bill banning arms to Israel reached the House floor. Instead, he told the heated audience that he would \u201cjudge it through the lens of, how do we end the atrocities? What is the most effective way to do that?\u201d \u2014 an answer that did not seem to satisfy the crowd.",
      "Rep. Steven Cohen, D-Tenn., criticized Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Memphis town hall, mentioning that he did not attend Netanyahu\u2019s addresses to Congress in 2015 or 2024, and adding he has \u201cno respect\u201d for the Israeli leader.",
      "However, Cohen faced boos when he declined to say outright that there is a genocide in Gaza, instead saying the situation \u201chas some aspects of a genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a definition of genocide,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhether all the aspects are met. I do not know.\u201d",
      "Despite her staunchly progressive and pro-Palestinian record, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., still faced shouts of \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cyou are wrong\u201d for not denouncing defensive aid for Israel during her Seattle town hall in early August.",
      "Physical clashes but no major security breach",
      "The June assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman put lawmakers in both parties on edge. Security was top of mind for many lawmakers who opted to hold town halls.",
      "At their August events, they faced a barrage of boos and heckles, and were shouted down; Flood said he was greeted with middle fingers. But for the most part, the protests were peaceful.",
      "But there was one major clash between protesters and security at the end of a town hall hosted by freshman Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., who sparred with pro-Palestinian attendees throughout the two-hour event over his support for Israel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Missouri congressman, and the \u2018M\u2019 doesn\u2019t stand for the Middle East,\u201d said Bell, who ousted progressive Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., in a primary last year.",
      "As the St. Louis town hall ended, officials tried to clear the room, but some refused to leave. Video posted on social media shows police and private security personnel hired by Bell shoving protesters to the ground and grabbing one by the neck and hair.",
      "The St. Louis Police Department said on X that \u201cmany\u201d of the officers involved were not members of its department, so it couldn\u2019t discuss tactics. The department said it was not aware of any arrests. Asked about the altercation, a Bell spokesperson sent NBC News a statement that did not mention it explicitly: \u201cDespite the efforts of the protestors, he found it gratifying to engage with his constituents on the most pressing issues in their lives, and he will not shy away from holding more town halls in the future.\u201d",
      "Before holding a series of town halls in Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Josh Brecheen warned on X that anyone disrupting his events would be asked to leave or removed by law enforcement.",
      "Flood, the Nebraska Republican, takes a different approach. He said he follows security guidance from the House sergeant at arms whenever he hosts public events and that he coordinated with University of Nebraska police, who sent several officers to the town hall. But he told officers that he didn\u2019t want people removed from the town hall if they were expressing their opinion.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally screaming, flipping me off. They are jumping up and down. They are standing with their back to me,\u201d Flood recounted. \u201cNone of those folks get asked to leave.\u201d",
      "GOP Rep. Barry Moore, who is running for the Senate in Alabama, was also heckled and shouted down during his Wednesday town hall in Daphne. Things got really tense 40 minutes into the event, after Moore said noncitizens are not protected by \u201cdue process.\u201d",
      "\u201cFalse! Lies! \u2026 Shame! Shame!\u201d attendees shouted at him.",
      "Without saying another word, Moore withdrew to the back of the room, then slipped out a back door.",
      "\u201cBye, Felicia!\u201d a man yelled at Moore."

    "story": [
      "After a violinist who has played with high-profile orchestras was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week, members of Utah\u2019s music community are rallying in support of his release.",
      "Donggin Shin, 37, who came to the U.S. from South Korea with his father when he was a child, was abruptly arrested at a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado, his attorney Adam Crayk told NBC News. He was placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. With a hearing slated for early September, his colleagues from the Salt Lake City area are hoping to send a message to the administration and beyond that Shin, who goes by the name John, is a valued part of the community.",
      "\u201cJohn has been in this country since he was 10 years old and he was brought here by his parents. He didn\u2019t get a choice in the matter,\u201d violinist and conductor Gabriel Gordon said. \u201cHe is not somebody that is taking from the community, but is giving.\u201d",
      "A senior Department of Homeland Security official said in response to NBC News\u2019 questions about Shin, \u201cOur message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "Shin, who works a day job in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West, is currently being held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado, according to an ICE database \u2014 more than 500 miles away from his home.",
      "According to charging documents, Shin was identified by ICE\u2019s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered threats to national security. In Shin\u2019s case, the arrest was prompted by an old misdemeanor impaired driving offense that occurred while Shin was navigating his father\u2019s battle with brain cancer, Crayk said.",
      "\u201cWe are literally having fugitive ops and Homeland Security Investigations, which are two law enforcement agencies that focus on really terrible, terrible things, relegated now to looking for people like John,\u201d Crayk said.",
      "The senior DHS official did not elaborate on the details of Shin\u2019s arrest but noted that his history includes a DUI conviction.",
      "\u201cShin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on September 3, 1998,\u201d the official said in the statement. \u201cThis visa required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999.\u201d",
      "According to Crayk, DHS\u2019 account of Shin\u2019s immigration history omits some details. After Shin and his father entered the country on a tourist visa, his father eventually switched to a student visa, under which Shin, a dependent at the time, was also covered, the attorney said.",
      "Years later, Shin became a DACA recipient. However, due to the 2020 impaired driving conviction, Shin lost his DACA protections, leaving him without lawful status for the last four and a half years, Crayk said. Records show that Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense, served his probation and the matter was resolved.",
      "On the day of his arrest, his wife, DaNae Shin, with whom he has two stepchildren, received a panicked phone call, she wrote on social media. It happened to be her birthday, she said.",
      "\u201cI got a call from John-- \u2018Honey, I don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019ve been arrested by ICE and they are sending me to a detainment center. I love you and the kids, I will be okay, please call our attorney\u2019 and then he was rushed off the phone,\u201d Shin wrote. \u201cJohn is not a criminal, he is an amazing husband, father, and person, and I will do whatever it takes to bring him back home.\u201d",
      "While Shin has long been eligible for a green card, Crayk said his family was struggling financially and marriage-based green card fees run around $2,375.",
      "\u201cAt the time he married his wife, DaNae, his father died of brain cancer and his wife lost her job,\u201d Crayk said. \u201cSo they went through extreme financial crisis, and they\u2019ve been scrimping and saving since that time.\u201d",
      "Since hearing the news, Gordon and several other musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to continue doing so to raise awareness until Shin returns home. Gordon, a conductor and violinist for Ballet West, said he\u2019s known Shin for almost a decade and \u201cwould do anything\u201d for the fellow violinist and his family. He described Shin as a \u201ctop-shelf violinist.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible technique,\u201d said Gordon, who\u2019s also concertmaster of Chamber Orchestra Ogden. \u201cEven more than that, he takes his technique and brings his soul to it. He brings that joy of music-making to the entire community.\u201d",
      "Robert Baldwin, director of orchestras at the University of Utah, where he is also a professor, said he was shocked and angry at the news. Baldwin\u2019s friendship with Shin stretches back more than 15 years to when the violinist began his undergraduate studies at the school. Baldwin said that Shin showed grit early on.",
      "\u201cHe was not the top violinist when he arrived. He had a lot of raw talent, and he asked what he needed to do to be, for instance, in the top orchestra,\u201d Baldwin recalled. \u201cHe worked his way up. By the time he was a graduate student, he was the concertmaster, meaning the first violinist of the top orchestra.\u201d",
      "Baldwin also said that as Shin progressed, he attempted to create an inclusive environment for his fellow musicians.",
      "\u201cHe helped other students acclimate to university life, whether it was a freshman or a new graduate student,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI really like the fact that he didn\u2019t take a leadership role and just wear that as a badge and put himself on an ivory tower above everyone else.\u201d",
      "Gordon hopes Monday\u2019s performance in support of Shin conveys a clear message.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that all that we\u2019re doing is showing just how valuable he is to this community and why he belongs here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe absolutely belongs here.\u201d"

      "Those behind it insist this campaign to raise the English flag, known as St. George\u2019s Cross, is an expression of patriotism; others see the sudden prevalence of the banner, sometimes associated with soccer hooliganism and racism, as a hostile statement of surging far-right sentiment.",
      "The febrile debate went global this week when Elon Musk, the former adviser to President Donald Trump and backer of far-right movements globally, posted a picture of the flag on X. Vice President JD Vance also staged his latest intervention into British life, urging people to \u201cpush back against the crazies\u201d who criticize flying the flag.",
      "'Operation Raise the Colours'",
      "In a country where the national flag is rare outside of sporting events, the banners now fluttering above a highway here in Stevenage are typical of those popping up nationwide in recent weeks as part of the grassroots \u201cOperation Raise the Colours.\u201d",
      "The flags were put up here last week by a five-strong group including Louis Turvey, who read about the national movement on Facebook, where he said he gets most of his news.",
      "Turvey, 33, who has Roma-Gypsy heritage and was raised in London, 30 minutes away by train, says he was in no way motivated by far-right or hostile feelings. Rather he wanted to do something positive and fly his national flag \u201clike you see on holiday in Greece or Spain,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, hipster moustache, low-buttoned shirt and a single earing, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell you know what, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",
      "He met his fellow flaggers through his online handle \"Stevenage Patriots\" and had never met them before, he said. \u201cI\u2019m gay and a lot of my friends are girls, so I was quite nervous hanging around with four straight lads,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it was such a lovely evening, quite spiritual actually, quite calming.\u201d",
      "However he soon experienced just how charged this debate has become when, just as his group was packing up, someone threw two Molotov cocktails at them, the second cutting Turvey\u2019s head and covering his face with blood. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he said, visibly shaken by an incident he says has put a pause on his flag-hoisting activities for the time being at least.",
      "Critics see darker forces undergirding the broader flag campaign.",
      "They view this groundswell as little more than an aggressive, provocative message to people with an immigrant background and nonwhite residents.",
      "The anti-racist campaign group Hope Not Hate reported that the founders of Operation Raise the Colours include \u201cwell-known far-right extremists\u201d and allies of Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who has become a leading nationalist voice in Britain. Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",
      "These fears are widespread. When a St. George\u2019s Cross was painted on the wall of St. John the Baptist church, in the town of Lincoln, the vicar, Rachel Heskins, saw it as a clear \u201cattempt to intimidate\u201d the diverse local community.",
      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",
      "National identity in Britain is doubly complicated because the United Kingdom includes the nations of England, Wales and Scotland, and the province of Northern Ireland. During the soccer World Cup and on some public holidays, England\u2019s banner is widely used by people of all political and demographic stripes, but outside of those events it has been co-opted by nationalists, the far-right and even fascists.",
      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",
      "That\u2019s certainly the experience of Moj, 44, a Briton with Bangladeshi heritage, sitting with his 11-year-old daughter in Stevenage\u2019s faded postwar town square.",
      "\u201cI remember being a kid and getting called all sorts of racist names. I don\u2019t get that anymore,\u201d said Moj, who like many in this town of 80,000 declined to give his second name for fear of local backlash.",
      "Despite the improvement, the flag still holds negative connotations for him. \u201dIn certain areas, if I see an English flag, there is always a part of me that thinks, OK, I've got to be a bit careful here,\u201d he said.",
      "Stevenage was dreamed up in 1946 as an example of \u201cnew town\u201d modernism, an integrated residential-commercial space in which to house families scattered by war. Today \u2014 despite a much needed \u00a31 billion ($1.35 billion) regeneration scheme on the way \u2014 its faded pebbledash and dated glass shopfronts feel like a cipher for modern Britain.",
      "As is the case across the West, many Britons are increasingly concerned and angry about rising prices, decrepit public services, a lack of housing \u2014 and the perception that immigration has been mismanaged.",
      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future. Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",
      "At first, he thought the blood running down his face was acid (acid attacks are on the rise in the U.K.), and he said the incident has only added to the chronic anxiety stemming from a homophobic attack in 2018.",
      "Though he decries any form of racism or negativity associated with the flag movement, he says that part of his motivation stemmed from the perception that the current Labour government \u201cis not siding with English people\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s probably why people are so upset at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% of the vote in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that, although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population . At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",
      "And so, amid all this, up goes the English flag.",
      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katawala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"

      "A silent heart disease risk factor may explain why some women end up having heart attacks and strokes despite seeming like they are healthy, a new study suggests.",
      "The analysis of 30 years of data from more than 12,000 women revealed that inflammation was comparable to high LDL cholesterol as a heart disease risk factor, researchers reported Friday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress meeting in Madrid. The results were simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.",
      "Measuring inflammation is not a standard part of screening in the United States and there are no outward signs that a person may have high levels.",
      "Inflammation can raise a woman\u2019s risk of a heart attack or stroke even when other risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, smoking status and high blood pressure \u2014 aren\u2019t an issue, said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Paul Ridker, a preventive cardiologist at Mass General Brigham and Women\u2019s Heart and Vascular Institute and a professor of medicine at the Harvard University Medical School.",
      "\u201cHalf of all heart attacks and strokes occur in people who do not have any major risk factors,\u201d Ridker said.",

      "\u201cDespite a growing body of evidence that inflammation is an incredibly important cardiovascular risk factor and the recommendation that most should be screened, the vast majority of women are not being screened,\u201d said Hausvater, who was not involved with the research.",
      "An inexpensive blood test for what\u2019s known as high-sensitivity CRP can measure inflammation. Ridker said that in Europe it\u2019s already the standard of care to measure hsCRP.",
      "The new study used data from the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was launched by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the early 1990s.",
      "At the outset, blood samples were collected from the women to measure cholesterol and hsCRP levels.",
      "Of the nearly 28,000 women who provided a baseline blood test, 12,530 had no standard modifiable risk factors for heart disease, or \u201cSMuRFs.\u201d During 30 years of follow-up, there were 973 cardiovascular events \u2014 such as a heart attack or stroke \u2014 in this group. Levels of hsCRP were significantly higher among women who experienced them.",
      "The new findings indicate that inflammation should be included in heart disease screenings, Ridker said. High inflammation can be treated with statins, but with a healthy cholesterol reading, these women would not qualify for a statin prescription.",
      "A previous clinical trial found that women who do not have the standard modifiable risk factors could benefit from treatment with statins. That trial showed that women with high inflammation but no other risk factors saw a 38% reduction in serious cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack if they received statin therapy, Ridker said.",
      "But if hsCRP isn\u2019t measured, these women won\u2019t get the lifesaving treatment they need, Ridker said. \u201cThe bottom line is that physicians will not treat what they don\u2019t measure,\u201d he said.",
      "Hausvater said that screening should be routine for all women.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool women should be offered to assess their risk,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say, based on this study, I would recommend that patients ask their physicians to check their hsCRP.\u201d",
      "Dr. Tania Ruiz, a cardiologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, agreed. \u201cThis is a very exciting study,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first large-scale study of hsCRP as a predictor of cardiovascular events in otherwise healthy women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve learned more about the role of inflammation in the formation of plaques and plaque vulnerability,\u201d Ruiz said.",
      "Women with autoimmune diseases such as lupus may be more likely to have a high hsCRP score, Ruiz said. Otherwise, without testing, there\u2019s no way to know."

    "summary": "Packed into a gritty, bare-bones music venue on the edge of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, on a Sunday in July, about 500 fans of Bay Area rapper LaRussell were taken to church.",
    "story": [
      "Packed into a gritty, bare-bones music venue on the edge of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, on a Sunday in July, about 500 fans of Bay Area rapper LaRussell were taken to church. Except there was no pastor or choir and no pews. Instead it was a 2 p.m. show for independent artist LaRussell, spreading his own gospel through catchy dance music and clever wordplay.",
      "\u201cBrooklyn, I\u2019m ho-ome,\u201d LaRussell exclaimed with his distinctive West Coast flare.",
      "And while a midday hip-hop show may seem unusual, it reflects LaRussell\u2019s approach \u2014 doing things his way and allowing others to adapt.",
      "\u201cYou cultivate a completely different experience,\u201d LaRussell said ahead of the performance. \u201cI have every age there from 1 to 100. Granny not coming out at 10 p.m., and you don\u2019t want the little homies out at 10 p.m. \u201d",
      "The \u201cGive Me a Beat\u201d artist\u2019s playful, community-centered approach to his art \u2014 and business \u2014 has fans coming to shows again and again, paying for his music, and even bidding for his time. And the millions upon millions of streams on music platforms come without the backing of a record label.",
      "Instead, LaRussell and his small team handle everything on their own: uploading songs to streamers, booking shows that they set up and tear down, social media promotion and even selling merch at events. Emailing the rapper\u2019s management often yields a response from LaRussell himself. He said this way of operating comes from years of making something out of nothing.\u201cI wasn\u2019t independent because I didn\u2019t want to sign and I didn\u2019t like the labels,\u201d he said. \u201cI was independent because I didn\u2019t have no other option.\u201d",
      "Using a sliding scale and offer-based model, LaRussell has created a system where fans can decide what value his art has to them. Supporters can bid on items ranging from concert tickets to tour merchandise, while other artists can submit offers to collaborate on songs. Bidding for tickets to most of his shows starts at $1 and goes up from there (though donations of at least $100 are suggested). However, LaRussell and his team can counter if they don\u2019t approve. He doesn\u2019t accept less than $500 for a song feature \u2014 but because he spends no more than 15 minutes on any song he writes, the profit can add up quickly.",
      "Three hours before the Brooklyn show, LaRussell joined a freestyle rap exhibition, or cypher, on the sidewalk in front of the venue with a local podcast duo that had booked him in the weeks leading up to the concert.Fans can even buy stock in the royalties of specific songs, or bid on various experiences like wedding appearances, seminars or a game of pickleball \u2014 a game at which he swears he is hard to beat.",
      "LaRussell said he was inspired by the late rapper and fellow Californian Nipsey Hussle\u2019s \u201cProud to Pay\u201d offer-based model. In 2013, Hussle sold 1,000 physical copies of a mixtape for $100 each in less than 24 hours, effectively making $100,000 overnight. LaRussell wasn\u2019t too sure about asking fans for so much cash and instead took the opposite route.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know a bunch of people who had $100 to spend on an album, so I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to let them pay me anything,\u2019 because I got zero dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if they give me $1, I am up. It really helped me build the base and establish the infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The community he's built continues to pour back into LaRussell and his piggy bank. On Thursday, the rapper launched his own \u201cProud 2 Pay\u201d initiative where, for $1,000, supporters get a \u201cBackyard Show Experience,\u201d which includes an intimate show, unlimited access to future backyard shows, a tour of his childhood home and more. In less than 24 hours, the rapper said he sold 67 tickets.",
      "That foundation from his career\u2019s inception has evolved into a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that rivals some of the biggest musical artists of the last decade. To date, LaRussell has collaborated on songs with hip-hop titans including Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and Lil Jon, has publicly released 40 albums since 2018 and amassed more than 100 million global streams, according to Songstats, a music analytics site.",
      "And he owns all of his music and intellectual property through Good Compenny, both a label and a creative company he founded in 2016 to pursue his own art and help others around him do the same. Everything from content creation to song production and merchandise shipping can happen inside a building in his hometown of Vallejo, California, bearing the business\u2019 name, a play on seeing the value in a coin some people discard.",
      "\u201cThem pennies add up,\u201d said LaRussell.",
      "So far, LaRussell said, he\u2019s made millions of dollars off of music, something he\u2019s proud and humbled by. But he admits he has loftier goals that keep him hungry, even if his decisions invite financial and creative risks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a different roller coaster when you\u2019re independent because you\u2019re constantly taking risks for a reward that you see in your head that may not be something that looks completely tangible yet, but you have to just go with what you feel,\u201d he said.",
      "While he\u2019s not the first indie artist to wade into mainstream success, LaRussell continues to be one of the most savvy of this era. Predecessors like KRS-One and Chance the Rapper gained international fame, while regional performers like Devine Carama of Lexington, Kentucky, who\u2019s been a full-time independent artist for the last two decades, have crafted their own paths to success.",
      "Carama points to LaRussell\u2019s ability to build a fan base \u201cthat loves and supports you \u2014 not just your music, but you.\u201d",
      "Carama, a community activist who teaches a class called \u201cLeadership & Lyricism: Hip-Hop & Community Change\u201d at the University of Kentucky, has seen the industry change time and again. From personally selling CDs from the trunk of his car in the early 2000s to the current era of streaming, Carama said the medium may change, but he believes community being at the core of the culture has not wavered.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to be a hip-hop artist and not be connected to the community that you come from and somehow using the culture to give back,\u201d he said.",
      "For LaRussell, shows range from intimate experiences at lounges with a couple hundred people to larger performances at major venues with a few thousand. In the last year alone, he\u2019s hosted an NPR Tiny Desk Concert, performed at this year\u2019s NBA All-Star weekend and created this season\u2019s anthem for the San Francisco Giants.",
      "But, LaRussell said, none of it means anything without being able to give back to the people who support him.",
      "One family of three from California \u2014 mom, dad and teenage son \u2014  was attending its 28th LaRussell show together that afternoon in Brooklyn. They were second in line for the show, as eager, they said, as the first time they saw their favorite artist perform.",
      "\u201cIt feels great supporting people that are putting good energy out and being direct to the artist,\u201d said Noah Kahn.",
      "His wife and son nodded in agreement.",
      "Katie Kahn added, \u201cWe\u2019re part of the family now.\u201d"

      "With a birthday cake in hand, well-known Dominican Republic comedian Carlos S\u00e1nchez recounted in an Instagram post how 25-year-old Winifer N\u00fa\u00f1ez Beato died in 2021 after doctors on the island refused to end her high-risk pregnancy because of the country\u2019s total abortion ban.",
      "N\u00fa\u00f1ez Beato left behind a husband and a young daughter. In the video, S\u00e1nchez said the cake is not for his birthday, but rather to mark another year where he\u2019s asking for women not to die because of a law that stops doctors from saving their lives.",
      "S\u00e1nchez told NBC News he felt compelled to use his platform to raise awareness because \u201cit\u2019s a barbarity that in this day and age a mother has to put her life at risk over a risky pregnancy that could be ended but the law prohibits doctors to do so.\u201d",
      "S\u00e1nchez is among many artists and activists in the Dominican Republic taking part in a social media campaign to push for amending a recently passed penal code that maintains a complete ban on abortion. Many artists have used their platforms to tell the stories of Dominican women who have lost their lives to pregnancy-related conditions.",
      "On Instagram, singer and actress Techy Fatule tells the story of Damaris Mejia, who went to three different hospitals when she started feeling ill and had a high fever. According to Fatule, medical personnel didn\u2019t know what to do with Mejia\u2019s high-risk pregnancy. She was sent home with painkillers and died that night. Fatule says doctors couldn\u2019t save her because of the ban, and ends with words, \u201cLife is full of exceptions.\u201d",
      "The Dominican Republic is a conservative country that features the Bible on its flag. The country signed a concordat, or agreement, with the Vatican in 1954 making Catholicism the state religion, though the constitution allows freedom of worship.",
      "The country\u2019s Catholic Church backs the abortion ban, as well as evangelical groups. But Alianza Cristiana Dominicana, a group formed in 2017 by women of different Christian denominations, is pushing for the penal code to include what are known in the region as the \u201ctres causales,\u201d or three causes or circumstances where ending pregnancies should be allowed: when the woman\u2019s life is at risk, in the case of rape or incest, and when fetal malformations are incompatible with life. The \u201ctres causales\u201d are used in other countries throughout Latin America that have eased total bans on abortion.",
      "Alianza Cristiana Dominicana has partnered with the artists to share the stories.",
      "So far this year, there have been 100 documented maternal deaths in the Dominican Republic. Natalia M\u00e1rmol, of the Coalition for Women\u2019s Lives and Rights, believes those lives could have been saved if abortions were legal.",
      "\u201cThis is a fight to guarantee minimum protection for life, health and dignity for girls and women,\u201d said M\u00e1rmol. \u201cWe are asking for minimal protections, so women don\u2019t die on a hospital bed. So a 13- or 15-year-old girl is not obliged to continue with a pregnancy that is the product of a rape. And so a woman can decide when a pregnancy is not viable.\u201d",
      "The Dominican Republic\u2019s previous penal code had been in place since 1884, and efforts to reform it failed for decades. The new penal code was approved by legislators and signed into law by President Luis Abinader.",
      "Abinader had previously expressed support for making exceptions to the abortion ban, but after winning re-election he didn\u2019t push for changes.",
      "After the vote, Abinader said the penal code, which covers many types of crime, \u201cis not the ideal but it\u2019s the best possible, since among other things, it substitutes legislation that dates back to 1884.\u201d",
      "M\u00e1rmol said the new penal code does include points that the group advocated for, like the classification of femicide, the intentional killing of a woman or girl, as well as an increase in the severity of punishment for sexual assault.",
      "She said the new penal code does not go into effect until August 2026 and there is time to tweak the law to include the three exceptions.",
      "The Coalition for the Life and Rights of Women and other groups have pushed for years to have the three exceptions included, even erecting a camp in 2021 in front of the National Palace to pressure parliament.",
      "In the Dominican Republic, women face up to two years in prison for having an abortion and doctors and midwives can receive five to 20 years for terminating a pregnancy.",
      "Four other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean maintain a total prohibition on abortion, including Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Most of Latin America and the Caribbean allows abortion in limited cases.",
      "Caribbean-pop singer and songwriter Isabel de Dios said she has been active in the feminist movement throughout her adulthood, often taking part in protests. Her first song, called \u201cColonizado,\u201d or \u201cColonized,\u201d talks about how society expects people to stay within established roles and turns a blind eye to many situations.",
      "She called the penal code \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cdictatorial\u201d and \u201cfeudal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat kind of society are we constructing?\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "After a violinist who has played with high-profile orchestras was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week, members of Utah\u2019s music community are rallying in support of his release.",
      "Donggin Shin, 37, who came to the U.S. from South Korea with his father when he was a child, was abruptly arrested at a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado, his attorney Adam Crayk told NBC News. He was placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. With a hearing slated for early September, his colleagues from the Salt Lake City area are hoping to send a message to the administration and beyond that Shin, who goes by the name John, is a valued part of the community.",
      "\u201cJohn has been in this country since he was 10 years old and he was brought here by his parents. He didn\u2019t get a choice in the matter,\u201d violinist and conductor Gabriel Gordon said. \u201cHe is not somebody that is taking from the community, but is giving.\u201d",
      "A senior Department of Homeland Security official said in response to NBC News\u2019 questions about Shin, \u201cOur message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "Shin, who works a day job in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West, is currently being held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado, according to an ICE database \u2014 more than 500 miles away from his home.",
      "According to charging documents, Shin was identified by ICE\u2019s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered threats to national security. In Shin\u2019s case, the arrest was prompted by an old misdemeanor impaired driving offense that occurred while Shin was navigating his father\u2019s battle with brain cancer, Crayk said.",
      "\u201cWe are literally having fugitive ops and Homeland Security Investigations, which are two law enforcement agencies that focus on really terrible, terrible things, relegated now to looking for people like John,\u201d Crayk said.",
      "The senior DHS official did not elaborate on the details of Shin\u2019s arrest but noted that his history includes a DUI conviction.",
      "\u201cShin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on September 3, 1998,\u201d the official said in the statement. \u201cThis visa required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999.\u201d",
      "According to Crayk, DHS\u2019 account of Shin\u2019s immigration history omits some details. After Shin and his father entered the country on a tourist visa, his father eventually switched to a student visa, under which Shin, a dependent at the time, was also covered, the attorney said.",
      "Years later, Shin became a DACA recipient. However, due to the 2020 impaired driving conviction, Shin lost his DACA protections, leaving him without lawful status for the last four and a half years, Crayk said. Records show that Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense, served his probation and the matter was resolved.",
      "On the day of his arrest, his wife, DaNae Shin, with whom he has two stepchildren, received a panicked phone call, she wrote on social media. It happened to be her birthday, she said.",
      "\u201cI got a call from John-- \u2018Honey, I don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019ve been arrested by ICE and they are sending me to a detainment center. I love you and the kids, I will be okay, please call our attorney\u2019 and then he was rushed off the phone,\u201d Shin wrote. \u201cJohn is not a criminal, he is an amazing husband, father, and person, and I will do whatever it takes to bring him back home.\u201d",
      "While Shin has long been eligible for a green card, Crayk said his family was struggling financially and marriage-based green card fees run around $2,375.",
      "\u201cAt the time he married his wife, DaNae, his father died of brain cancer and his wife lost her job,\u201d Crayk said. \u201cSo they went through extreme financial crisis, and they\u2019ve been scrimping and saving since that time.\u201d",
      "Since hearing the news, Gordon and several other musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to continue doing so to raise awareness until Shin returns home. Gordon, a conductor and violinist for Ballet West, said he\u2019s known Shin for almost a decade and \u201cwould do anything\u201d for the fellow violinist and his family. He described Shin as a \u201ctop-shelf violinist.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible technique,\u201d said Gordon, who\u2019s also concertmaster of Chamber Orchestra Ogden. \u201cEven more than that, he takes his technique and brings his soul to it. He brings that joy of music-making to the entire community.\u201d",
      "Robert Baldwin, director of orchestras at the University of Utah, where he is also a professor, said he was shocked and angry at the news. Baldwin\u2019s friendship with Shin stretches back more than 15 years to when the violinist began his undergraduate studies at the school. Baldwin said that Shin showed grit early on.",
      "\u201cHe was not the top violinist when he arrived. He had a lot of raw talent, and he asked what he needed to do to be, for instance, in the top orchestra,\u201d Baldwin recalled. \u201cHe worked his way up. By the time he was a graduate student, he was the concertmaster, meaning the first violinist of the top orchestra.\u201d",
      "Baldwin also said that as Shin progressed, he attempted to create an inclusive environment for his fellow musicians.",
      "\u201cHe helped other students acclimate to university life, whether it was a freshman or a new graduate student,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI really like the fact that he didn\u2019t take a leadership role and just wear that as a badge and put himself on an ivory tower above everyone else.\u201d",
      "Gordon hopes Monday\u2019s performance in support of Shin conveys a clear message.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that all that we\u2019re doing is showing just how valuable he is to this community and why he belongs here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe absolutely belongs here.\u201d"

      "The ban comes as several U.S. allies have declared they would recognize a Palestinian state at the gathering of world leaders at the U.N. headquarters in New York in response to Israel\u2019s escalating assault in northern Gaza, which intensified Friday after the country announced it had begun the \u201cinitial stages\u201d of its operation in the famine-gripped area.",
      "Headed by Abbas, who has not faced an election in almost two decades, the Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It has not governed in Gaza since 2007 when the Palestinian president's security forces were driven out by the Islamic militant group Hamas.",

      "Under a 1947 U.N. \u201cheadquarters agreement,\u201d the U.S. is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the U.N. in New York.

      "But Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N. told reporters Friday that as far as he knew, \u201cthe head of our delegation is President Mahmoud Abbas, and he is coming to represent the state of Palestine and the Palestinian people in that conference.\u201d",
      "On the visa revocations, he added, \u201cWe will see exactly what it means and how it applies to any of our delegation, and we will respond accordingly.\u201d",

      "The visa revocations came amid mounting global anger over starvation in Gaza after more than 22 months of war which has seen more than 63,000 people killed, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "After launching a fresh assault on the north of the enclave earlier this week, Israel said Friday that Gaza City had become a dangerous combat zone.",

      "\u201cCanadians were already concerned over their personal finances, but they\u2019ve taken the rhetoric and policy announcements from the U.S. administration very personally,\u201d said Amir Eylon, president and CEO of market research firm Longwoods International, which has been regularly surveying Canadian consumers.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, things have gone from bad to worse,\u201d he added.",
      "A whopping 80% of Canadian travelers whose travel decisions are being influenced by U.S. policy and politics say U.S. tariffs and economic policy are the major negative influence. Seventy-one percent say political statements by U.S. leaders are a key negative factor, up from 64% in April, according to Longwoods International\u2019s mid-July survey.",
      "Instead of visiting the United States, where AAA says Labor Day weekend travelers will be enjoying lower year-over-year prices for everything from gas, hotels and flights to car rental costs, disgruntled Canadians are planning to travel within their own country or book flights to other nations.",

      "It is not just Canadians who are staying away.",
      "Geopolitical and policy-related concerns have also led to a decrease in visitors from Western Europe and Asia, experts say. Overseas arrivals to the U.S. dropped three months in a row, including a 3.1% drop in July, bringing the year-to-date decline to 1.6%, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "Overall, the \u201csentiment drag has proven severe,\u201d the group said in a data update released last week. In December, it had forecast an approximate 9% increase in overall international arrivals to the United States for 2025. It now expects an 8.2% decline.",
      "Overseas visitor numbers throughout the United States may dip even further due to the $250 visa integrity fee set to go into effect on Oct. 1. The new charge would be layered on top of other visa fees and apply to most anyone applying for a nonimmigrant visa for travel to the United States, including visitors from China, Mexico and Brazil.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association calls it \u201ca misguided junk fee\u201d that will hike the upfront costs of visiting the U.S. by 130% just as the cities across the country already reeling from the loss of international visitors are preparing for major global events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup, America\u2019s 250th birthday and the 2028 Summer Olympics.",
      "The fee, part of Trump's signature tax and spending law, requires coordination across agencies before it's implemented, said a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, who defended the measure. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore to our nation\u2019s immigration system.\"",

      "Rochester\u2019s tourist attractions include the George Eastman Museum, the Strong National Museum of Play and the National Susan B. Anthony Museum & House. The city\u2019s summer and fall tourism promotion plans have shifted from traditional tourism marketing messages to a \u201csofter\u201d approach, Laber Pulvino said, including a \u201cDear Canada\u201d campaign launched earlier this summer.",
      "\u201cIt is essentially a love letter to our neighbors to the north. Our message is simple: When you\u2019re ready, we will be here,\u201d she said.",
      "Canadians made 20.4 million visits to the United States in 2024.

      "It was the central focus of questions at Wisconsin GOP Rep. Bryan Steil\u2019s town hall in late July, as attendees lambasted the congressman\u2019s efforts to blame former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies for the country\u2019s immigration problems.",
      "\u201cWhat I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, and you have not raised a voice to complain about it,\u201d one attendee told Steil. \u201cWhere do I see your leadership? I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The biggest crowd reactions of the night came in response to Steil\u2019s introductory remarks celebrating border security, which then prompted an attendee to shout, \u201cWe are all immigrants.\u201d",
      "In Virginia in late July, frustrations surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s handling of immigration pulled focus away from Social Security and Medicaid at Democratic Rep. Jennifer McClellan\u2019s town hall geared toward senior citizens.",
      "While McClellan directed attendees to keep their questions geared toward senior issues, the audience asked more questions about immigration than any other subject, expressing concerns about deportations and immigration raids. Among the only times McClellan drew applause where when she condemned the Trump administration\u2019s handling of deportations and its use of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a migrant detention center in Florida that a federal judge has ordered closed.",
      "\u201cI hope that when we enforce our immigration policy \u2014 whether it\u2019s who we detain, who we deport \u2014 that we do so consistent with American values of due process and compassion,\u201d McClellan said.",
      "Following the town hall in North Chesterfield, McClellan told NBC News she had expected immigration to be a recurring topic because of recent ICE activity in her district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been so much ICE activity here in Chesterfield County that\u2019s impacted people of all ages,\u201d McClellan said, adding that \u201cpeople of all walks of life have \u2026 reached out and said they\u2019re concerned about it.\u201d",
      "Democrats\u2019 focus on GOP Medicaid cuts seems to be working",
      "A month after Trump signed his sweeping \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d into law, its nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, and health care more broadly, dominated some GOP town halls \u2014 a sign that Democrats\u2019 early messaging on the legislation is having its desired effect.",
      "Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said his office had been inundated with calls about the cuts in the bill he voted for, so he decided to address the issue head-on during a town hall in Lincoln on Aug. 4.",
      "\u201cMedicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid \u2014 that was the No. 1 issue,\u201d Flood, the chairman of Republicans\u2019 Main Street Caucus, told NBC News.",
      "He said he spent a good deal of his event trying to explain to people on Medicare \u2014 which provides health care for seniors, while Medicaid is for low-income people \u2014 that their coverage would not be cut under the GOP legislation. \u201cIt didn\u2019t touch Medicare,\u201d he told attendees.",
      "The law imposes new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for able-bodied adults, ages 19 to 64, who receive Medicaid benefits.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got the bejesus scared out of them,\u201d Flood said in a phone interview, referring to what he described as an audience of mostly seniors. \u201cThey think that they\u2019re going to lose their health care, you know? And that\u2019s not the case.\u201d",
      "Flood conceded to the audience at the University of Nebraska that the Trump bill wasn\u2019t perfect but argued it cut taxes, would \u201cprovide certainty\u201d for Americans and \u201cprotects Medicaid\u201d by shoring up the program. Responding to other questions, Flood said one way to bring down the cost of health insurance was to \u201cnot have as many people on Medicaid.\u201d He also told the crowd the country \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d Medicare for All.",
      "Some replied by chanting \u201cYes, you can!\u201d while others booed and jeered Flood.",
      "Across the country in another college town, Chico, California, Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa was also getting an earful about the Medicaid cuts in Trump\u2019s big bill. LaMalfa responded by echoing GOP leaders, who have insisted the tax and spending cuts act doesn\u2019t cut Medicaid but simply \u201creforms\u201d it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not cuts for Medicaid,\u201d LaMalfa said, sparking an emotional reaction from the crowd.",
      "The new work requirements and other changes are projected to cut nearly $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "One attendee named Cecilia, who said she was a constituent from Chico, stayed with the Medicaid topic and came prepared with statistics. \u201cHow do you justify voting yes on the big, ugly bill,\u201d she said, using a Democratic nickname for the Trump bill, \u201cknowing that 43% of your constituents \u2014 the highest of any California congressional district \u2014 received Medicaid and other government assistance?\u201d",
      "LaMalfa, who represents a safe GOP district and held five town halls over the summer recess, replied that changes to the Trump law could be made in the future. That would be an uphill fight, however, given how difficult it was for Republicans to pass the Trump legislation on a party-line basis.",
      "\u201cOK, so this bill is not going to be the be all, end all. \u2026 It\u2019s not the end of the discussion. It\u2019s not the end of the legislation,\u201d LaMalfa said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s bulls---!\u201d one attendee shot back.",
      "Democrats feel the heat on the party\u2019s direction after Trump\u2019s win",
      "Democratic lawmakers were also pressed about the direction of their party at several town halls. Attendees asked how Democrats will combat Trump\u2019s agenda and turn the party\u2019s trajectory around following the 2024 presidential election loss.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one running to save us,\u201d Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said of the Democratic Party to a crowd in Steamboat Springs. \u201cThere is no panacea. There\u2019s no master plan. It is about doing the work, developing and building coalitions.\u201d",
      "At several town halls, fellow Colorado Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Michael Bennet said that the Democratic Party \u201cshould have never lost\u201d the 2024 presidential election and called Trump\u2019s victory \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "Bennet added that Democrats must run on more than just opposition to Trump.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything, basically, that he didn\u2019t promise to do when he was running for office, which is part of the problem, when he built a majority coalition to get elected president and we couldn\u2019t stop it. Knowing what we know about it sitting in this room \u2026 we have to ask ourselves, \u2018Why are we not able to build a governing coalition to beat them either time?\u2019\u201d Bennet said.",
      "In Michigan, before an audience of mostly white seniors in a Republican district represented by Rep. Bill Huizenga, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., warned that young people are \u201cdisillusioned\u201d and feel \u201cleft out\u201d of Democratic politics. She emphasized that Democrats want to see a \u201cnew generation of leaders,\u201d pointing to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City.",
      "\u201c[Democrats] are willing to take someone new, or that they may not know a ton about, rather than the kind of warmed-over leftovers, right? And so, I think, to me, that signal couldn\u2019t be sent any clearer,\u201d she said.",
      "A Dem town hall is shut down over Gaza crisis",
      "The political handling of the ongoing war in Gaza continues to haunt Democrats, as constituents across the country continuously interrupted town halls to voice their anger at U.S. politicians for not doing more \u2014 and in one case, shut down the town hall.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., canceled his town hall after nine pro-Palestinian protesters \u201ctook over the stage, shouting and disrupting\u201d the ongoing event, according to the Renton Police Department. Smith posted on X that the behavior displayed by the protesters was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d calling it a \u201ccoordinated\u201d effort \u201cto shut down public dialogue\u201d and alleging that one of his staff was \u201cwas physically assaulted during the chaos.\u201d",
      "Three protesters at Smith\u2019s event were later arrested on trespassing charges, police said.",
      "A day later in Rhode Island, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., held a joint, two-hour town hall where they faced consistent disruptions and questions about their stances on Israel and Gaza.",
      "In July, Reed voted in favor of a resolution introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to prohibit the sale of certain assault rifles to Israel, but he voted against a second Sanders resolution that applied to bomb sales, which attendees reminded Reed of \u2014 through shouts of \u201cbut not bombs\u201d when the Rhode Island senator highlighted his vote.",
      "Magaziner didn\u2019t say how he would vote if a bill banning arms to Israel reached the House floor. Instead, he told the heated audience that he would \u201cjudge it through the lens of, how do we end the atrocities? What is the most effective way to do that?\u201d \u2014 an answer that did not seem to satisfy the crowd.",
      "Rep. Steven Cohen, D-Tenn., criticized Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Memphis town hall, mentioning that he did not attend Netanyahu\u2019s addresses to Congress in 2015 or 2024, and adding he has \u201cno respect\u201d for the Israeli leader.",
      "However, Cohen faced boos when he declined to say outright that there is a genocide in Gaza, instead saying the situation \u201chas some aspects of a genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a definition of genocide,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhether all the aspects are met. I do not know.\u201d",
      "Despite her staunchly progressive and pro-Palestinian record, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., still faced shouts of \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cyou are wrong\u201d for not denouncing defensive aid for Israel during her Seattle town hall in early August.",
      "Physical clashes but no major security breach",
      "The June assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman put lawmakers in both parties on edge. Security was top of mind for many lawmakers who opted to hold town halls.",
      "At their August events, they faced a barrage of boos and heckles, and were shouted down; Flood said he was greeted with middle fingers. But for the most part, the protests were peaceful.",
      "But there was one major clash between protesters and security at the end of a town hall hosted by freshman Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., who sparred with pro-Palestinian attendees throughout the two-hour event over his support for Israel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Missouri congressman, and the \u2018M\u2019 doesn\u2019t stand for the Middle East,\u201d said Bell, who ousted progressive Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., in a primary last year.",
      "As the St. Louis town hall ended, officials tried to clear the room, but some refused to leave. Video posted on social media shows police and private security personnel hired by Bell shoving protesters to the ground and grabbing one by the neck and hair.",
      "The St. Louis Police Department said on X that \u201cmany\u201d of the officers involved were not members of its department, so it couldn\u2019t discuss tactics. The department said it was not aware of any arrests. Asked about the altercation, a Bell spokesperson sent NBC News a statement that did not mention it explicitly: \u201cDespite the efforts of the protestors, he found it gratifying to engage with his constituents on the most pressing issues in their lives, and he will not shy away from holding more town halls in the future.\u201d",
      "Before holding a series of town halls in Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Josh Brecheen warned on X that anyone disrupting his events would be asked to leave or removed by law enforcement.",
      "Flood, the Nebraska Republican, takes a different approach. He said he follows security guidance from the House sergeant at arms whenever he hosts public events and that he coordinated with University of Nebraska police, who sent several officers to the town hall. But he told officers that he didn\u2019t want people removed from the town hall if they were expressing their opinion.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally screaming, flipping me off. They are jumping up and down. They are standing with their back to me,\u201d Flood recounted. \u201cNone of those folks get asked to leave.\u201d",
      "GOP Rep. Barry Moore, who is running for the Senate in Alabama, was also heckled and shouted down during his Wednesday town hall in Daphne. Things got really tense 40 minutes into the event, after Moore said noncitizens are not protected by \u201cdue process.\u201d",
      "\u201cFalse! Lies! \u2026 Shame! Shame!\u201d attendees shouted at him.",
      "Without saying another word, Moore withdrew to the back of the room, then slipped out a back door.",
      "\u201cBye, Felicia!\u201d a man yelled at Moore."

      "A silent heart disease risk factor may explain why some women end up having heart attacks and strokes despite seeming like they are healthy, a new study suggests.",
      "The analysis of 30 years of data from more than 12,000 women revealed that inflammation was comparable to high LDL cholesterol as a heart disease risk factor, researchers reported Friday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress meeting in Madrid. The results were simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.",
      "Measuring inflammation is not a standard part of screening in the United States and there are no outward signs that a person may have high levels.",
      "Inflammation can raise a woman\u2019s risk of a heart attack or stroke even when other risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, smoking status and high blood pressure \u2014 aren\u2019t an issue, said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Paul Ridker, a preventive cardiologist at Mass General Brigham and Women\u2019s Heart and Vascular Institute and a professor of medicine at the Harvard University Medical School.",
      "\u201cHalf of all heart attacks and strokes occur in people who do not have any major risk factors,\u201d Ridker said.",
      "Dr. Anais Hausvater, a cardiologist and co-director of the Cardio-Obstetrics Research Program at NYU Langone Health, called the study \u201cpotentially practice changing.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite a growing body of evidence that inflammation is an incredibly important cardiovascular risk factor and the recommendation that most should be screened, the vast majority of women are not being screened,\u201d said Hausvater, who was not involved with the research.",
      "An inexpensive blood test for what\u2019s known as high-sensitivity CRP can measure inflammation. Ridker said that in Europe it\u2019s already the standard of care to measure hsCRP.",
      "The new study used data from the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was launched by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the early 1990s.",
      "At the outset, blood samples were collected from the women to measure cholesterol and hsCRP levels.",
      "Of the nearly 28,000 women who provided a baseline blood test, 12,530 had no standard modifiable risk factors for heart disease, or \u201cSMuRFs.\u201d During 30 years of follow-up, there were 973 cardiovascular events \u2014 such as a heart attack or stroke \u2014 in this group. Levels of hsCRP were significantly higher among women who experienced them.",
      "The new findings indicate that inflammation should be included in heart disease screenings, Ridker said. High inflammation can be treated with statins, but with a healthy cholesterol reading, these women would not qualify for a statin prescription.",
      "A previous clinical trial found that women who do not have the standard modifiable risk factors could benefit from treatment with statins. That trial showed that women with high inflammation but no other risk factors saw a 38% reduction in serious cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack if they received statin therapy, Ridker said.",
      "But if hsCRP isn\u2019t measured, these women won\u2019t get the lifesaving treatment they need, Ridker said. \u201cThe bottom line is that physicians will not treat what they don\u2019t measure,\u201d he said.",
      "Hausvater said that screening should be routine for all women.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool women should be offered to assess their risk,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say, based on this study, I would recommend that patients ask their physicians to check their hsCRP.\u201d",
      "Dr. Tania Ruiz, a cardiologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, agreed. \u201cThis is a very exciting study,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first large-scale study of hsCRP as a predictor of cardiovascular events in otherwise healthy women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve learned more about the role of inflammation in the formation of plaques and plaque vulnerability,\u201d Ruiz said.",
      "Women with autoimmune diseases such as lupus may be more likely to have a high hsCRP score, Ruiz said. Otherwise, without testing, there\u2019s no way to know."

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi fired a Justice Department employee  on Friday accused of flipping off National Guard members deployed to Washington D.C. as part of President Donald Trump's effort to mitigate crime in the city, a Justice Department official confirmed.",
      "According to a memo sent by Bondi, the veracity of which was confirmed by the DOJ, the employee, Elizabeth Baxter, worked as a paralegal specialist in the department's Environment and Natural Resources Division.",
      "The New York Post was first to report Baxter\u2019s termination.",
      "\u201cBased on your inappropriate conduct towards National Guard service members, your employment with the Department of Justice is hereby terminated, and you are removed from federal service effective immediately,\u201d Bondi wrote in the memo, as confirmed by the Justice Department.",
      "A Justice Department official told NBC News that Baxter was seen and heard using the vulgar gesture and shouting to Guard members on multiple occasions.",
      "The incidents allegedly occurred several times during the last two weeks, though NBC News has not independently confirmed the accusations.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department, Gates McGavick, lauded the termination on Friday, writing in a post on X, \u201cif you don\u2019t support law enforcement, [Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s] DOJ might not be a good fit.\u201d",
      "The termination marks the second time this month Bondi has terminated a Justice Department employee for conduct she's deemed inappropriate toward law enforcement personnel.",
      "Weeks ago, Bondi fired a department paralegal after he was caught on camera throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent outside of a popular nightlife area in D.C. She wrote at the time, \"you will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\"",
      "Bondi initially sought to secure felony charges against that employee, Sean Dunn, but a grand jury declined to return an indictment, a signal that local residents did not identify probable cause to back that charge. U.S. District Attorney Jeanine Pirro instead charged Dunn with misdemeanor assault.",
      "Trump has consistently touted his effort to mitigate crime in D.C., which was already declining, as incredibly successful, pointing to further decreases this month in acts like carjackings. But the effort has faced mounting criticism from Democratic lawmakers and protest from D.C. residents, many of whom have characterized Trump's operation as overblown, a scare tactic and racially motivated."

      "The febrile debate went global this week when Elon Musk, the former adviser to President Donald Trump and backer of far-right movements globally, posted a picture of the flag on X.

      "The flags were put up here last week by a five-strong group including Louis Turvey, who read about the national movement on Facebook, where he said he gets most of his news.",
      "Turvey, 33, who has Roma-Gypsy heritage and was raised in London, 30 minutes away by train, says he was in no way motivated by far-right or hostile feelings. Rather he wanted to do something positive and fly his national flag \u201clike you see on holiday in Greece or Spain,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, hipster moustache, low-buttoned shirt and a single earing, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell you know what, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",

Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",

      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",

      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",

      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future.

    "summary": "Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House committee investigating Epstein's case, also said \u201cmany of the victims\u201d will meet with lawmakers next week on Capitol Hill.",
    "story": [
      "The top Democrat on the House committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case said Friday that the estate of the convicted sex offender will turn over a book that reportedly contains an explicit 2003 birthday message from President Donald Trump to Epstein.",
      "The estate is set to include the contents of the book following a subpoena the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued this week as part of its probe, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif, said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cThe estate is actually going to actually now get us that book and a bunch of other documents that they have that\u2019s actually not been reported yet,\" he said. \"We\u2019re gonna get those documents, as we understand it now, on September the 8th. And so that will continue our investigation.\u201d",
      "Garcia also said that \u201cmany of the victims\u201d of Epstein will come to Capitol Hill next week to meet with lawmakers, which he said was to \u201chighlight their stories\u201d and \u201ccenter the victims.\u201d",
      "The subpoena to Epstein's estate, signed by Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., ordered the production of a series of documents by Sept. 8, including \u201call entries contained within the reported leather-bound book compiled by Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday.\u201d It also called for any records that \u201ccould be reasonably construed to be a potential list of clients.\u201d",
      "Reached for comment on Garcia's remarks, a spokesman for Comer told NBC News in a statement, \u201cThe Committee expects the Epstein estate to comply with the Chairman\u2019s subpoena and deliver documents and communications, including a scanned copy of the reported birthday book, in its possession to the Committee.\u201d",
      "Representatives of Epstein's estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.",
      "The Oversight committee, which has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files, ramped up its investigation after the DOJ and FBI thrust Epstein's case back into the spotlight with an unsigned joint memo saying they would not be releasing any additional files.",
      "The memo sparked an uproar among Trump's base and even within his administration. Trump on the campaign trail claimed that the government had hid aspects of its investigation into Epstein, and he pledged to further transparency.",
      "The situation escalated last month when the Wall Street Journal published a story saying Trump had sent Epstein a drawing of a naked woman as a 50th birthday message that Ghislaine Maxwell included as part of a leather-bound book with many other birthday messages from friends. Trump sued the Journal and its parent company\u2019s owner Rupert Murdoch for libel, seeking at least $10 billion in damages, and said in a social media post announcing the lawsuit that the story was \u201cFAKE NEWS.\u201d",
      "NBC News has not independently verified or seen the birthday message.",
      "The Oversight committee this week also said that former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who was U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida when that office reached a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2008, will voluntarily sit for a transcribed interview next month.",
      "The committee previously issued a batch of subpoenas for recipients such as former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former FBI Director Robert Mueller.",
      "A committee spokesperson said Friday that the panel was withdrawing its subpoena for Mueller due to \u201chealth issues that preclude him from being able to testify.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Bones were found near a Cascade Mountains campground in Washington State amid the manhunt for the 33-year-old suspected of killing his three young daughters, the FBI said on Friday.",
      "The campground near Leavenworth, Washington, is the location of the discovery of the bodies of Travis Decker\u2019s three daughters, Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5, on June 2.",
      "The bones are being analyzed to determine if they're human, FBI Seattle spokesperson Ted Halla said Friday.",
      "\"We can confirm that some bones were collected as part of the search activity earlier in the week around the Rock Island Campground,\" he said by email.",
      "Earlier this month, the office said DNA from plastic bags found on the girls heads matched that of the father, and no other human DNA besides the girls' own was found. The county medical examiner concluded the girls died by suffocation and are the victims of homicide, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Following the discovery of their bodies, local, state and federal authorities launched an extensive manhunt for Decker, fearing he could use his military background and outdoors experience to vanish.",
      "Decker\u2019s pickup was also found nearby, on land described by the Chelan County Sheriff\u2019s Office as \u201crugged and heavily forested terrain,\u201d about 150 miles east of Seattle.",
      "Decker was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping and is the subject of an arrest warrant.",
      "On May 30, his ex-wife reported Decker did not return the girls after a planned visit, authorities said. The report wasn't enough to trigger an Amber Alert, Washington State Patrol said, noting that a late return is not necessarily an abduction and that there was no imminent threat of violence.",
      "Investigators said motive was unclear. Court filings state Decker refused to sign a parenting plan nearly a year ago that included orders to seek mental health treatment and anger management counseling.",
      "On Monday, Chelan County Sheriff Michael L. Morrison outlined the two-day search for evidence near the campground on federal land that started Monday and drew roughly 100 police, deputies and federal agents.",
      "\"Over the past three months, investigative teams, led by your Sheriff\u2019s Office Investigative Unit, have pursued every lead and searched vast, remote areas in the hope of locating Travis Decker or any evidence that might bring us closer to answers,\" Morrison said in a statement.",
      "The sheriff repeated that it's not clear if Decker is alive.",
      "\"At this time, no conclusive evidence has been found to indicate whether Travis Decker is alive or deceased,\" he said. \"We continue to follow every credible lead.\""

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 22:19:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Luigi Mangione, accused of gunning down an insurance executive in New York City, has inspired others to violence, federal prosecutors say in a new court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione, who is accused of gunning down a top insurance company executive on a New York City street, has inspired others to embrace violence, including the gunman behind last month\u2019s deadly attack on the NFL headquarters in Manhattan, federal prosecutors contend in a new court filing.",
      "Mangione, the prosecutors argued in Wednesday\u2019s filing, poses a threat to the public because he is actively seeking to influence others to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cSimply put, the defendant hoped to normalize the use of violence to achieve ideological or political objectives,\u201d they said in the document. \u201cSince the murder, certain quarters of the public \u2014 who openly identify as acolytes of the defendant \u2014 have increasingly begun to view violence as an acceptable, or even necessary, substitute for reasoned political disagreement.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 27, is awaiting trial, charged in the Dec. 4, 2024, ambush killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Arrested in Pennsylvania five days after the fatal shooting, Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of murder, two counts of stalking and a firearms offense for allegedly using a silencer. He also faces state murder charges.",
      "But since his arrest, Mangione has \u201copenly cultivated supporters\u201d by setting up a website where he directly addresses them and catalogues the supportive letters he has received while locked up in the Brooklyn federal prison, the prosecutors said.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April that the government would seek the death penalty against Mangione for \u201can act of political violence\u201d and a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "The new filing by federal prosecutors is an attempt to counter a defense motion for more information on what the government intends to offer as evidence that Mangione should be put to death for a killing that has made him a folk hero to some members of the public.",
      "In May, Mangione\u2019s legal defense fund surpassed $1 million in donations from more than 28,000 people, many of whom are angry with the nation\u2019s for-profit medical system.",
      "To buttress their argument that Mangione was inspiring more mayhem, prosecutors in a footnote cited the July 28 attack on pro football\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters by a gunman named Shane Tamura, who fatally shot an off-duty New York City police officer, a Blackstone executive and two other people, before killing himself.",
      "\u201cLike Mangione, Tamura left behind a piece of evidence for investigators to find, blaming the NFL and football for causing chronic traumatic encephalopathy,\u201d the prosecutors wrote, referring to the brain disease often caused by concussions. \u201cAlmost immediately, members of the public sympathetic to the defendant touted Tamura\u2019s actions as a laudable continuation of the defendant\u2019s philosophy.\u201d",
      "Mangione laid out his plans against the \u201cdeadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\u201d in a red notebook that investigators found after his arrest, New York state prosecutors alleged in a June court filing.",
      "The lawyer who represents Mangione in the federal case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday."

    "summary": "Read on for an ending explainer for Netflix's \"Thursday Murder Club\" \u2013 including everyone who dies and who is the killer.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for the end of \"Thursday Murder Club.\"",
      "In \"Thursday Murder Club,\" a Netflix movie based on Richard Osman's novel of the same name, four residents in the Coopers Chase retirement home have a hobby of trying to solve cold cases. Then, they find themselves in the middle of an active investigation.",
      "At the start of the film, they\u2019re faced with two conundrums: A case from the 1970s in which a woman was stabbed and fell out of a window; and the fact that Ian, the man who owns the land the home is built on, is going through a nasty divorce and has to sell \u2014 no matter who he mows down in the process.",
      "The members of the Club include Helen Mirren (as Elizabeth), Pierce Brosnan (as Ron), Ben Kingsley (as Ibrahim), Celia Imrie (as Joyce) and, from her bed in a coma, Susan Kirby as Penny, the former policewoman who helped her friends (now members) get old case logs to solve.",
      "On top of that we\u2019ve got familiar, most-welcome faces in Richard E. Grant (Bobby), David Tennant (Ian), Tom Ellis (Jason), and Jonathan Pryce (Stephen), all of whom turn up playing various dubious characters.",
      "Naomi Ackie (Donna) is the policewoman who\u2019s stuck serving tea to her co-workers until the Club tricks the force into putting her on Tony\u2019s murder investigation.",
      "Beyond the central mystery, there are side stories.",
      "Elizabeth has a mysterious background (turns out she worked for MI6) and a beloved husband (Pryce) with dementia. Ron, a former union organizer, has a famous son whose star is fading. Ibrahim lives meticulously but never felt he fit in anywhere. Joyce\u2019s hard-driving hedge fund daughter who turns out to be an unexpected ally. Elizabeth makes two newfound friends in Donna and Ian\u2019s assistant Bogdan (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), one of which turns out to not be as much of a friend as she\u2019d imagined.",
      "Read on for a rundown of what happens.",
      "Who Dies and Who Are the Killers in \u2018Thursday Murder Club\u2019?",
      "The story really picks up when the murders start. Ian\u2019s partner Tony (Geoff Bell) turns up dead after an argument with Ian \u2014 he won\u2019t sell his portion of the property, since his dear aunt lives in the home. Then, Ian himself also keels over.",
      "What might surprise viewers is to find out there\u2019s a link among all of these players to the cold case the Club has been trying to solve \u2014 one that involves a long-missing third partner (and crime lord) in the home, who has full control over what happens to the home after Tony and Ian snuff it.",
      "In the end, after a lot of tea and cake, fooling the police, Club trickery and a sudden buyer who turns up to purchase the property and save it, here\u2019s whodunit for all four murders. Yep, all four.",
      "Tony is done in by Bogdan, who swears he didn\u2019t mean to do it. Bogdan is an illegal Polish worker in the UK and Tony wouldn\u2019t give him back his passport.",
      "The cold case's solution also relates to the residents of Coopers Chase.",
      "Peter, Angela\u2019s boyfriend at the time, killed his girlfriend. Early on we learn that he probably was guilty all along \u2014 but was considered \u201cone of the boys\u201d by the police at the time and allowed to disappear.",
      "Well, not all of \u201cthe boys\u201d agreed with that \u2014 Penny, who was low person at the station at the time, was sure Peter had killed Angela, and tired of seeing so many abusers get off, she killed him herself. Her husband John kept this a secret for decades.",
      "When Ian decided to start digging up the church and gravesite ahead of selling off the land (and repurposing the home as an events location), John knew he\u2019d find the bones of Mercer, which he and Penny had hidden in the graveyard.",
      "He worried his wife would be implicated after all these years, and took out Ian with a needle full of fentanyl. Once John confesses, the rest of the Club leave him for a last moment with his comatose wife, knowing he will use another fentanyl needle to let her go to a peaceful rest (because once he\u2019s jailed, he can\u2019t be there for her).",
      "Is Coopers Chase saved?",
      "It almost certainly is! Elizabeth suggests that Joyce\u2019s financially-focused daughter Joanna (Ingrid Oliver) should buy the place, an offer Joanna finds \u201cintriguing.\u201d And since Coopers Chase appears in Osman\u2019s sequels, it\u2019s safe to say this was only an attempted murder.",
      "As of now, Netflix hasn\u2019t confirmed that they plan to make movies of the rest of Osman\u2019s books, but we already know we\u2019re ready to return to the scenes of the crimes."

      "\"Are you tired of boring, watered-down brews that leave you feeling flat?\" Kelce says in the commercial while wearing a blue Garage Beer shirt reminiscent of the shirt Mays wore while pitching OxiClean. \"Sick of settling for the same old beers that just don't pack a punch?!\"",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers from \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d book and television series.",
      "You won\u2019t find a bigger fan of \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d than its creator, Rebecca Cutter. The self-professed \u201cMargo truther\u201d is basking in \u201cincredible gratitude\u201d after such massive fan reaction to the Netflix hit, which continues to be the most-watched streaming original show this month.",
      "The series, originally made for Starz before finding its home at Netflix, has been a mainstay in the streamer\u2019s Top 10 list in the U.S. since its July release. It has become the subject of multiple group chats and fan edits on social media, and a new ship has set sail as a result of the eight-episode season: Margo (Malin \u00c5kerman) and Sophie (Brittany Snow). The Instagram account for \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d even posted a callout for viewers to cast their vote for what their couple name should be.",
      "\u201cI had a lot of confidence in what the show was,\u201d Cutter tells TODAY.com, adding if Netflix could bring in the viewership, \u201cI know I can keep them watching the show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI started to let myself be hopeful,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut I still could have never predicted the wide range of people that seem to love the show. That\u2019s shocking to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives,\u201d which is an adaptation of author May Cobb\u2019s novel, follows Sophie O\u2019Neil and her husband, Graham O\u2019Neil (Evan Jonigkeit), as they move with their son from the Northeast to a small town in east Texas. She falls in with a group of Southern female socialites, which includes queen bee Margo Banks, who happens to be married to Graham\u2019s hotshot new boss, Jed Banks (Dermot Mulroney), an aspiring politician. The group\u2019s idea of a good time includes going boar hunting, a lot of drinking and for some, even hooking up with one another. It doesn\u2019t take long for Sophie to fall under Margo\u2019s spell, and the two meet up for secret romantic rendezvouses. At the same time, they\u2019re grappling with the latest drama to hit the small town: the murder of teenager Abby Jackson.",
      "In twists that deviate from the book, Margo ends up being Abby\u2019s killer \u2014 not Jill (Katie Lowes), one of the moms in the girls group whose 18-year-old son, Brad, is also secretly hooking up with Margo. And, Margo does not die in the TV adaptation, but she does at the end of the book.",
      "Cutter says she knew \u201cwell before\u201d \u00c5kerman was cast as Margo that she wanted Margo as the killer in the show.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the first things when I read the book that I knew would be one of the big changes,\u201d she explains. \u201cI knew I wanted her to do it, and I knew I wanted her to stay alive.\u201d",
      "She also crafted a grittier personal backstory for her Margo, which includes a complicated relationship with brother Kyle. Cutter says her \u201cmain intention\u201d with the changes she made was to \u201cgive everybody more sort of character work to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI also just wanted to open up a different part of Texas,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cIt is fun to watch rich people, but it\u2019s also interesting to open up a different world and to have a real divide of the classes.\u201d",
      "She adds that she loves the scene of Sophie showing up at a trailer park to visit a naked Kyle during his \u201cmeth bender.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt opens up the world and opens up plot possibilities,\u201d she says.",
      "After reading the book, Cutter traveled to Longview, Texas, about two hours east of Dallas, to do research, and not only met Cobb, but Cobb's high school best friend.",
      "\u201cWithin 10 minutes, it was totally the \u2018I love you\u2019 scene (in the show with Margo and Sophie),\u201d she says.",
      "She says they went on a three-day trip and shot guns, ate barbecue and went to honky-tonks.",
      "\u201cIt was just a blast, and we talk, like, three times a week now,\u201d Cutter says.",
      "Cobb previously told TODAY.com she feels that Cutter \u201ctook the spirit of the book, of these rowdy, sassy \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 Texas women, and just turned it up to an 11.\u201d",
      "She added that Cutter made the show \u201ceven more unapologetic and juicy and bonkers than the book.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally blowing out the different storylines and adding in some new characters and giving existing characters different backstories,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cIt's escapist fun at a time when I feel like people are really looking for that.\u201d",
      "About That Margo, Sophie, Abby Fan Theory",
      "When Margo and Sophie first meet at an NRA party at Margo and Jed's house, Sophie offers Margo a Xanax. Later on, Sophie and Margo again take Sophie's Xanax before embarking on a blackout bender the night Abby is murdered.",
      "Cutter says she didn\u2019t really think of the Xanax connection as an Easter egg but more of a plot device for the blackout and to \u201cvery specifically\u201d establish Sophie\u2019s state of mind.",
      "\u201cI try and always be as character-motivated as possible and not so much for foreshadowing, but I\u2019m glad it worked out,\u201d she says.",
      "What could possibly be foreshadowing, however, is the boar hunting outing that the wives embark on. Sophie, new to shooting, takes down a boar \u2014 but doesn\u2019t kill it. Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), who also happens to be the sheriff\u2019s wife, delivers the fatal shot to put the boar out of its misery.",
      "As the series progresses, Sophie becomes the prime suspect in Abby\u2019s murder because her gun is the one used to kill Abby, and surveillance footage in the woods shows Abby and Sophie interacting the night Abby was killed. The show actually begins with a scene of a wounded woman, who viewers later learn is Abby, running in the woods shouting for help while she's being shot at. Sophie can\u2019t remember the events of the night because she was blacked out. After various other clues arise in the case, police presume Jill is the killer, and Sophie is seemingly free.",
      "Sophie, however, pieces together that Margo is actually the killer and confronts her friend turned lover, who begs her not to tell, saying she loves her and \u201cfixed it.\u201d",
      "One fan theory states that Sophie actually fired the initial shots at Abby, but she didn\u2019t kill her \u2014 just like the boar \u2014 and Margo stepped in to deliver the kill shot to protect both Sophie and herself. Margo just never told Sophie about those initial shots, possibly to protect Sophie, who expressed guilt to Margo over a previous accident in the Northeast when she hit and killed a pedestrian while drinking and driving, according to the fan theory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great theory,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to confirm or deny because who knows what will come out in future seasons.\u201d",
      "The Margo and Sophie of It All",
      "Before Sophie, Margo was in a secret romantic relationship on the side with Callie. But once Sophie comes to town, she becomes her focus, and Margo dumps Callie.",
      "Margo tells Sophie, \u201cThere\u2019s something about me that wants to protect you,\u201d and by contrast, later says to Callie, \u201cI\u2019m Margo f------ Banks. I don\u2019t need protection.\u201d",
      "Was this moment with Sophie a genuine one for Margo, and she was actually looking out for someone who wasn\u2019t herself?",
      "\u201cI always feel like with Margo \u2014 and actually I feel this way about humans in general \u2014 this is how I like to write characters. Everything can be both things at once,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cYou can be a manipulator but also mean it. So I do think she feels that way about Sophie, and I think that\u2019s one of the beautiful things about Brittany Snow\u2019s performance, is that everyone, I think, kind of feels like, \u2018I wish I could just wrap this girl up in a blanket because she\u2019s causing herself a lot of trouble.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd I think Margo definitely feels protective of her and loving of her, and it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all out of the goodness of her heart either. She obviously had ulterior motives.\u201d",
      "Cutter adds she believes the \u201crichest characters\u201d are \u201csort of femme fatale.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fun if they\u2019re just completely calculated monsters, but it\u2019s not fun if they don\u2019t have any evil intent, either,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere should always be multiple layers going on.\u201d",
      "Cobb said the Margo-Sophie dynamic in the show is similar to the book with \u201cSophie falling under her spell.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do think Margo has feelings for her, but Margo is a more transactional person and manipulator,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she genuinely cares for Sophie, but, you know, watch out if, oh, I just can't wait. I hope there's a Season 2 so we can find out what's going to happen.\u201d (The show has not yet been officially picked up for Season 2.)",
      "There are, of course, Margo and Sophie fans who want the pairing to be the endgame, while others don\u2019t think they\u2019d make it in the long run because Margo can be so toxic and self-serving.",
      "\u201cI just love Margo even \u2014 I love her either way,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, a Margo truther. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s evil. I don\u2019t care if she was completely justified. I like her. I\u2019m going to watch her either way. I\u2019m going to sleep with her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, people want to really have it defined, and they want to have it defined by me. And I always say, like, \u2018Babe, make your own decision. I don\u2019t own the character. If you want to think that she\u2019s telling the truth, believe that. If you don\u2019t, it should work either way.\u2019\u201d",
      "(For the record, Cutter is a fan of the first wig Margo wears in the show, before going blond as Jed\u2019s campaign for governor gets underway. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that everyone hates it so much. I think she\u2019s iconic. \u2026 It looks fantastic on her and established her character.\u201d)",
      "Her Favorite Margo and Sophie Scene",
      "Cutter says the Margo and Sophie scene she loves the most is from the first episode, when Margo brings Sophie home following an intimate detour in a parking lot after a night out at the bar with the girls.",
      "\u201cI love the moment when Margo\u2019s dropping her off in that first episode, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to have so much fun together. I love you.\u2019 And Sophie goes, \u2018I love you, too.\u2019 It was exactly how I pictured it when I wrote it, which is that thing of \u2026 women do this all the time. We make fast friends, and we say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 not meaning it, exactly. \u2026 But then Sophie saying it in a different way. Obviously, she\u2019s not in love with her yet, but Brittany is putting all those levels into it where you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, does she love her love her?\u2019 She\u2019s not just saying it back in the same tone that Margo was saying it. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d",
      "Cutter says she\u2019s seen the episode \u201chundreds of times in the editing room.\u201d",
      "\u201cErwin Stoff, who\u2019s the other executive producer, every time he knew that it would make me smile,\u201d she says of the scene. \u201cSo he would always look over and wait for me to be smiling at that take.\u201d",
      "Is Sophie in Love With Margo?",
      "Snow said she played the character of Sophie like she was in love with Margo.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like to speak for our fictional characters, even though I did write them,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI certainly think she was falling in love with her.\u201d",
      "While the reveal of Margo as Abby\u2019s murderer \u201ccomplicates things,\u201d Cutter says, \u201cIt becomes a question of, like, \u2018Can you love someone knowing how deeply flawed they are?\u2019\u201d",
      "That\u2019s something that will have to be addressed in the future, as will the fallout of Sophie killing Margo\u2019s brother in the show\u2019s final moments of the first season.",
      "Will Margo ever be able to forgive Sophie? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Cutter teases.",
      "One thing that is for certain is that Sophie has \u201cbeen in denial\u201d about her sexuality. A flashback reveals Sophie and her female college roommate crossed the friendship line and spent a romantic night together.",
      "\u201cI think that was important to me to show that it wasn\u2019t just \u2014 Margo is magical, even though she is, but, like, I mean she\u2019s magical to bring her out of it, but I did want to give Sophie more of a thorough queerness \u2026 a richer sense that it isn\u2019t just, \u2018Oh, Margo\u2019s this unicorn,\u2019 but that this is something Sophie has thought and felt before and been in denial about or pushing away. And that Margo is the one that\u2019s able to make it seem like a feasible life choice.\u201d",
      "Cobb said it was \u201csuper smart\u201d for Cutter to give Sophie \u201ca more compelling background.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's falling head over heels for Margo,\u201d Cobb said of Sophie, \u201cand it's an unstoppable force.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the book, she doesn't have that backstory, and then Graham's need to sort of control her,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there's a tension there of, \u2018Wow, there's absolutely nothing wrong with my home life. Husband's great, treats me great. And yet I cannot resist the siren call of Margo Banks.\u2019\u201d",
      "The show has led many people to share their thoughts online about how the show has made them rethink sexuality.",
      "Cutter says it\u2019s \u201cso rewarding\u201d to see her work be that \u201cclosely watched and processed.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou spend all this time writing something, and you don\u2019t know \u2014 people could just be there texting or doing their laundry or yelling at their kids and barely watching it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to have people, like, making edits and really parsing out, like, \u2018What did that line mean?\u2019 or \u2018What was that look?\u2019 or \u2018Look at what her hand does there.\u2019",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like, oh my God, you feel so seen. And I\u2019m so grateful that people are feeling seen by this show. I love that it\u2019s a two-way street.\u201d"

      "Jackie has a \u201cthing\u201d with two of the Walter boys: Younger brother Alex (Ashby Gentry) and older brother Cole (Noah Lalonde). She dates Alex in Season 1 \u2014 then kisses Cole in the finale. It\u2019s enough to send her running away for the summer back to New York.",
      "Come Season 2, Jackie tells Alex that she and Cole had kissed. He's livid and confronts his brother, who tries to apologize. Alex doesn't accept the apology.",
      "But it doesn't take long for Alex to decide that he can't get over Jackie and, despite some other flirtations, they get back together. Still, Cole and Jackie share a few longing glances, indicating things aren't quite over between them.",
      "\u201cThis season, Jackie\u2019s ready to face everything a little bit more head on. Season 1, she pushes everything away and runs away from her problems. And I think Season 2, she\u2019s trying not to do that,\u201d Nikki Rodriguez, who plays Jackie, tells TODAY.com.",

      "Jackie says she \u201ccan\u2019t be\u201d with someone who makes her feel the way Cole does. It\u2019s then that Cole declares he loves Jackie. She admits she loves him too.",
      "\u201cWhy would being with me be so awful?\u201d he asks.",
      "She indicates it has something to do with her history and the trauma of losing her family. Cole makes her feel out of control _ and she can't have that.",
      "\u201cWhen we kissed, it was the only time I ever stopped thinking about everything \u2026 I felt very free, like I was out of control. And I can\u2019t have that. I can\u2019t lose control,\u201d she says.",
      "Then \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 Alex reveals that he\u2019s heard the entire conversation.",

      "Rodriguez says Jackie is afraid to make a decision. \u201cJackie ultimately doesn\u2019t want to hurt anybody, and she doesn\u2019t want to make any mistakes. She tries to be this perfect version of herself all the time,\u201d she says.",
      "Meanwhile, after a season with Jackie, Noah Lalonde says Cole has made a decision about Jackie.",
      "\u201cWhen Jackie enters Cole\u2019s life, he\u2019s in a vulnerable position. Then here comes Jackie, having just lost her family and having somehow gotten back up. She serves as an inspiration to him \u2026 and as that develops, I think he realizes that she\u2019s just the type of person you\u2019d want to spend your life with,\u201d Lalonde says.",
      "Alex, meanwhile, is experiencing deja vu \u2014\u00a0he has been in this position before. In Season 1, we learn that Cole had hooked up with a girl Alex was seeing. Cole later says he didn\u2019t know her connection to his brother.",
      "When asked for his reaction to the declaration of love, Gentry says, \u201cHe\u2019s probably thinking, \u2018Bruh, again?\u2019 I think he is just confused. So hopefully he\u2019ll get some answers.\u201d",

    "summary": "Season 3, Episode 8, of \"TSITP\" ends in heartbreak for Belly after her fianc\u00e9, Jeremiah, receives a letter from Susannah that was actually meant for his brother, Conrad.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for the most recent episode of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d Season 3 ...",
      "The most recent episode of the third and final season of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d features a shocking twist.",
      "The show's eighth episode follows its main character, Belly (Lola Tung), as she prepares to walk down the aisle and marry her childhood best friend Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno). However, a surprising revelation means the day doesn't go to plan.",
      "The couple decides not to say \"I do\" after Jeremiah accuses Belly of still being in love with his brother, Conrad (Christopher Briney).",
      "Jeremiah\u2019s change of heart is also largely due to a letter his mom, Susannah, who died several years before, wrote for him to read on his wedding day. While the letter was in an envelope addressed to Jeremiah, it is revealed during the episode that Susannah accidentally switched the letters. (Eagle-eyed viewers have spotted a moment from Season 2 in which a very sick Susannah, played by Rachel Blanchard, drops the letters she was writing, and Laurel, played by Jackie Chung, helps hastily stuff them back into their envelopes.)",
      "So the letter Jeremiah reads in the episode was actually meant for Conrad.",
      "While only visible for a couple of seconds on screen, the letter is integral in Jeremiah\u2019s decision to break off the engagement. So, what does Susannah's message say? And why does he decide not to marry Belly?",
      "What Does Susannah\u2019s Letter Say to Conrad?",
      "The letter was not read aloud during the episode, but the handwritten note is shown in full for a few seconds on screen. While some viewers paused the show to read its contents, the show\u2019s creator Jenny Han acknowledged on Instagram, \"I know some of y\u2019all can\u2019t read cursive.\"",
      "Han shared the letter\u2019s full text on Instagram Aug. 28, the day after the episode\u2019s release.",
      "Dear Conrad,",
      "I can hardly believe my little bug is getting married today! I am just bursting at the thought that my beautiful boy has found the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with.",
      "I only ever got to see you in love once, and for that I will always, always be grateful. Not just that I got to see you in love but I got to see you be loved. Oh, the way she looked at you \u2014 it was like you were the only boy in the world. As a mother, there is no greater gift than to see her child be so dearly loved by another person. Today, if there is even a fraction of the love I saw then, I am more than happy. I am overjoyed.",
      "Don\u2019t be afraid to tell her every day how very much she means to you. Cook for her, be a good listener, don\u2019t try to win every argument. Jewelry is always welcome. Pay attention to if she wears gold or silver. If she\u2019s not a jewelry girl, then chocolate.",
      "Loving you always and forever,",
      "Mom",
      "What Happens with Susannah's Letter in the Books?",
      "In the books the show is based on, also written by Han, Susannah\u2019s full letter to Conrad is never revealed.",
      "However, the scene in the show where Jeremiah reads the letter is   similar to the book. Like in the show, Conrad brings the letter to Jeremiah after he disappears on the morning of the wedding day.",
      "\u201cSwallowing, he tore the envelope open,\u201d Conrad narrates in the trilogy's third book, \"We'll Always Have Summer.\" \u201cI watched him as he read, hoping, knowing, my mom would have the right words. She always knew what to say to Jeremiah. Jere started to cry as he read, and I turned my head away.\u201d",
      "After reading the letter, Jeremiah reveals that the letter was meant for Conrad. Upset by its contents, Jeremiah tells Conrad that he is not his brother anymore and leaves. Conrad then opens the letter and sees the \u201cDear Conrad\u201d at the top. He starts to cry, and the chapter ends.",
      "Later in the book, when Jeremiah ends the engagement with Belly, he tells her what the letter said.",
      "\u201cMy mom must have mixed up the envelopes,\u201d Jeremiah tells Belly. \u201cIn the letter she said \u2014 she said she only ever got to see him in love once. That was with you.\u201d",
      "Jeremiah decides not to get married because he doesn\u2019t want to hold Belly back from Conrad, saying that she will never move on if he does.",
      "The book ends after that reveal, followed by a three-page epilogue.",
      "But the final scene of Episode 8 ends on a different note than its source material. After calling off the wedding, Belly heads to an airport and buys a ticket to Paris. While in line to board the plane, as Taylor Swift's \"Cardigan\" plays in the background, she sees Conrad. The screen fades to black and the credits roll before Conrad spots Belly, leaving fans on a slight cliffhanger before Episode 9 drops Sept. 3.",
      "With three episodes left to go, fans wonder how the remainder of the season will diverge from the books.",
      "\"we are in uncharted territory. 3 episodes to go and very very little book left,\" one viewer said on X. \"we should all be terrified.\""

      "\u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s engagement ring is seriously gorgeous and one of a kind,\u201d Megan Kothari, founder of fine jewelry brand AARYAH, tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt is probably a natural, elongated antique cushion-cut diamond of around eight to 10 carats.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere are very few diamonds with this age, shape and cut on the worldwide market,\u201d Harris adds. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a unique stone, and that\u2019s definitely worth something.\u201d",

      "It was in Cauca last year in the town of El Plateado that a 10-year-old boy was killed by a grenade dropped from a drone onto a field during a soccer game. The boy, identified as \u201cDylan\u201d by Brig. Gen. Federico Mej\u00eda, commander of the armed forces in Cauca, was the first death from a drone strike in the country. Twelve others were injured in the explosion.",
      "The rate of strikes has rapidly accelerated since. \u201cEvery day they try and attack,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "In 2024, the Colombian Defense Ministry recorded 119 drone-related attacks. In 2025, attacks have doubled, with 180 incidents documented as of August.",
      "The sound of fear",
      "The drones \u2014 cheap, easy to operate and widely available online \u2014 are altered to carry explosives filled with nails, pieces of chainsaws and metal bolts, Mej\u00eda said. Used for surveillance and strikes, they can fly more than 1,000 feet above, making them virtually imperceptible to people on the ground.",
      "\u201cThe human ear can\u2019t hear it,\u201d said Secretary Luis Fernando Ni\u00f1o Lopez, high commissioner for peace in Norte de Santander, a region that encompasses Catatumbo. Drones, he said, have allowed militant groups to go beyond traditional battlefields and reach civilians.",
      "\u201cBefore, the war was body to body,\u201d Ni\u00f1o Lopez said. \u201cHowever, this changed to personal attacks, looking from house to house and using drones.\u201d",
      "In other instances, surveillance and intimidation go hand in hand. \u201cThe word is \u2018zumbido\u2019 (\u2018buzz\u2019),\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch. In interviews the organization conducted with Indigenous communities in Catatumbo, residents described the \u201chumming sound\u201d from drones monitoring the population.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge fear created now in Catatumbo whenever there\u2019s the sound of a drone going around,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2018We can do that\u2019",
      "The adoption of drones marks the latest evolution in a conflict that has raged for over half a century in Colombia, experts said. In 2016, the government reached a peace agreement with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, FARC. The agreement was criticized from many sides, including some FARC militants who refused to disarm and continued operating in smaller numbers.",
      "With the reduction in their ranks, militant groups \u2014 no strangers to asymmetrical warfare \u2014 changed tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of a sort of criminal learning,\u201d Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cThey see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, the extremely broad use of drones. They think, \u2018Hey, we can do that.\u2019 Then one group starts in Colombia, and it spreads like wildfire.\u201d",
      "Over the past few years, videos emerged on social media of militants experimenting with store-bought drones. A video from 2023 shows fighters from a FARC dissident group testing the weight of a grenade tied to the body of a drone with a piece of string.",
      "\u201cOften, these munitions are very rudimentary,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cThe majority of attacks have been aimed at police or military targets or rival armed groups, but often they are exploding, obviously, in areas that affect civilians, because they are, by definition, an indiscriminate weapon.\u201d",
      "\u2018Drone comes, drone goes\u2019",
      "Civilians, especially children, in Cauca and Catatumbo have ended up on both ends of drone attacks. Last August, authorities arrested a 16-year-old who they said had operated a drone that dropped a bomb on a police building.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of the guys who put together these drones, who run them being 16, 17, 18 years old,\u201d Dickinson said. Child recruitment in Colombia has soared in the past several years, she said, increasing over 1,000% between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Commercial drones are relatively simple to operate, and children, already predisposed to mastering new technology, are ideal targets for recruitment. \u201cMy son is 13 and manages a drone perfectly,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "Children in Colombia are increasingly vulnerable to the lures of militant groups, who have used social media apps like TikTok and WhatsApp to promote a glamorized version of the guerrilla lifestyle, according to experts, who also point to the absence of schoolteachers, many of whom have fled the violence in the region, as a contributing factor.",
      "A cycle of attacks, forced recruitment and instability has brought about Colombia\u2019s largest displacement from one region in at least 28 years. More than 73,000 people have fled Norte de Santander, according to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office of Colombia.",
      "For half a year, Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Abril, 55, known to his friends and family as Carmito, has been running for his life. The farmer and social leader from Catatumbo told NBC News he\u2019s a target of the ELN. In January, he was rescued by military police along with 19 other farmers after the rebel group launched several attacks against rival FARC dissidents. Speaking to Colombian media weeks after he was rescued, he said he was targeted due to his past in farmworker struggles and his previous support for the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, a party linked with FARC.",
      "Now in hiding, Abril hears updates from his siblings and nephews who remain in Catatumbo.",
      "Drones, which at one time promised to be a technological advancement for farmers in Colombia, have become a symbol of terror.",
      "\u201cCatatumbo is becoming drone comes, drone goes,\u201d Abril said. \u201cThere is a fear of drones since farmers are military targets for the ELN.\u201d",
      "Amid the exchange of attacks from the ELN and FARC dissidents in the region, drones have dropped explosives on the homes of people in the countryside. In May, a 12-year-old and his mother were killed in Tib\u00fa when a drone dropped a grenade on their house, Abril said.",
      "\u2018A major risk for the future\u2019",
      "The military and government of Colombia have recently taken measures to stem the surge of drone attacks. The Defense Ministry has proposed a series of bills that would create a national registry for drones and classify strikes on civilians as terrorism.",
      "Soldiers have also started using anti-drone technology, devices that can locate unmanned aircraft and jam their signals. Since implementing these defenses, Mej\u00eda said, his forces have reduced the number of these attacks by 80% in Cauca.",
      "Devices for countering drones are by no means ubiquitous. Soldiers and police often try to shoot drones out of the sky, a relatively ineffective measure that creates its own public safety risks when they are shot down above crowded areas.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very hard to shoot down,\u201d said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf you\u2019re a civilian living in rural Colombia, and there is a drone that can drop bombs from hundreds of feet above you or can fly in and detonate the explosive, you really have virtually no recourse.\u201d",
      "The country is facing another challenge to its ability to fight the rapidly evolving strategies and equipment of militant forces. At risk are hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid tied up in a certification process of the country\u2019s commitment to the war on drugs.",
      "Colombia has narrowly avoided decertification in past years, but it has failed to cut the illegal growth of coca crops, which has risen each year in the past decade, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "By Sept. 15, President Donald Trump will decide whether to cut off aid to Colombia. Cutting off the supply of resources and technologies to the country could cripple its efforts to fight militants in the future, said Alberto Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Ferrero, a former general for Colombia\u2019s armed forces. He added that it would be \u201cvery bad for our strategy, for approach, and especially for the very, very strong relationship that the military forces of Colombia and our national police had with the U.S. for decades.\u201d",
      "The adoption of drone warfare by militant groups in Latin America is not unique to Colombia. Already, Mexican cartels have used drones to attack police and one another. In Ecuador, a drone targeted the roof of a high-security prison to force a jailbreak.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a major risk for the future,\u201d Ziemer said. \u201cI think the region as a whole has yet to come to terms with the scale and potential scale of the threat we\u2019re seeing.\u201d"

      "\u201cAnd I hope that\u2019s paid off in spades, because we love this community,\u201d he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency\u2019s price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November.",
      "Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees \u2014 some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols \u2014 cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father\u2019s predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, \u201cThis is the time to buy.\u201d",
      "The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office.",
      "Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.",

      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department\u2019s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a \u201ccrypto czar\u201d and held a White House summit for industry leaders.

      "Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam,\u201d has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.",
      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age, including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by the long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage, the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but the timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then age 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram were the choices of Sylvia Foulkes, then age 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff members either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2-inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Minogue, the Australian singer then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits, as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: They surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the United States only in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark it, she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: A former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise money for big projects, and the 300 million-pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "STEVENAGE, England \u2014 A tide of red and white is rising across England \u2014 hoisted on lampposts, daubed on crosswalks, stuck on apartment windows.",
      "Those behind it insist this campaign to raise the English flag, known as St. George\u2019s Cross, is an expression of patriotism; others see the sudden prevalence of the banner, sometimes associated with soccer hooliganism and racism, as a hostile statement of surging far-right sentiment.",
      "The febrile debate went global this week when Elon Musk, the former adviser to President Donald Trump and backer of far-right movements globally, posted a picture of the flag on X. Vice President JD Vance also staged his latest intervention into British life, urging people to \u201cpush back against the crazies\u201d who criticize flying the flag.",
      "'Operation Raise the Colours'",
      "In a country where the national flag is rare outside of sporting events, the banners now fluttering above a highway here in Stevenage are typical of those popping up nationwide in recent weeks as part of the grassroots \u201cOperation Raise the Colours.\u201d",
      "The flags were put up here last week by a five-strong group including Louis Turvey, who read about the national movement on Facebook, where he said he gets most of his news.",
      "Turvey, 33, who has Roma-Gypsy heritage and was raised in London, 30 minutes away by train, says he was in no way motivated by far-right or hostile feelings. Rather he wanted to do something positive and fly his national flag \u201clike you see on holiday in Greece or Spain,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, hipster moustache, low-buttoned shirt and a single earing, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell you know what, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",
      "He met his fellow flaggers through his online handle \"Stevenage Patriots\" and had never met them before, he said. \u201cI\u2019m gay and a lot of my friends are girls, so I was quite nervous hanging around with four straight lads,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it was such a lovely evening, quite spiritual actually, quite calming.\u201d",
      "However he soon experienced just how charged this debate has become when, just as his group was packing up, someone threw two Molotov cocktails at them, the second cutting Turvey\u2019s head and covering his face with blood. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he said, visibly shaken by an incident he says has put a pause on his flag-hoisting activities for the time being at least.",
      "Critics see darker forces undergirding the broader flag campaign.",
      "They view this groundswell as little more than an aggressive, provocative message to people with an immigrant background and nonwhite residents.",
      "The anti-racist campaign group Hope Not Hate reported that the founders of Operation Raise the Colours include \u201cwell-known far-right extremists\u201d and allies of Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who has become a leading nationalist voice in Britain. Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",
      "These fears are widespread. When a St. George\u2019s Cross was painted on the wall of St. John the Baptist church, in the town of Lincoln, the vicar, Rachel Heskins, saw it as a clear \u201cattempt to intimidate\u201d the diverse local community.",
      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",
      "National identity in Britain is doubly complicated because the United Kingdom includes the nations of England, Wales and Scotland, and the province of Northern Ireland. During the soccer World Cup and on some public holidays, England\u2019s banner is widely used by people of all political and demographic stripes, but outside of those events it has been co-opted by nationalists, the far-right and even fascists.",
      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",
      "That\u2019s certainly the experience of Moj, 44, a Briton with Bangladeshi heritage, sitting with his 11-year-old daughter in Stevenage\u2019s faded postwar town square.",
      "\u201cI remember being a kid and getting called all sorts of racist names. I don\u2019t get that anymore,\u201d said Moj, who like many in this town of 80,000 declined to give his second name for fear of local backlash.",
      "Despite the improvement, the flag still holds negative connotations for him. \u201dIn certain areas, if I see an English flag, there is always a part of me that thinks, OK, I've got to be a bit careful here,\u201d he said.",
      "Stevenage was dreamed up in 1946 as an example of \u201cnew town\u201d modernism, an integrated residential-commercial space in which to house families scattered by war. Today \u2014 despite a much needed \u00a31 billion ($1.35 billion) regeneration scheme on the way \u2014 its faded pebbledash and dated glass shopfronts feel like a cipher for modern Britain.",
      "As is the case across the West, many Britons are increasingly concerned and angry about rising prices, decrepit public services, a lack of housing \u2014 and the perception that immigration has been mismanaged.",
      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future. Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",
      "At first, he thought the blood running down his face was acid (acid attacks are on the rise in the U.K.), and he said the incident has only added to the chronic anxiety stemming from a homophobic attack in 2018.",
      "Though he decries any form of racism or negativity associated with the flag movement, he says that part of his motivation stemmed from the perception that the current Labour government \u201cis not siding with English people\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s probably why people are so upset at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% of the vote in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that, although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population . At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",
      "And so, amid all this, up goes the English flag.",
      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katawala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"

      "Initially, Monday\u2019s pair of deadly Israeli strikes appeared to be a \u201cdouble tap\u201d attack, in which the same target was hit twice in quick succession. The tactic, military analysts say, is to wait for first responders to race to the scene of the first attack before striking again.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement on X that an initial inquiry found that troops had identified a camera at the hospital that was being used to observe its troops \u201cin order to direct terrorist activities against them.\u201d It added that \u201ctroops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\u201d",

      "But according to five journalists on the ground there was only one camera on the hospital\u2019s roof. The Reuters news agency said it had been running a live feed from the site for the last 18 months. A senior Hamas official claimed it did not have a camera in the area.",
      "\"Israel was fully aware that Reuters and multiple other news organizations were operating from Nasser hospital, which has been one of the nerve centers for coverage out of Gaza,\" a Reuters spokesperson said in a statement. \"Reuters has frequently broadcast a feed from Nasser hospital during the war, and for the past several weeks had been delivering daily feeds from the hospital position that was hit.\"",

Even the Israeli army, by their own drones or by their own cameras, they can see Hussam and other journalists working from the fourth floor. So it\u2019s not a secret,\u201d he said, referring to Hussam al-Masri, a Reuters contractor cameraman killed in the attack.",

      "Among the dead were Mariam Dagga, 33, a visual journalist, who freelanced for The Associated Press and other news outlets during the war. Al Jazeera confirmed that one of its journalists, Mohammed Salama, was also among the dead, while Reuters reported that Moaz Abu Taha, a freelancer who worked occasionally for the organization, died in the Israeli bombing along with al-Masri. Ahmad Abu Aziz, who Middle East Eye said worked as a freelancer, was also killed.",

      "\u201cThese were extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression orchestrated by a foreign nation on Australian soil,\u201d Albanese told reporters, adding that it was considered likely that Iran had directed other attacks as well.",

      "The development \u201cpractically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people\u2019s hold on the heart of the Land of Israel,\u201d Bezalel Smotrich, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, told a news conference when he announced his approval of the plans.",
      "\u201cNow they declare it clearly and they don\u2019t need to hide it,\u201d said Shawan Jabarin, the general director of Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights organization based in the West Bank. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need philosophers and intellectuals to analyze. They speak about it themselves: \u2018This is to kill any possibility of a Palestinian state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since the plan was tabled in the early 1990s, Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers like Smotrich have expounded upon the practical needs for new development as Jerusalem has become too crowded and environmental regulations have forbidden new building in the west of the city, which mostly belongs to Israel.",
      "But Palestinians say the area, which straddles the enormous Maale Adumim Jewish settlement and the Palestinian-majority east Jerusalem, is the only undeveloped land that might host government buildings for a new state.",
      "The construction would also split the West Bank in two, again fracturing an incipient Palestinian state already divided between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where almost 63,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign after the Hamas-led terror attacks that day, which killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 taken hostage.",
      "After almost 23 months of war, the country has faced mounting criticism about its conduct from traditional Western allies like the U.K., France and Canada, which have recently made conditional offers to recognize a Palestinian state, unless Israel revives talks to achieve that and agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Those countries were among 21 that criticized the E1 development plans as a \u201cviolation of international law\u201d in a statement Friday. \u201cWe condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,\u201d it read. British Foreign Minister David Lammy also called Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., to raise his objections.",
      "But the recognition of a Palestinian state is seen by some Israeli politicians as rewarding Hamas, leading them to view the E1 proposals as a deliberate broadside against longtime allies whose statements are increasingly drifting away from their country.",
      "\u201cIn the eyes of the right wing of Israeli politics, this is diplomatic pushback,\u201d said David Weinberg, a fellow at the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s diplomatic pushback that\u2019s already on top of what have long been salient reasons, good reasons, for Israel wanting to build on E1.\u201d",
      "But for the Israeli right, the resounding triumph of President Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House has drowned out such protests.",
      "\u201cThe E1 plan was initiated three decades ago and it was always blocked due to American pressure,\u201d said Lior Amihai, the executive director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy organization. \u201cNow under Trump, they\u2019re approving it. So certainly the lack of American resistance \u2026 enabled the Israeli government to approve it.\u201d",
      "The White House did not return a request for comment from NBC News about the E1 development.",
      "Upon retaking office, Trump lifted Biden-era sanctions on Israeli settlers who had been implicated in repeated violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "In his first term, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognized all of the city as Israel\u2019s capital. Most countries consider east Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognize Israeli sovereignty. Israel, which captured east Jerusalem, including the Old City, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, deems it as its eternal, indivisible capital.",
      "So far this year, Israel has approved 25,000 settlement housing units in the West Bank, Amihai said, far surpassing the record of 12,000 units during the whole of 2020 \u2014 a massive increase Amihai credited in part to Trump because his administration had created \u201can environment where it\u2019s easier for this government,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t have to hide anything, they can say it vocally out loud.\u201d",
      "The additional units will accommodate the burgeoning growth of the 700,000 settlers the United Nations estimates already live in the West Bank in settlements widely considered illegal under international law.",
      "Even as the E1 plan slogged through decades of bureaucratic and diplomatic obstacles, Israeli officials prepared the land some of their countrymen refer to as Judea and Samaria, using the biblical term, with a clear intention to develop it.",
      "The Samaria and Judea Police District headquarters relocated there in 2008. Highways and other roadworks connecting Jerusalem and Maale Adumim\u2019s infrastructure to the same largely uninhabited land have also been installed.",
      "Once housing there is finished, Palestinian observers say the area will become closed to their community. Even those simply driving through from the Palestinian provisional capital of Ramallah to the southern West Bank town of Bethlehem will probably have to seek longer routes, they say.",
      "Such detours shouldn\u2019t preclude further agreements between Palestinians and Israelis, Weinberg said, even as he dismissed the notion of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.",
      "\u201cInstead of battering Israel, the West should be advancing realistic space-saving arrangements for Judea and Sumeria,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael\u2019s need to build on E1 does not need to be a bar to an agreement with a serious Palestinian government.\u201d",
      "Yet the Israeli right wing has made its intentions known, Jabarin said. Such a sudden, strenuous assault on Palestinian statehood \u2014 particularly with American blessings \u2014 will require more than diplomatic rhetoric to reverse.",
      "\u201cWording there, condemnations here \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not push Israel back in any way.\u201d"

      "The first human case of the flesh-eating parasite \"New World screwworm \"has been detected in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services said early Monday.",
      "The case, involving a person who had recently traveled to El Salvador, was confirmed to be screwworm by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Health Department on Aug. 4.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said in a statement Monday that the resident has recovered \"from the infection, and the investigation confirmed there is no indication of transmission to any other individuals or animals.\"",
      "\"This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,\" HHS spokesperson Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement.",
      "\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" he said.",
      "The parasite \u2014 the larva of the New World screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and the 1990s in Central America, and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "It includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",
      "A report from the Agriculture Department last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion in livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

    "summary": "South Korea\u2019s new president, Lee Jae-myung, hopes his country\u2019s shipbuilding expertise can help revitalize the industry and stave off further Trump tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 One of the United States\u2019 strongest allies in Asia, South Korea, has had a rough start with President Donald Trump \u2014 struggling in tariff talks as it spent months without a permanent leader.",
      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, met with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to him: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes building U.S. shipyards, training shipbuilding personnel and maintaining U.S. Navy ships.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security were high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which came amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said before the meeting that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee and that they would \u201cdiscuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more.\u201d",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day\u2019s meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained that he had \u201cheard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\u201d",
      "After decades of industry decline, the United States now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the United States back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the United States, said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she said in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump have much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the United States.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "Trickier are questions about South Korea\u2019s long-standing security alliance with the United States and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could expose it more to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the United States and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before he headed to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since he was elected president in June.",
      "\u201cThat was a very deliberate and strategic move,\u201d Jo said, as the two U.S. allies seek leverage to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s vicissitudes.",
      "On his flight from Tokyo to Washington on Sunday, Lee told reporters that he had asked Ishiba for details about Japan\u2019s negotiations with the United States and that Ishiba had given \u201ca lot of very friendly advice.\u201d",
      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the United States against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The United States and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",
      "If he \u201cfails to deliver as President Trump sees fit,\u201d Trump may protest by skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting South Korea is hosting this fall.",
      "\u201cMASGA cannot cover everything for President Lee in dealing with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Stella Kim from Los Angeles."
