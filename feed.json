      "LONDON -- Bon Jovi will embark on their first tour in four years in 2026 \u2014 and it's more than just a victory lap.",
      "In 2022, singer Jon Bon Jovi saw a doctor who said one of his vocal cords was atrophying. He had major surgery and has been in extensive rehab since. These new shows \u2014 kicking off with four nights at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in July before heading to Edinburgh, Scotland; Dublin and London \u2014 are the result of all the work.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press at Wembley Stadium, where Bon Jovi will close their \u201cForever\u201d Tour in September 2026, frontman Jon Bon Jovi discusses the forthcoming gigs, his band and their latest collaborative album, \u201cForever (Legendary Edition).\u201d",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "BON JOVI: It\u2019s a lot of hits that you know. But I think more than ever, I\u2019m really in touch with the idea of gratitude and joy, and this idea of this energy that happens between me and that audience. And it\u2019s been so long since I've done it that I can really re-appreciate how much that means to me. And that\u2019s really the only motivation for me to want to do it anymore. It\u2019s just to go out there and say, \u201cTouch.\u201d You know? It\u2019s gonna be good.",
      "BON JOVI: I agree with you. I agree. You know, that optimism and tribalism but with joy as the underlying thing, you know, that fact that brings you together.",
      "BON JOVI: Well, it\u2019s home. I get to sleep in my own bed at night, which was integral to this equation, that I would play a bunch of nights there to start it as long as I was going home at night. And then we\u2019ll go and do these ( U.K. and Ireland shows) and that\u2019s going to be it. That\u2019s it for the year. Just get my feet back in the pool, you know, and get in there slowly, wait around, and after I have that joy and good health then we could talk about doing some work. But this should be about, don\u2019t even bring a suitcase. We\u2019re just going out for the weekend.",
      "BON JOVI: Really, really good. I could go tonight. I can tell that I woke up this morning at 7 a.m. and you\u2019re ready to talk and you go, \u201cYeah, it just works.\u201d",

And from the newest member, Everett Bradley to Phil X, who\u2019s just that guy that wants to play seven nights a week, doesn\u2019t care where he plays, the guy\u2019s nuts. He truly would play seven days a week if he could. And to see him just going, \u201cI\u2019m here, I am here, I\u2019m not going anywhere else,\u201d it\u2019s unbelievable.",
      "BON JOVI: Well, the thing about the \u201cForever\u201d album is that we were very proud of it, and it was coinciding with the documentary and the 40th anniversary. When I wasn\u2019t up to it physically, I thought we could reimagine the record by having features on it. In this day and age, people know what features are. I learned about that the hard way. But in doing so, I think they took a great record and made it better. And, you know, I called Robbie Williams. He was the first call I made. He said yes, which made it easier for me to call number two, three, four, seven, eight, nine, 10. Because at first, it\u2019s daunting. You call even your dear friends and go, \u201cHey, would you do this for me?\u201d Each one of them did it. I think that joy in the record is felt and even just raised the level of the bar.",
      "BON JOVI: Oh, it\u2019s fantastic. I mean, I\u2019ve looked up to him my whole life. The E Street Band are our Beatles. They were just 25 miles away from where I was as a kid. You know, Highway 9 was out my window. You know, these are, these are my streets, too. And so, it was fabulous because he loved that song (\u201cHollow Man.\u201d) Even when it was a demo, he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s a really special song.\u201d So, when I called him on that one instead of the obvious single, he was like, \u201cYou know, yeah, I get it, I can do that.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Samara Joy\u2019s voice has the ability to transform listeners to the early jazz clubs, filling them with warm nostalgia for legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "At 25, Joy is a five-time Grammy winning recording artist, whose album, \u201cLinger Awhile\u201d won her best new artist and best jazz vocal album in 2023. She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all. This is just the beginning \u2026 this is just a springboard for all of the other creative ideas that I have and what I feel like I have to offer.\u201d",
      "For Joy, releasing \u201cPortrait\u201d was a creative challenge and a turning point toward trusting her creative instincts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about what I can do and to stand firm in the creative vision and the direction that I see for myself,\u201d she said.",

      "This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "JOY: This album was a turning point. Because I feel like it was the first time I really had to make a decision about what my path was going to be. With the first two albums, it was just songs that I loved and felt like I could interpret as my own. And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs. And honestly kind of opened up even more to my band mates and said, arrange. I want you guys to orchestrate this next era.",

And I think this album taught me the importance of patience and not rushing to stay relevant or spark up a moment or just stay in that moment. It taught me to just take my time and really wait until you have something you feel like you have to say.",
      "JOY: I never expected to be nominated. I never thought that that was a possibility, at least so early on in my career.",

I\u2019m really thankful to everybody who believed in me enough to allow me to have that moment, who voted, who listened to my music, who support me then and still support me now. Which is why I never want to lose sight of what I do this for.",
      "JOY: A couple years ago I did the Hollywood Bowl and it was a birthday celebration for Quincy Jones \u2014 Patty Austin, I got the chance to sing alongside of her. And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical. Jeremy Fewell, the superintendent, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for us to know that these kids who put in hundreds of hours of hard work had that torn away from them because of the objections of a single parent,\u201d says Picoult.",

      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",
      "\u201cBetween the Lines\u201d centers on Delilah, an outsider in a new high school, who finds solace in a book and realizes she has the power to write her own story and narrate her own life. \u201cIt is a very benign message. And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",

The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The union representing Broadway's musicians reached a tentative labor agreement with commercial producers on Thursday, averting a potentially crippling strike that would have silenced nearly two dozen musicals.",
      "The American Federation of Musicians Local 802 \u2014 which represents 1,200 musicians \u2014 had threatened to strike if they didn\u2019t have a new contract by the morning, after going into mediation Wednesday.",
      "Early Thursday, the union said it had struck a tentative deal that includes wage increases and contribution increases to the health fund.",
      "\"This three-year agreement provides meaningful wage and health benefit increases that will preserve crucial access to healthcare for our musicians while maintaining the strong contract protections that empower musicians to build a steady career on Broadway,\u201d AFM Local 802 President Bob Suttmann said in a statement.",
      "The 23 shows that could have gone silent ranged from megahits like \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d to newcomers like \u201cQueen of Versailles\u201d and \u201cChess,\u201d which are still in previews. Plays would not have been automatically impacted.",
      "It was the second Broadway labor deal in less than a week. Labor tensions had already seemed cool after Actors\u2019 Equity Association \u2014 which represents over 51,000 members, including singers, actors, dancers and stage managers \u2014 announced a new three-year agreement with producers over the weekend.",

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

It\u2019s a conversation, laced with contemporary divides, that is comical for its impossibility. One is addled by paranoia and extremism, the other knows only heartless corporate speak. Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d). But, otherwise, \u201cBugonia\u201d has the feel of a quick follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d a black-comedy triptych also led by Stone and Plemons.",
      "Yet what could easily be mistaken for a tossed-off, in-between movie \u2014 there are only a handful of characters and a few scene locations \u2014 ends up feeling like a culmination-slash-nadir for Lanthimos. Having made a dozen films darkly satirizing the sad, primal folly of humankind, it\u2019s comeuppance time in \u201cBugonia.\u201d",
      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",
      "\u201cBugonia,\u201d a Focus Features release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 118 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny\u2019s music, along with backlash.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s carefully thought through,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever selected an artist where we didn\u2019t have some blowback or criticism. It\u2019s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to be a great show,\u201d Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \u201cHe understands the platform that he\u2019s on, and I think it\u2019s going to be exciting and a united moment.\u201d",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \u201cnever heard of\u201d Bad Bunny.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Trump said. \"I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we try to achieve. It\u2019s an important stage for us. It\u2019s an important element to the entertainment value.\"",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if something does evolve. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re really focused on during the season.\u201d",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get more fouls. You\u2019re going to get different sets of fouls. You\u2019re going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\u201d",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I\u2019m certain that the players will raise, and that\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s what collective bargaining is all about. They\u2019re going to need time to make sure that they\u2019re prepared, that they\u2019re ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\u201d",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and \u201829 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

      "Allen told reporters that Copeland had \"helped to redefine the face of ballet. She\u2019s inspired millions of people around the world and hopefully, American Ballet Theatre will not wait another 50 years before they have another beautiful Black principal dancer.\u201d",

      "For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late \u2014 at 13 \u2014 but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",
      "In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference \u2014 a testament to her celebrity.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation \u2026 can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\u201d",

      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "Being pregnant changes many of the processes that allow the body to stay cool during extreme heat",
      "Doctors have long known that heat puts a strain on the heart, kidneys and other organs. Those risks are exacerbated for pregnant people, as the body's processes for staying cool are altered.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening. Intensifying extreme heat events, high temperatures well into the night and shattering weather records means more exposure for pregnant people, particularly in developing countries.",
      "Here's what to know about the science of pregnancy and extreme heat:",
      "Pregnancy changes the body in myriad ways, which can make it more difficult and uncomfortable to dissipate heat.",
      "\u201cAn obvious thing is, pregnant people have a belly bump, depending how far along they are, and that\u2019s a change in their surface to volume ratio,\u201d said Anna Bershteyn, an associate professor at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and director of Project HEATWAVE, an initiative aimed at improving research on preventing extreme heat deaths. Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",
      "For pregnant people handling potent substances like pesticides, increased blood flow can also increase chemical absorption, said Dr. Chris Holstege, chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.",
      "Research is beginning to show exposure to extreme heat even in the months before getting pregnant may affect a future pregnancy, said Cara Schulte, a researcher with the University of California Berkeley and the nonprofit Climate Rights International studying maternal health and heat.",
      "During pregnancy, even short-term exposure to heat can increase the risk of severe maternal health complications, such as high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, according to the EPA. That includes preeclampsia, a condition that can be fatal for both mother and child.",
      "Heat can also worsen anxiety, depression and feelings of isolation and once the baby is born, \u201call of those things are compounded by this difficulty that postpartum women have in caring for their children in the heat,\u201d Schulte said.",

      "New Zealand is being battered by dangerous winds for the second time in a week, causing chaos across the country",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Swathes of New Zealand were pummeled by dangerous winds for the second time in a week on Thursday, with howling gales canceling hundreds of flights, causing electricity blackouts and forcing school closures.",
      "The gales were worst in the lower North Island, where the capital Wellington is located, and in parts of the South Island, including the city of Christchurch. The national forecaster MetService issued rare \"red\" wind warnings, the highest level of alert, for several regions.",
      "No deaths or serious injuries were reported. When a different weather system battered the country on Monday, a Wellington man was struck and killed by a falling tree branch.",
      "The havoc on Thursday also disrupted planned rallies for health and education workers in what was likely the country's biggest industrial walkout in decades. More than 100,000 workers represented by four unions walked off the job for four hours, after months of talks with the government about pay and conditions broke down.",
      "More than 200 flights across New Zealand were canceled on Thursday as some urban parts of New Zealand experienced wind speeds of 140 to 160 km (87 to 100 miles) per hour, with gusts in one remote, rural part of the South Island registering 230 km (143 miles) per hour.",
      "Tens of thousands of properties were without power in different parts of the country. The winds downed trees, ripped off roofs, and in the city of Dunedin, toppled shipping containers at the port.",
      "Dangerous winds also forced the closure of some highways. The remote West Coast of the South Island was cut off by road after flooding closed the only routes to the area.",
      "Some rallies by teachers, doctors and nurses around the country whose unions had planned a coordinated strike Thursday were canceled due to the weather. Union leaders said workers were still on strike, even where demonstrations were canceled.",
      "Thousands still marched in the cities of Auckland and Hamilton, and hundreds of people turned out for demonstrations in small towns unaffected by the bad weather.",

      "Hospitals and emergency rooms remained open to the public, but the government health agency urged people not to seek medical attention unless the matter was urgent. Medical staff at one hospital in the city of Nelson returned to work during the strike when the facility lost electricity in high winds.",
      "In the days before the strike, ministers in New Zealand's center-right government \u2014 often at odds with workers' unions \u2014 lambasted the action as politically motivated. Union leaders rejected the charge, saying they had also enacted strikes during the previous center-left government.",
      "About half of those who walked off the job were teachers and the rest included doctors, dentists, nurses, social workers and other medical practitioners. Their demands varied between industries, but pay, staffing levels and working conditions were the central complaints prompting the strike.",
      "The action came amid steep government cuts to public spending and record numbers of New Zealanders leaving the country \u2014 particularly for neighboring Australia, where medical practitioners are lured by higher salaries and lower living costs.",
      "Several major highways remained closed on Thursday night and residents of some South Island regions remained on alert as rivers rose and threatened to breach their banks. Winds were due to ease by Friday, although the authorities urged caution for travelers.",
      "Bans on fireworks and fires were enacted for much of the country and would remain in place for the rest of the week, the national fire service said. The strong winds whipped up wildfires during both Monday's and Thursday's storms and fire fighters hadn't been able to quell the worst of the blazes by Thursday night.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s location in the southern latitudes and the mountain ranges that run the length of the country can produce wild weather throughout the year.",

      "Goldman and her colleagues analyzed nasal swabs and symptom reports from more than 800 students and staff in a large school district in Kansas City from November 2022 to May 2023.",
      "They found that overall, more than 85% of all participants had at least one respiratory virus detected during that time and more than 80% had an episode of acute respiratory illness \u2014 though not necessarily at the same time.",
      "More telling, 92% of pre-K and elementary school kids had a virus detected, compared with about 86% of middle school students, about 77% of high school students and 76% of staff.",
      "The pre-K kids, ages 3 to 5, had the highest rates of actual illness, too, the study found.",
      "Most of the viruses were the kinds that cause the common cold, including rhinovirus, which was found in 65% of participants, and types of seasonal coronavirus detected in about 30%. The virus that causes COVID-19 was found in about 15% of those studied.",
      "The new study provides a baseline look at the burden of viruses in school settings, Goldman said.",

      "As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "Traditionalist Catholics are celebrating after Pope Leo XIV approved the old Latin Mass at St. Peter's Basilica",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Traditionalist Catholics who felt abandoned after Pope Francis restricted the old Latin Mass rejoiced Saturday as they prepared to celebrate the traditional liturgy in St. Peter's Basilica with the explicit approval of Pope Leo XIV.",
      "Cardinal Raymond Burke, the conservative American figurehead, was to celebrate the old Mass for pilgrims on Saturday during their Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome. Another cardinal, Matteo Zuppi of Italy, celebrated a packed vespers service for them Friday night.",
      "For many traditionalists, the moment was a tangible sign that Leo might be more sympathetic to their plight, after they felt rejected by Francis and his 2021 crackdown on the old liturgy.",
      "Francis had taken action after the spread of the ancient liturgy, especially in the United States, dovetailed with the rise of religiously inspired political conservatism and decline in church attendance at more progressive parishes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful,\u201d said Rub\u00e9n Peret\u00f3 Rivas, a professor of medieval philosophy at Argentina\u2019s Universidad Nacional de Cuyo and an organizer of the pilgrimage. \u201cThe first signs of Pope Leo are those of dialogue and listening, truly listening to everyone.\u201d",
      "The latest rounds in the liturgy wars date back to the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church. Among the reforms was the celebration of the Mass in the vernacular, rather than Latin, with the priest facing the faithful in the pews rather than the altar.",
      "In the decades that followed, the old Latin Mass was still available but not widespread. In those years too, the Vatican was dealing with the growth of a schismatic group that rejected the Vatican II reforms and celebrated the Latin Mass exclusively, the Society of St. Pius X.",
      "Pope Benedict XVI, both as a cardinal and later as pontiff, tried to heal the schism and bring the SSPX group back under Rome\u2019s wing, fearing the spread of a parallel, pre-Vatican II church.",
      "In 2007, Benedict relaxed restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass as part of his overall outreach to traditionalists.",
      "\u201cWhat earlier generations held as sacred remains sacred and great for us too,\u201d Benedict wrote at the time.",
      "In one of the most controversial acts of his pontificate, Francis in 2021 reversed Benedict\u2019s 2007 reform and reinstated restrictions on celebrating the old Mass. Francis said its spread had become a source of division in the church and been exploited by Catholics opposed to Vatican II.",
      "Under Francis' restrictions, bishops must petition Rome if, say, a newly ordained priest wants to celebrate the ancient rite. The Holy See must give its OK if a bishop wants to designate an additional parish church for the Masses, forcing some celebrations to be held in far-flung church halls.",
      "Rather than heal the divisions, though, Francis\u2019 crackdown seemed to further drive a wedge.",
      "\u201cWe are orphans,\u201d said Christian Marquant, a French organizer of the pilgrimage.",
      "Leo, history's first American pope, was elected with a broad consensus among cardinals and has said his aim is unity and reconciliation in the church. Many conservatives and traditionalists urged him to heal the liturgical divisions that spread over the Latin Mass, especially.",
      "After Leo's election, Marquant wrote Leo a letter on behalf of some 70 traditionalist groups asking, among other things, for permission to celebrate a Mass according to the ancient rite in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica during the traditionalists' annual pilgrimage to Rome.",

      "Burke, who had an audience with Leo on Aug. 22, gave him the letter. Leo phoned the archpriest of St. Peter\u2019s, Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, and gave his permission, Marquant said.",
      "Francis, too, had allowed Latin Masses to be celebrated in the basilica even in the immediate aftermath of his 2021 crackdown, but only by low-ranking priests. In 2023 and 2024, the traditionalists couldn't find anyone willing to approach Francis to ask permission, and no Mass was celebrated, Marquant said.",
      "In July, leaked Vatican documents undermined Francis\u2019 stated reason for having imposed the restrictions in the first place: Francis had said he was responding to \u201cthe wishes expressed\u201d by bishops around the world who had responded to a 2020 Vatican survey, as well as the Vatican doctrine office\u2019s own opinion.",
      "But the documents suggested that the majority of Catholic bishops who responded to the survey had expressed general satisfaction with the old Latin Mass and warned that restricting it would \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d",
      "James Rodio, a psychiatrist and father of three, has been attending the traditional Latin Mass with his family for nearly three decades in Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "\u201cI was just struck by the reverence and beauty and symbolism in action and gesture, and of course the content too,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.",
      "Even though Rodio had always had access to a traditional Mass in Cleveland, he and other parishioners felt \u201cfrustration\u201d at Francis\u2019 crackdown and the restrictions that he imposed.",
      "\u201cBehind it all, there was a sadness\u201d and sense that Francis didn\u2019t understand them, he said. \u201cHow could any organization have an approach for 16 or 17 centuries and then say it wasn\u2019t valid anymore?\u201d",
      "Rodio said he and his fellow parishioners are optimistic about Leo and hope he will allow more parishes to offer the traditional liturgy. While Rodio would welcome something explicit, Leo need not overturn Francis outright: He can just instruct the Vatican liturgy office to generously approve individual requests from bishops as they come in.",
      "In recent weeks, the diocese of Cleveland received a two-year extension to keep allowing the Latin Mass at two diocesan churches.",
      "\u201cMy guess is Leo may try to do a lot by not doing a lot publicly,\u201d Rodio said.",

      "\u201cThis is the happiest day because I\u2019m celebrating my 15th birthday,\u201d Casas said, adding that she'd stayed up all night thinking about the big day.",
      "It was the first time she wore professional makeup or a formal gown, or rode in a limousine, where she joined 28 other older women chosen by the Sue\u00f1os Hechos (Dreams Come True) Foundation for belated birthday celebrations.",
      "Quincea\u00f1eras are a time-honored tradition in Latin America, a often lavish celebration that marks a girl's passage into adulthood when she turns 15. But for the 29 women \u2014 mostly grandmothers \u2014 honored at this party, childhood hardships put any kind of celebration out of reach.",
      "They rode in a limousine through the streets of northwestern Bogot\u00e1 in to lively music, leaning out the car's open roof to wave excitedly at passersby who recorded them on their phones.",
      "\u201cI never rode in anything like that. I\u2019d only seen them in pictures, but I never imagined I\u2019d be in one,\u201d Casas said. \u201cI blew kisses to everyone,\u201d she added with a laugh.",
      "Casas said that on her 15th birthday, she didn\u2019t receive a single greeting. It was just another workday for her as a domestic employee in a wealthy Bogot\u00e1 home, where her mother also worked.",
      "Mar\u00eda Isabel Carmona, 71, had a similar story. She recalled her 15th birthday party as a special breakfast of hot chocolate and fried eggs.",

      "Even though it\u2019s a very common tradition in Colombia, not all households can afford such a party in a country where the government estimates 31% of the population lives in poverty. The World Bank ranks the country as one of the most unequal in Latin America.",

      "Russia has grappled with a shrinking and aging population for decades, with President Vladimir Putin viewing it as a threat to national security",
      "For a quarter century, President Vladimir Putin has faced the specter of Russia's shrinking and aging population.",
      "In 1999, a year before he came to power, the number of babies born in Russia plunged to its lowest recorded level. In 2005, Putin said the demographic woes needed to be resolved by maintaining \"social and economic stability.\u201d",
      "In 2019, he said the problem still \u201chaunted\u201d the country.",
      "As recently as Thursday, he told a Kremlin demographic conference that increasing births was \u201ccrucial\u201d for Russia.",
      "Putin has launched initiatives to encourage people to have more children -- from free school meals for large families to awarding Soviet-style \u201chero-mother\u201d medals to women with 10 or more children.",
      "\u201cMany of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers had seven, eight, and even more children,\u201d Putin said in 2023. \u201cLet\u2019s preserve and revive these wonderful traditions. Having many children and a large family must become the norm.\u201d",
      "At first, births in Russia grew with its economic prosperity, from 1.21 million babies born in 1999 to 1.94 million in 2015.",
      "But those hard-won gains are crumbling against a backdrop of financial uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, an exodus of young men and opposition to immigration.",
      "Russia\u2019s population has fallen from 147.6 million in 1990 \u2014 the year before the USSR collapsed \u2014 to 146.1 million this year, according to Russia\u2019s Federal Statistics Service. Since the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea, it has included the peninsula's population of about 2 million, as well as births and deaths there, in its data.",
      "The population also is significantly older. In 1990, 21.1% was 55 or older, government data said. In 2024, that figure was 30%.",
      "Since the 2015 peak, the number of births has fallen annually, and deaths are now outpacing births. There were only 1.22 million live births last year \u2014 marginally above the 1999 low. Demographer Alexei Raksha reported the number of babies born in Russia in February 2025 was the lowest monthly figure in over two centuries.",
      "Russia is trying new restrictions to halt the backslide and embrace what it calls \u201ctraditional family values\u201d with laws banning the promotion of abortion and \u201cchild-free ideology\u201d and outlawing all LGBTQ+ activism.",
      "Officials believe such values are \u201ca magic wand\u201d for solving demographic problems, said Russian feminist scholar Sasha Talaver.",
      "In the government's view, women might be financially independent, but they should be \u201cwilling and very excited to take up this additional work of reproduction in the name of patriotism and Russian strength,\" she said.",
      "In Russia, as in much of the West, shrinking births are usually linked with economic turbulence. Young couples in cramped apartments, unable to buy their own homes or who fear for their jobs, usually have less confidence they can afford raising a child.",
      "But Russia is saddled with a harsh demographic history.",
      "About 27 million Soviet citizens died in World War II, diminishing the male population dramatically.",
      "As the country was beginning to recover, the Soviet Union collapsed, and births tumbled again.",
      "The number of Russian women in their 20s and early 30s is small, said Jenny Mathers of the University of Aberystwyth in Wales, leaving authorities \"desperate to get as many babies as possible out of this much smaller number of women.\u201d",

      "Others are controversial, such as one-time payments of about $1,200 for pregnant teenagers in some regions. Officials say these aim to support vulnerable mothers, but critics say they encourage such pregnancies.",
      "Still other programs seem mostly symbolic. Since 2022, Russia has created state holidays like Family, Love and Fidelity Day in July, and Pregnant Women\u2019s Day -\u2013 celebrated on April 7 and Oct. 7.",

It's \u201ca completely different story\u201d at state-run clinics, she said.",
      "An increasing number of laws limit access to abortion. While the procedure remains legal and widely available, more private clinics no longer offer abortion services. New legislation has also curbed the sale of abortion-inducing pills, a move that also affects some emergency contraceptives.",
      "Women are encouraged to go to state clinics, where waits are longer and some sites refuse to do abortions on certain days. By the time patients have completed compulsory counseling and mandatory waiting periods of between 48 hours and a week, they risk surpassing the time frame for a legal abortion.",
      "Abortions have steadily decreased under these laws, although experts say the number of procedures already was falling. Still, there hasn't been a corresponding increase in births, and activists believe restricting abortion will only harm the health of women and children.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you will get from this is illegal abortions. That means more deaths: more children\u2019s deaths and more women\u2019s deaths,\u201d says Russian journalist and feminist activist Zalina Marshenkulova.",

      "The worst European fears about Trump\u2019s second term have not yet come to pass. Trump has not withdrawn U.S. troops from Europe or pulled out of NATO. His global tariff blitz has not resulted in the threatened 100% import taxes on European goods.",

      "A government program in Spain is training African migrants as shepherds to tackle rural depopulation and job shortages",
      "LOS CORTIJOS, Spain -- The bells and bleats faded as Osam Abdulmumen, a migrant from Sudan, herded sheep back from pasture, the sun setting over a centuries-old farm in Spain\u2019s arid heartland.",
      "From dawn to dusk, Abdulmumen, 25, has looked over a flock of 400 animals for months in Los Cortijos, a village of 850 people in the plains of Castile-La Mancha, the region in central Spain made famous by the 17th-century classic \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d",
      "Los Cortijos is among hundreds of rural villages and towns in the region coping with depopulation that has made it tough to fill a job that has existed since biblical times, but which Spaniards seldom pursue these days: shepherding.",
      "To fill that gap and also find work for recent migrants, a government program is training arrivals like Abdulmumen \u2014 many from countries in Africa, but also from Venezuela and Afghanistan \u2014 whom local farms depend upon to herd the animals whose milk produces central Spain\u2019s prized sheep\u2019s milk cheese.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to work in my country, but there are too many problems,\" Abdulmumen said inside his tidy, bare one-bedroom apartment in town, speaking in his limited Spanish. He said he left because of violence but was reticent to say more. \u201cMy family can\u2019t do much right now. That\u2019s why I want to buy them things. A house, too.\u201d",
      "The challenges of finding workers in rural Spain are personal for \u00c1lvaro Esteban, the fifth-generation proprietor of the farm. Esteban left Los Cortijos himself for eight years, first to study history at a nearby university, and then to Wales, where he worked odd jobs before returning home during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see my future here,\u201d said Esteban, 32. \u201cBut due to life circumstances, I decided to come back and \u2026 being here made me say, \u2018Well, maybe there is a future.'\u201d",
      "Spain's interior has experienced decades of rural exodus, starting around 1950, as generations of young people left the countryside in search of work and opportunity in cities. Today, about 81% percent of the country's residents live in urban areas. In 1950, about 60% did, according to the Bank of Spain.",
      "Farmers and other agricultural laborers represent less than 4% of Spain's working population, even as the country is one of Europe\u2019s leading agricultural producers.",
      "After he came back, Esteban took the same shepherding course as Abdulmumen, and looked at how he could modernize his family\u2019s farm. He works alongside his 61-year-old father and Abdulmumen, using drones to monitor the animals and pastures. He also makes cheese that he later sells at markets and to restaurants.",
      "The new shepherds begin their training in a bare classroom just outside the fortressed medieval city of Toledo, where, on a recent morning, nearly two dozen migrants learned about coaxing flocks of sheep, handling them and guiding suction cups onto their teats.",
      "They are taught the fundamentals over five days \u2014 just enough time to convey the basics to students who often speak only halting Spanish, but are eager to work. After a day of on-site training, and if they are authorized to work in Spain, they can apply to be matched with a farm.",
      "Sharifa Issah, a 27-year-old migrant from Ghana, said she wanted to train to work with sheep because she had tended to animals back home.",

      "Since 2022, about 460 students, most of them migrants, have gone through the program, which is funded by the regional government, according to program coordinator Pedro Luna. Besides the 51 graduates now employed as shepherds, another 15 work at slaughterhouses, he said, while others found jobs on olive and other fruit farms.",
      "Many students are asylum-seekers, like Abdulmumen, who is from the Sudanese region of Darfur. Organizations including the International Red Cross connect migrants with Luna\u2019s program.",
      "Like many of his peers, Abdulmumen's journey to Spain was anything but simple. At 18, he left Sudan, arriving first in Egypt, where he found work in construction. Over the next four years, he moved between Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt again before finally crossing into Ceuta \u2014 the Spanish enclave on Morocco\u2019s northern coast \u2014 where he applied for asylum. Eventually, he made his way to mainland Spain.",
      "Today, Abdulmumen lives alone in Los Cortijos, where he is one of three Africans, he said. At home, he studies Spanish and watches television. On weekends, he plays soccer with people around his age who visit from a nearby city, but the lack of young people in town is challenging, he said.",
      "Abdulmumen's days begin at five in the morning with Muslim prayer before he heads to the farm, where he stays past sundown. About once every month, he calls his family in Sudan, where a civil war has raged since April 2023, but cell service is spotty in their village. A month can become two, he said. He last saw them seven years ago.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only difficult part,\u201d he said, a small prayer mat beside him on the floor. He earns about 1,300 euros ($1,510) a month, slightly above Spain's minimum wage. With that, he said he can send some money home once every couple of months.",
      "\u201cAfter, I look for another job, but not now. I like this job, it's more calm and the town is, too. I like living here in the town,\u201d he said.",
      "Without help from migrants like Abdulmumen, Esteban said many livestock farms in the region \u2014 including his family\u2019s \u2014 would be forced to close down in the next five to 10 years. Very few young people want to work rural jobs. Even fewer have the know-how, he said.",
      "\u201cMost of the businesses that exist right now won\u2019t have anyone to take over, because the children don\u2019t want to follow in their parents\u2019 footsteps,\u201d Esteban said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard-hit sector, very neglected.\u201d",

      "A British judge has sentenced five men for their roles in an arson attack in London that authorities say was masterminded by Russian intelligence as part of a wider campaign of sabotage and disruption",
      "LONDON -- A British judge on Friday sentenced five men for their roles in an arson attack in London that authorities say was masterminded by Russian intelligence as part of a wider campaign of sabotage and disruption.",
      "The sentences ranged from seven to 17 years in prison.",
      "The men were involved in a plot to set fire to a warehouse in east London in March 2024 that contained satellite communication devices destined for Ukraine. British prosecutors said that the arson \u2014 organized on behalf of the Wagner paramilitary group \u2014 was intimately connected to the Russian state and likely linked to another arson attack against a warehouse in Spain.",
      "The fire is one of at least 25 arson or explosives plots across Europe linked to Russia by Western officials that The Associated Press has documented since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "European intelligence officials have told the AP that the risk of death or serious injury is rising as saboteurs directed by Russia set fires near homes and businesses, plant explosives or build bombs. The pattern of attacks is similar across Europe and the goal, the officials say, is to undermine support for Ukraine, sow fear and create conflict.",
      "\u201cThis offence was part of a series of European-wide sabotage operations,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Penny said.",
      "The actions of Dylan Earl \u2014 the British man who arranged the arson \u2014 constituted a \u201csustained campaign of terrorism and sabotage on U.K. soil, carried out in support of a foreign power \u2014 the Russian Federation \u2014 and its war of aggression against Ukraine,\u201d Penny said.",
      "The sentences were the first a British court imposed for violating the National Security Act, which was introduced in 2023 to address threats from foreign states including espionage and sabotage. U.K. counterterrorism police said that three men were arrested under the act on Thursday on suspicion of spying for Russia.",
      "Sentencing Earl, 21, to 17 years in prison, Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said that he was a member of numerous pro-Russia propaganda channels on Telegram and part of a \u201cpernicious\u201d plot organized by Moscow. Earl played \u201ca leading role in terrorist activities,\u201d she said.",
      "The arson in East London caused 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) in damage to a warehouse owned by a Ukrainian couple who shipped StarLink satellite communication devices to Ukraine. The devices are often used by the Ukrainian military.",
      "The couple also own a business on the outskirts of Madrid that was set on fire 10 days after the attack in London, a counterterrorism officer from the Metropolitan Police told the court in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe method used, the time of night, the time of year, and the business targeted strongly suggest the two incidents ... may be linked,\u201d Penny said, reading the officer\u2019s statement.",
      "During the trial, the jury was shown messages where Earl and his co-conspirators also talked about burning down London businesses owned by Evgeny Chichvarkin \u2014 a Russian tycoon who delivered supplies to Ukraine \u2014 and kidnapping him.",
      "At sentencing, the court heard how Earl also tried to pay someone identified as a serving British soldier for intelligence for the Wagner Group \u2014 a mercenary organization whose operations were taken over by Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry in 2023.",
      "Earl also discussed burning down a warehouse in the Czech Republic for 35,000 pounds ($47,000), a day after the London arson, kidnapping another billionaire for the purposes of extortion and the need to collect bank card details on European residents.",
      "Earl\u2019s defense attorney Paul Hynes painted him as a \u201csad\u201d fantasist who boasted to his Russian recruiter that he could be \u201cthe best spy you have ever seen\u201d as well as of having ties to international criminal gangs.",

      "Police and intelligence services are grappling with similar attacks throughout Europe, including where people have been recruited online.",
      "Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Polish authorities have investigated multiple arson attacks on shopping centers, industrial areas and apartment buildings which show how Russian operatives often \u201cfollow the same pattern\u201d in attacks across Europe, said Jacek Dobrzy\u0144ski spokesperson for Poland\u2019s security minister.

      "The goal of the arson attacks is to \u201cintimidate people,\u201d create conflict and to undermine European societies and support for Ukraine, Dobrzy\u0144ski said. It\u2019s also about testing the response of law enforcement and \u2014 because the plots often involve multiple people and lines of investigation \u2014 draining police resources, he said.",
      "Five men were sentenced Friday alongside Earl for their roles in the arson.",
      "Both Earl and his co-conspirator Jake Reeves, 23, \u201cwillingly acted as hostile agents on behalf of the Russian state,\u201d said Commander Dominic Murphy, head of Counter Terrorism Policing at the Metropolitan Police. Reeves was sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "But Nii Mensah, 23, Jakeem Rose, 23; Ugnius Asmena, 20 didn\u2019t know they were working for Russia. They were found guilty of aggravated arson and sentenced to nine years; eight years, 10 months, and seven years in prison, respectively.

Accounting for the time already spent in prison, Mosquera won't be eligible for release for more than 40 years.",
      "While describing the murders as \u201cpremeditated and thoroughly wicked,\" the judge did not impose a whole-life order on Mosquera, which would mean he would never be eligible for parole. He said that was partly because of his lack of previous convictions in Colombia or the U.K., and the fact that he \u201cmay have been brutalized\u201d as a child when witnessing the murder of other children.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.",
      "Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.",
      "Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.",
      "Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.",
      "\u201cThe risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,\u201d Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.",
      "There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.",
      "After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.",
      "\u201cI still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,\u201d Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.",
      "Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Anyone who watched U.S. President Donald Trump vow to condition financial aid to cash-strapped Argentina on the outcome of a \u201cvery big\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d vote in the South American country would be forgiven for thinking that his close ideological ally, Argentine President Javier Milei, was up for reelection.",
      "But no. The vote that Trump was talking about earlier this month is, in fact, a midterm election for less than half of the Argentine Congress.",
      "Now the explosive comments, combined with a dizzying series of scandals and setbacks for Milei, have cranked up the pressure on Argentina\u2019s libertarian president and transformed Sunday's limited vote into a major political test that could help determine the fate of Milei\u2019s free-market experiment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made it to the elections on our feet, and on Sunday Argentina will really change,\u201d Milei said in a fiery final campaign speech late Thursday from the port city of Rosario.",
      "At the start of the year, pollsters and pundits were predicting a smashing success for Milei in the midterms.",
      "His huge cuts to state spending delivered Argentina's first fiscal surplus in nearly 15 years and pulled down monthly inflation from 25.5% to 2%. Argentines celebrated relief from ever-rising prices and took comfort in a strong peso that made it cheaper for them to snap up imported goods and vacation abroad.",
      "With his approval ratings high, Milei took victory laps through Europe, Latin America and, most frequently, Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, railing against the evils of socialism and the corruption of the political elite. He pushed key deregulation laws through an opposition-dominated Congress, allying with the right-wing PRO party of former President Mauricio Macri and striking deals with moderate governors.",
      "How quickly the mood turned.",
      "Milei's aura of infallibility first began to crack in February, when he promoted a dodgy memecoin on his social media account that quickly collapsed, leading to $250 million in losses for investors. Then in August, Milei's powerful sister was accused of taking bribes from a government medicine supplier. She denies wrongdoing.",
      "The latest blow came earlier this month, when Milei\u2019s leading candidate in Buenos Aires province, Jos\u00e9 Luis Espert, dropped out of the midterm race after admitting he received $200,000 from a businessman indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking. He says it was for consulting services.",
      "The controversies have hurt Milei's reputation as a straight-talking outsider determined to tear down the corrupt establishment, experts say, particularly at this time of harsh austerity.",
      "\u201cIt was the first wake-up call when people started to ask, maybe (Milei and Karina) are asking us to make sacrifices that they're not making themselves,\" said Eugenia Mitchelstein, the chair of the social sciences department at Buenos Aires\u2019 San Andr\u00e9s University.",
      "Tactical errors compounded matters. Milei ran an aggressive campaign strategy in some two dozen provincial elections in recent months that pitted a slew of unknowns from his scrappy libertarian party against more established rivals.",
      "His decision to forgo any attempt at coalition-building alienated potential political allies, who punished Milei by passing spending measures in Congress and overturning his vetoes.",
      "The run-up to the midterms \u2014 in which half the seats in the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate are up for grabs \u2014 has also been rough. Although veteran politician Diego Santilli is now at the top of the party's Buenos Aires list after Espert stood down over the scandal, voters will still see Espert on the ballot Sunday after electoral authorities ruled it was too late to print new ones.",
      "The other Buenos Aires candidate, Karen Reichardt, is a former model and actress who has recently come under fire for old social media posts attacking national soccer hero Lionel Messi and insulting her political enemies with racially insensitive language. She did not respond to a request for comment.",

Bessent said he was working on another $20 billion loan from private banks, and Trump said the U.S. would even boost beef imports from Argentina to bring down U.S. meat prices.",
      "But it seems that not even such dramatic moves from the world's biggest economy could restore faith in the famously volatile peso. Argentine investors \u2014 who can more easily take money out of Argentina since Milei's government scrapped capital controls this year \u2014 continued ditching pesos.

      "In Argentina, Trump's warning that U.S. assistance was contingent on Milei\u2019s victory in the vote breathed new life into the opposition Peronist party, which urged Argentines long wary of U.S. interventionism to punish Milei on Sunday.",
      "\u201cCompatriots, Argentina is a country too great and dignified to depend on the whims of a foreign leader,\u201d said former Peronist President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a video message Thursday from her Buenos Aires apartment, where she\u2019s serving out a six-year sentence for corruption.",
      "Markets reeled as investors fretted that the U.S. aid might not come at all. Consultants tried to parse Trump's cryptic demand that Milei clinch a congressional victory. Does it mean Milei increasing his party\u2019s tiny congressional minority? Does it mean securing enough seats to defend his vetoes?",
      "With only some congressional seats up for renewal, a landslide win for Milei\u2019s party wouldn\u2019t give it a majority in Congress.",
      "Even Milei\u2019s supporters took to social media to express unease, with many attacking then-Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein for mishandling the situation. Werthein tendered his resignation without explanation late Tuesday.",

      "Doris Brown\u2019s home in Northeast Houston becomes a refuge for neighbors during power outages thanks to her solar panel and battery system",
      "HOUSTON -- Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. \u201cThere were no lights, nowhere,\u201d said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. \u201cI didn't even know it.\u201d",
      "Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. \u201cCall everybody,\u201d she told the neighbor.",
      "Soon around 15 \u201cneighbors and neighbors' neighbors\u201d were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over.",
      "\u201cThere were people sleeping everywhere,\u201d said Brown, 75. She was happy to be \u201ca port in a storm,\u201d despite one downside: \u201cThey ate all my snacks.\u201d",
      "Brown's house is a \u201chub home,\u201d one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens \u2014 not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses.",
      "The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s us helping us,\u201d said Brown.",
      "The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation.",
      "People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional \u2014 requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center.",
      "But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,\u201d said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.",
      "The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Shoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for\u2019,\u201d said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.",
      "WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up.",
      "WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.",
      "When the D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.",
      "The pilot had its challenges \u2014 some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them.",
      "Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.",
      "\u201cYou have to build that trust,\u201d said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery\u2019s co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. \u201cI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,\u201d he said.",
      "About a dozen people are signed up on Espinoza's \u201croster,\u201d but he said the hub is there for anyone in need, prioritizing older neighbors and those with children or medical conditions.",

      "\u201cCommunities do need to be thinking more strategically about resilience,\u201d said Kotwis.",
      "That preparedness begins with connections between neighbors, said Renae Hanvin, CEO and founder of Resilient Ready and an expert on \u201csocial capital,\u201d or the \u201cconnections, trust and cooperation between people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the missing link in the disaster resilience ecosystem,\u201d said Hanvin. \u201cAt the end of the day, the first thing you need (in an emergency) to help you is a person.\u201d",
      "As disasters worsen, first responders simply can\u2019t help everyone at once, she said, so neighbors must think of themselves as \u201czero responders.\"",
      "Many communities have also turned to \u201cresilience centers,\u201d or locally trusted institutions like community centers or churches that are outfitted with backup power, emergency supplies, and even year-round social services.",
      "Ideally, resilience investments aren't an either-or decision, said Dori Wolfe, SUN senior Texas program associate. \u201cHub homes are one piece of the web, and there should be a resilience center at the center of each of these nodes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need all of it.\u201d",
      "Solar United Neighbors and West Street Recovery planned to expand the program this fall as part of a $54 million grant awarded to Harris County by the EPA.",
      "They intended to grow the number of hub homes to 30, and add more batteries to existing ones to better run heating and air conditioning during outages. The money would have also funded a local resilience center.",

      "NEW YORK -- The stunning indictment that led to the arrest of more than 30 people, including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and other NBA figures, on charges of illegal sports betting has drawn new scrutiny of the booming business of professional sports gambling across the U.S.",
      "Since widespread legalization, the multibillion-dollar industry has made it easy to place wagers on everything from the outcome of games to that of a single play with just a few taps of a cellphone. It\u2019s just about impossible to go to a basketball, football, baseball or other pro game today \u2014 or watch a matchup on TV \u2014 without seeing ads for sports betting.",
      "Fans can place wagers from their stadium seats, while \u201cBet\u201d tickers scroll on TV sports broadcasts. Star athletes are frequently at the center of ads promoting it all.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s indictment, federal investigators accused Rozier and other defendants of breaking the law by exploiting private information about players to win bets on NBA games. Rozier\u2019s lawyer, Jim Trusty, said in a statement that his client is \u201cnot a gambler\u201d and \u201clooks forward to winning this fight.\u201d",
      "A separate indictment alleges Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and others participated in a conspiracy to fix high-stakes card games. Billups' attorney declined to comment Thursday.",
      "Regulating sports wagering has proven to be a challenge \u2014 and experts warn about the ramifications for gamblers who typically lose money. Professional leagues' own role in promoting gambling has raised eyebrows.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Sports betting is probably as old as sports itself. But in the U.S., legal gambling really took off in 2018.",
      "That's when the Supreme Court struck down the Professional Amateur Sports Protection Act, which barred sports betting in most states. Once allowed only in Nevada, sports betting is now permitted online or in retail locations in 38 states and Washington, D.C. Missouri will become the 39th state on Dec. 1.",
      "Experts say the biggest jump has been online, through smartphone apps and platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. Through the third quarter of this year, legal sports betting generated $10 billion in revenue, up about 19% from the same period a year ago, according to the American Gaming Association.",
      "The industry argues that legal wagering generates money for states and can deter illegal betting. Major operators point to technology they use to monitor suspicious activity. FanDuel said Thursday's news illustrates \u201cthe stark contrast between legal and illegal betting markets.\u201d",
      "There is plenty of money on the table both for those who place winning bets and the platforms that make it possible. The NBA and other pro sports leagues have also created revenue streams by partnering with sportsbooks and reaping advertising dollars.",
      "Live game stats provided by leagues are key to the sports world\u2019s relationship with the gambling industry. When you're able to bet what the next pitch in a baseball game is going to be, that's because Major League Baseball is selling data to platforms \u201cfor a pretty high price,\" according to Isaac Rose-Berman, whose research focuses on sports betting as a fellow at the American Institute for Boys and Men.",
      "The NBA has a partnership with Sportradar for its data rights. Sportradar, in turn, provides FanDuel Sportsbook official NBA statistics. When the deal was announced in 2022, Sportradar touted it as a way \u201cto monetize our long-term partnership with the NBA.\"",
      "Each state has its own regulations and tax rates for sports betting. A handful restrict where you can place bets \u2014 allowing users to use mobile apps, but only while they're physically inside a casino or within a certain radius of a stadium, for example. Others limit which betting platforms you can use or what you can bet on.",
      "\u201cStates sort of opened up a can of worms, and now some of them are starting to realize just how crazy this sports betting world sort is,\u201d said Wayne Taylor, a professor of marketing at Southern Methodist University.",

      "President Donald Trump will be in Japan and South Korea next week and he's expected to promote an epic windfall in investments for U.S. factories and projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is going to Japan and South Korea next week to promote an epic financial windfall \u2014 at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories, a natural gas pipeline and other projects.",
      "Japan and South Korea made those financial commitments in August to try to get Trump to ratchet down his planned tariff rates from 25% to 15%. But as the U.S. president is set to depart Friday night for Asia, the pledges are more of a loose end than money in the bank for American industry.",
      "Japan pledged $550 billion in investments, but it wants the money to benefit its own companies, making that a condition in a memorandum released in September. As of Monday, Japan has a new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, who has expressed respect for Trump but is operating in an untested coalition government.",
      "South Korea offered $350 billion \u2014 but wants a swap line for U.S. dollars to facilitate its investments and seeks to fund the transactions through loan guarantees. Otherwise, the commitment could sink its own economy.",
      "The investment arrangements are unusual for trade frameworks, and Trump maintains that he will personally direct how the money is spent, enabling him to pick winners and losers. Weeks of talks have yet to produce any breakthroughs on how the investments would go forward even though both nations want to preserve their relationship with America.",
      "Still, ahead of the trip, Trump was radiating optimism that his tariffs had forced investments to fuel what he believes will be an economic boom starting next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done well, as you know, with Japan, with South Korea,\u201d Trump told Republican senators Tuesday. \u201cWithout the tariffs, you could have never made the deal. I\u2019ll tell you what. Tariffs equal national security.\u201d",
      "For Trump, the investments are also about demonstrating America\u2019s strength before a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping while he is in South Korea. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday described Trump's strategy in part as \u201cencouraging allied investment in America\u2019s industrial future\u201d to counter Chinese manufacturers.",
      "But Japan and South Korea are also competing against China \u2014 which is pivoting aggressively into electric vehicles, computer chips and other technologies. There is a risk that mandating investment in the U.S. could weaken allies that are closer geographically to China, said Christopher Smart, managing partner at the Arbroath Group, a geopolitical strategy firm.",
      "\u201cThey need to invest in their own countries,\u201d said Smart, who was a senior economic aide in the Obama White House. He said Trump was \u201cgoing to extract investment money\u201d from the countries while also erecting \"tariff walls\u201d that could make it harder for them to sell goods in America, a rather lopsided view of how alliances work.",
      "Few experts believe Japan and South Korea would agree with the Trump administration's framing that their U.S. investments are a way to compete against China.",
      "\u201cIt is really about lowering tariffs and avoiding Trump\u2019s wrath,\u201d said Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Asia Policy Studies.",
      "There is an expectation that Japan and South Korea both want to resolve any hurdles on the investments and will take steps to achieve \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with Trump, said William Chou, a senior fellow focused on Japan at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "Chou pointed to Nippon Steel's agreement to purchase U.S. Steel this year as an example of how Japan can work with the Trump administration. The president had initially opposed the merger, but later backed it with an agreement that gave the U.S. government some control over the acquired company.",
      "Similarly, the memorandum of understanding on Japan\u2019s $550 million investment would also give the U.S. government input on how the money would be spent. It provides for a committee led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to propose investments, giving Japan 45 days to respond, with the understanding that the deals would give preference to Japanese contractors and suppliers.",
      "\"Japan came through with the paperwork,\" Lutnick said in a September CNBC interview. \u201cThey gave us $550 billion to invest for the benefit of America, build the Alaska pipeline, build nuclear power plants, make your grid better, do generic antibiotics in America.\"",

      "Target said Thursday that it is eliminating about 1,800 corporate positions in an effort to streamline decision-making and accelerate initiatives to rebuild the flagging discount retailer\u2019s customer base.",
      "About 1,000 employees are expected to receive layoff notices next week, and the company also plans to eliminate about 800 vacant jobs, a company spokesperson said. The cuts represent about 8% of Target's corporate workforce globally, although the majority of the affected employees work at the company's Minneapolis headquarters, the spokesperson said.",
      "Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who is set to become Target's next CEO on Feb. 1, issued a note to personnel on Thursday announcing the downsizing. He said further details would come on Tuesday, and he asked employees at the Minneapolis offices to work from home next week.",
      "\u201cThe truth is, the complexity we\u2019ve created over time has been holding us back,\u201d Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. \u201cToo many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\u201d",
      "Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target's next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company\u2019s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology.",

      "\"Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution,\" he wrote.",
      "Target has reported flat or declining comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 in nine out of the past 11 quarters. The company reported in August that comparable sales dipped 1.9% in its second quarter, when its net income also dropped 21%.",
      "The job cuts will not affect any store employees or workers in Target's sorting, distribution and other supply chain facilities, the company spokesperson said.",
      "The corporate workers losing their jobs will receive pay and benefits until Jan. 8 as well as severance packages, the spokesperson said.",

The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, has opposed tax hikes in the past, including those specifically targeting the rich.",

      "Billionaires would have to pay for tax year 2026, and the money could start being appropriated in 2027. The tax would generate $100 billion in revenue for the state, backers say. The initiative says it's \u201cdesigned to make the State tax system more equitable.\u201d",

Fed officials are cutting their short-term interest rate to buoy the economy and hiring, but they are taking some risk doing so because inflation is still above their 2% target.",
      "The issues of affordability and the cost of necessities are gaining in political importance. Concerns over the costs of rent and groceries have played a key role in the mayoral race in New York City. And Trump, who has acknowledged that the spike in grocery prices under President Joe Biden helped him win the 2024 election, has been considering importing Argentine beef to reduce record-high U.S. beef prices, angering U.S. cattle ranchers.",
      "The cost of ground beef has jumped to $6.32 a pound, a record, in part because of tariffs on imports from countries such as Brazil, which faces a 50% duty. Years of drought that have reduced cattle herds have also raised prices.",
      "Friday's report is forecast to show that inflation rose 3.1% in September from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That would be up from 2.9% in August and the highest in 18 months. On a monthly basis, inflation is projected to be 0.4% in September, the same as in August.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation in September was likely 3.1% for the third straight month. On a monthly basis, core prices likely rose 0.3%, economists project, also for the third straight month.",
      "Such figures are unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting its key rate by another quarter-point when it meets next week, to about 3.9%. It would be the second cut this year and is driven by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's concerns that hiring is weakening and poses a threat to the economy.",
      "Even as inflation has fallen sharply from its peak of 9.1% more than three years ago, it remains a major concern for consumers. About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to an August poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",

      "LANSING, Mich. -- LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.",
      "\u201cWhile this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,\u201d Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.",
      "Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.",
      "In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no \u201celigible activities\u201d had occurred on the site's property in over 120 days.",
      "According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site\u2019s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.",
      "The news was first reported by Crain\u2019s Detroit Business.",
      "The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.",
      "Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.",

      "\u201cWe'll probably start to see motorists be impacted by the sanctions at the pump in the next couple days and it might take five days for that to be fully passed along,\u201d De Haan said, adding that the full impact also depends on whether the Russian or U.S. positions change.",

      "Oil prices have been relatively low for the past few years and last week the cost for barrel of U.S. benchmark crude fell below $57, its lowest level since early 2021. The price for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude did rise near $79 a barrel early this year, just before President Donald Trump took office, a price not necessarily considered outrageously elevated by most analysts.",

      "TOKYO -- Nick Champion de Crespigny marked his debut as captain with a try as a misfiring Australia overcame Japan 19-15 to open its five-match Northern Hemisphere tour Saturday.",
      "De Crespigny became Australia's 92nd test captain after only 72 minutes of test rugby but showed his potential with a physical performance and with the first of Australia's three tries after 13 minutes.",
      "Center Josh Flook and Carlo Tizzano also scored as Australia struggled in wet conditions against Japan's tight defense.",
      "Australia led 14-3 at halftime and was only just hanging on at times as Japan scored two tries to one in the second half. Prop Shuhei Takeuchi and Ben Gunter scored for Japan, keeping the score close, while Tizzano scored for Australia from a powerful lineout drive.",
      "The Wallabies struggled with a malfunctioning lineout after losing locks Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and Josh Canham to injuries in the first half. Handling errors and close marking by Japan prevented Australia from achieving any fluency in the backline.",
      "\u201cIt was a very disappointing game but the scoreline was close and we should take pride in that,\u201d Japan captain Warner Dearns said. \u201cI thought it was a good fight.\u201d",
      "Australia's first test in Japan since 2017 opened a northern tour on which it will play England, Italy, Ireland and France over the next four weekends.",
      "Head coach Joe Schmidt led the Wallabies for the first time against Eddie Jones, his predecessor and now Japan coach. During Jones' second tenure as Australia coach, the Wallabies lost seven of nine tests and were eliminated in group play at the 2023 World Cup.",
      "Schmidt made 13 changes to the team that played New Zealand in Perth in the Wallabies' previous test match. Combinations at times looked brittle and under-developed.",
      "Japan's defense was superb, using quick line-speed to shut down the inside channels and prevent Australia moving the ball wide.",
      "Around the 19th minute, Japan defended its goal line against 27 phases of Australian attack while conceding several penalties and the first of two yellow cards. Japan's backline became more dangerous in the second half after critical handling errors by scrumhalf Shinobu Fujiwara before halftime.",

      "De Crespigny's opening try came after Fujiwara lost the ball and Australia quickly recovered possession. A kick behind the defensive line put Japan under pressure near its goal line for the first time and resulted in a penalty to Australia.",
      "The Wallabies took a quick tap and after several pick-and-go attempts, de Crespigny crashed over. Tane Edmed converted.",
      "Australia battered the Japan line first through 17 phases in the middle of the first half then, after a penalty, for 10 more phases before Japan's Michael Leitch won a turnover. Japan center Charlie Lawrence was shown a yellow card after repeated team offending.",
      "Japan flyhalf Seungsin Lee kicked a penalty to make the score 7-3 and two minutes later Australia finally managed to crack open the defense. From a scrum, Edmed looped Hunter Paisami at first receiver and linked with Andrew Kellaway, who sent Flook on a 30-meter dash to the line.",
      "Takeuchi scored after a neat interchange at the back of Japan's lineout in the 53rd minute. Fujiwara passed to Leitch, then held the ball up to Takeuchi who pierced the defense.",
      "Tizzano's try from a lineout drive gave Australia a 19-8 lead before Gunter's try, converted by Seungsin Lee cut the lead to four points and set up a tense last 10 minutes.",
      "Prop Aidan Ross took the field in the 58th minute to become the fifth player to play test rugby for both Australia and New Zealand after playing for the All Blacks in 2021.",

      "Ohtani's homer Friday didn't do much for Los Angeles' chances after a flop by the Dodgers' pitchers.

      "China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys have joined pandas as diplomatic envoys to Europe",
      "With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.",
      "These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time \u2014 on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.",
      "As with \u201c panda diplomacy,\u201d some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.",
      "Three golden monkeys arrived at France\u2019s Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and France.",
      "Another trio of golden monkeys arrived at the Pairi Daiza zoo in Hainaut, Belgium, in May. The zoo distributed Belgian and Chinese hand flags to visitors on the day the monkeys arrived.",
      "After a monthlong quarantine, the two sets of monkeys made their public debuts. So far, they appear to be in good health, according to the two zoos, adapting to new climates outside Asia for the first time.",
      "At Pairi Daiza, the habitat enclosure for Liu Yun, Lu Lu and Juan Juan includes traditional Chinese gazebos with red columns and gray-tiled roofs, where the monkeys spend much of their time jumping between logs and rope ladders and scrambling over roofs.",
      "\u201cThe diplomatic aspect comes from this cultural awareness,\u201d said Pairi Daiza spokesperson Johan Vreys.",
      "The hope is to build longstanding scientific exchanges between the zoos and Chinese authorities, said Ana\u00efs Maury, the communications director for the Beauval Zoo.",
      "The zoo is in discussions with China to launch joint research and conservation programs \u201csimilar to those already in place for other emblematic species like pandas,\u201d Maury said.",
      "Both giant pandas and golden snub-nosed monkeys are endangered animals that are unique to China and they can only be moved outside the country with approval from the central government, said Elena Songster, an environmental historian at St. Mary\u2019s College of California.",
      "While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\"",
      "When pandas stepped, rolled, scratched and stumbled onto the world stage in recent decades, they quickly became symbols of modern China \u2014 in part to due to their own \u201ccuddly cuteness\u201d and deft diplomatic presentation, said Susan Brownell, a China historian at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.",
      "The original soft power couple from post-war China was a pair of giant pandas, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, sent to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, which led to the establishment of the world\u2019s first Communist state.",
      "In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.",
      "Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.",

      "It\u2019s unclear exactly how to evaluate the diplomatic track record of furry ambassadors.",
      "Still, in an era of rising global tensions, \u201cI think pandas are a really useful entryway,\u201d said James Carter, a China historian at Saint Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia. \u201cPandas open up an opportunity for people to think something positive about China \u2014 they\u2019re cute, they don\u2019t do anything bad.\u201d",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

      "Bordered by the Colorado River to the east, the Salton Sea to the northwest and Mexico to the south, the Imperial Valley is home to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and produces billions of dollars in agricultural production. It grows two-thirds of winter vegetables consumed nationally and provides thousands of jobs. From 2023 to 2024 alone, about 17,579 migrant and seasonal farmworkers were employed in Imperial County, according to the state.",
      "It's also extremely hot. In a given year, there are about 123 days with temperatures over 95 F (35 C), often exceeding 110 F (43 C) in August and early September, according to calculations by Sagar Parajuli, research scientist and adjunct faculty with SDSU's geography department. The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",
      "Some of their data analysis has already been published.",
      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern because an elevated nighttime temperature restricts the ability of farmworkers to cool down,\u201d said Parajuli, the study's lead author. \u201cSo they can\u2019t recover from the heat stress they could be accumulating from the daytime.\"",
      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realized that farmworkers are not getting enough rest breaks, and also there are no clear policy guidelines in terms of heat-related rest breaks,\" he said.",
      "Lopez-Galvez said they plan to continue their research in California's Central Valley and hope to expand it into Yuma, Ariz. and other parts of the Southwest.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Friday said Meta and TitTok had breached their transparency obligations after an investigation that could result in billions of dollars in fines.",
      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content. That led to a kind of obfuscation, with the Commission saying it was \u201cconfusing and dissuading\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be ineffective.\u201d",

TikTok said Friday that it would review the findings but said that the transparency obligations of the DSA conflict with the EU's strict privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation. \"If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\u201d said Paolo Ganino, a spokesperson for TikTok.",

      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason this is such an important line of coverage for Politico right now is it gives readers as close to an unfiltered look at the way powerful people think and express themselves in private as they're going to get,\u201d said Alex Burns, its senior executive editor.",
      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",
      "It reminds Sarah Kreps, a Cornell University professor who teaches about the intersection of politics and technology, of politicians whose careers are ruined by affairs. Everyone sees the cautionary tales, but it doesn't stop the behavior.",
      "\u201cThere's this overconfidence \u2014 \u2018it can\u2019t happen to me. It happens to other people and it won't bring me down,'\u201d Kreps said.",
      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",

Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",

      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",

      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

      "\u201cWhen you talk about something sad, you can see Mico\u2019s face change. You can see it dance around and move as it gets excited with you,\u201d said Jacob Andreou, corporate vice president of product and growth for Microsoft AI, in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s in this effort of really landing this AI companion that you can really feel.\u201d",
      "In the U.S. only so far, Copilot users on laptops and phone apps can speak to Mico, which changes colors and wears glasses when in \u201cstudy\u201d mode.

      "Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online chess last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year. But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",

If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",
      "There are plenty of options for all budget ranges, but I'm partial to lights that you can clip onto jackets or costumes to keep your hands free.",

      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",

      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",

      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",

      "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky has died at the age of 29",
      "Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old standard-bearer in the world of competitive speed chess that flourished in the COVID-19 pandemic, died over the weekend and leaves behind a legacy as one of the greats of the game who helped usher in its digital era.",
      "The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build.",
      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",
      "The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "\u201cDanya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all \u2014 a kind, compassionate and truly good person,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation.",
      "The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the \u201cheroes\u201d he looked up to as a kid.",
      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause.",

He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players.",
      "\u201cDaniel was an incredible teacher and explainer of chess and concepts and ideas,\u201d said Daniel Weissbarth, a renowned chess instructor and the co-owner of Silver Knights Chess Academy in Virginia.",
      "Many pros this week called for an end to the constant finger-pointing that seemed to follow players like Naroditsky who thrived in fast-paced play.",
      "Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive.",
      "\u201cThe rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,\u201d Regan said. \u201cFrom my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.\u201d",
      "The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d At the time, the platform warned of \u201cKramnik\u2019s escalating attacks\u201d against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents.",
      "The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system.",

      "Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was \u201cback, better than ever\u201d after a short \u201ccreative break.\u201d His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State.",

      "Carlsen credited Naroditsky for his work in the streaming space, saying he was \u201csuch a resource to the chess community.\u201d",

      "Netflix missed the earnings target set by stock market analysts during the video streamer\u2019s latest quarter, a letdown that the company blamed on a tax dispute in Brazil.",
      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",
      "Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.",
      "The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix\u2019s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains are about to evaporate.",
      "Although Netflix no longer reveals the specific, this year\u2019s revenue growth signals that its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of last year \u2013 by far the most among video streamers, even as rivals with deeper pockets such as Amazon and Apple expand their programming selections.",

Discovery announcing it may sell all or part of its holdings, which include HBO, DC Studios and CNN.

Discovery's properties other than cable TV networks like CNN and TBS. \u201cWe can be and will be choosey,\u201d Sarandos said.",

      "Centuries-old private libraries are bringing modern comfort and awe to book lovers and history buffs in New England",
      "BOSTON -- When David Arsenault takes down a worn, leather-bound 19th-century book from the winding shelves of the Boston Athenaeum, he feels a sense of awe \u2014 like he\u2019s handling an artifact in a museum.",
      "Many of the half a million books that line the library's seemingly endless maze of reading room shelves and stacks were printed before his great-great-grandparents were born. Among fraying copies of Charles Dickens novels, Civil War-era biographies and town genealogies, everything has a history and a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cIt almost feels like you shouldn\u2019t be able to take the books out of the building, it feels so special,\u201d said Arsenault, who visits the institution adjacent to Boston Common a few times a week. \u201cYou do feel like, and in a lot of ways, you are, in a museum \u2014 but it\u2019s a museum you get to not feel like you\u2019re a visitor in all the time, but really a part of.\u201d",
      "The more than 200-year-old institution is one of only about 20 member-supported private libraries in the U.S. dating back to the 18th- and 19th-centuries. Called athenaeums, a Greek word meaning \u201ctemple of Athena,\u201d the concept predates the traditional public library most Americans recognize today. The institutions were built by merchants, doctors, writers, lawyers and ministers who wanted to not only create institutions for reading \u2014 then an expensive and difficult-to-access hobby \u2014 but also space to explore culture and debate.",
      "Many of these athenaeums still play a vibrant role in their communities.",
      "Patrons gather to play games, join discussions on James Joyce, or even research family history. Others visit to explore some of the nation\u2019s most prized artifacts, such as the largest collection from George Washington \u2019s personal library at Mount Vernon at the Boston Athenaeum.",
      "In addition to conservation work, institutions acquire and uplift the work of more modern creatives who may have been overlooked. The Boston Athenaeum recently co-debuted an exhibit by painter Allan Rohan Crite, who died in 2007 and used his canvas to depict the joy of Black life in the city.",
      "One thing binds all athenaeums together: books and people who love them.",
      "\u201cThe whole institution is built around housing the books,\u201d said Matt Burriesci, executive director of Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island. \u201cThe people who come to this institution really appreciate just holding a book in their hands and reading it the old-fashioned way.\u201d",
      "Built to mimic an imposing Greek temple, staffers at the Providence Athenaeum often talk about the joy of watching people enter for the first time.",
      "Visitors must climb a series of cold, granite steps. Only then are they met with a thick wooden door that ushers them into a warm world filled with cozy reading nooks, hidden desks to leave secret messages to fellow patrons, and almost every square inch bursting with books.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the actual time capsule of people\u2019s reading habits over 200 years,\u201d Burriesci said, while pointing to a first-edition of Little Women, where the pages and spine proudly showcase years of being well read.",
      "Many athenaeums are designed to pay tribute to Greek influence and their namesake, the goddess of wisdom. In Boston, a city once dubbed \u201cthe Athens of America,\u201d visitors to the athenaeum are greeted by a nearly 7-foot-tall (2.1-meter-tall) bronze statue of Athena Giustiniani.",

      "The 12-level building includes five gallery floors where ornate busts of writers and historical figures decorate reading rooms with wooden tables overlooked by book-lined pathways reachable by spiral and hidden staircases.",
      "Natural light shines in from large windows where guests can look down to see one of Boston's most historic cemeteries where figures like Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock are buried.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to leave many of these things out for people to peruse, and I think people can often get curious about something and just follow their curiosity into things that they didn\u2019t even know that they were going to be fascinated by,\u201d said Boston Athenaeum executive director Leah Rosovsky.",
      "When athenaeums were founded, they were exclusive spaces that only people with education and money could access.",
      "Some are now free. Most are open to the public for day passes and tours. Memberships to the Boston Athenaeum can range from $17 to $42 a month per person, depending on whether the patron is under 40 or is sharing the membership with family members.",
      "Charlie Grantham, a wedding photographer and aspiring novelist, said she first visited during one of the institution\u2019s annual community days, where the public can explore for free. She said she was surprised by how accessible it was and describes the space as \u201cBoston\u2019s best kept secret \u2014 an oasis in the middle of the city.\u201d",

      "Some people visit every day to work remotely, read or socialize, said Salem Athenaeum executive director Jean Marie Procious.",
      "\u201cWe do have a loneliness crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want to encourage people to come and see us as a space to meet up with others and a safe environment that you\u2019re not expected to buy a drink or buy a meal.\u201d",

      "More anti-abortion pregnancy centers have been offering medical services such as testing for sexually transmitted infections",
      "Pregnancy centers in the U.S. that discourage women from getting abortions have been adding more medical services \u2014 and could be poised to expand further.",
      "The expansion \u2014 ranging from testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections to even providing primary medical care \u2014 has been unfolding for years. It gained steam after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, clearing the way for states to ban abortion.",
      "The push could get more momentum with Planned Parenthood closing some clinics and considering shuttering others following changes to Medicaid. Planned Parenthood is not just the nation's largest abortion provider, but also offers cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and other reproductive health services.",
      "\u201cWe ultimately want to replace Planned Parenthood with the services we offer,\u201d said Heather Lawless, founder and director of Reliance Center in Lewiston, Idaho. She said about 40% of patients at the anti-abortion center are there for reasons unrelated to pregnancy, including some who use the nurse practitioner as a primary caregiver.",
      "The changes have frustrated abortion-rights groups, who, in addition to opposing the centers' anti-abortion messaging, say they lack accountability; refuse to provide birth control; and most offer only limited ultrasounds that cannot be used for diagnosing fetal anomalies because the people conducting them don't have that training. A growing number also offer unproven abortion-pill reversal treatments.",
      "Because most of the centers don't accept insurance, the federal law restricting release of medical information doesn't apply to them, though some say they follow it anyway. They also don't have to follow standards required by Medicaid or private insurers, though those offering certain services generally must have medical directors who comply with state licensing requirements.",
      "\u201cThere are really bedrock questions,\u201d said Jennifer McKenna, a senior adviser for Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, a project funded by liberal policy organizations that researches the pregnancy centers, \u201cabout whether this industry has the clinical infrastructure to provide the medical services it\u2019s currently advertising.\u201d",
      "Perhaps best known as \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d these mostly privately funded and religiously affiliated centers were expanding services such as diaper banks ahead of the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.",
      "As abortion bans kicked in, the centers expanded medical, educational and other programs, said Moira Gaul, a scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of SBA Pro-Life America. \u201cThey are prepared to serve their communities for the long-term,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In Sacramento, California, for instance, Alternatives Pregnancy Center in the last two years has added family practice doctors, a radiologist and a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, along with nurses and medical assistants. Alternatives \u2014 an affiliate of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of pregnancy centers in the U.S \u2014 is some patients' only health provider.",
      "When The Associated Press asked to interview a patient who had received only non-pregnancy services, the clinic provided Jessica Rose, a 31-year-old woman who took the rare step of detransitioning after spending seven years living as a man, during which she received hormone therapy and a double mastectomy.",
      "For the last two years, she\u2019s received all medical care at Alternatives, which has an OB-GYN who specializes in hormone therapy. Few, if any, pregnancy centers advertise that they provide help with detransitioning. Alternatives has treated four similar patients over the past year, though that's not its main mission, director Heidi Matzke said.",
      "\u201cAPC provided me a space that aligned with my beliefs as well as seeing me as a woman,\u201d Rose said. She said other clinics \"were trying to make me think that detransitioning wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do.\u201d",
      "As of 2024, more than 2,600 anti-abortion pregnancy centers operated in the U.S., up 87 from 2023, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project led by University of Georgia public health researchers who are concerned about aspects of the centers. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 765 clinics offered abortions last year, down more than 40 from 2023.",
      "Over the years, pregnancy centers have received a boost in taxpayer funds. Nearly 20 states, largely Republican-led, now funnel millions of public dollars to these organizations. Texas alone sent $70 million to pregnancy centers this fiscal year, while Florida dedicated more than $29 million for its \u201cPregnancy Support Services Program\u201d",
      "This boost in resources is unfolding as Republicans have barred Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds under the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. While federal law already blocked the use of taxpayer funds for most abortions, Medicaid reimbursements for other health services were a big part of Planned Parenthood's revenue.",

      "The allegations of fraud appeared to be motivated by the defendants' desire to make money and keep their jobs and was not an effort to influence the election results, said Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican.",
      "Guillermo Sainz, 33, described by prosecutors as the director of a company's registration drives in Pennsylvania, was charged with three counts of solicitation of registration, a state law that prohibits offering money to reach registration quotas. A message seeking comment was left on a number associated with Sainz, who lives in Arizona. He did not have a lawyer listed in court records.",
      "The six canvassers are charged with unsworn falsification, tampering with public records, forgery and violations of Pennsylvania election law. The charges relate to activities in three Republican-leaning Pennsylvania counties: York, Lancaster and Berks.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,\u201d Sunday said in a news release. Prosecutors said the forms included all party affiliations.",
      "In a court affidavit filed with the criminal charges on Friday, investigators said Sainz, an employee of Field+Media Corps, \"instituted unlawful financial incentives and pressures in his push to meet company goals to maintain funding which in turn spurred some canvassers to create and submit fake forms to earn more money.\"",
      "The chief executive of Field+Media Corps, based in Mesa, Arizona, said last year the company was proud of its work to expand voting but had no information about problematic registration forms. A message seeking comment was left Friday for the CEO, Francisco Heredia. The Field+Media Corps website did not appear to be operative.",

Another told investigators that most of the registration forms he collected were \u201cnot real.\u201d A third reported that when she realized she was not going to reach a daily quota, \u201cshe would make up names and information,\u201d police wrote, \u201cdue to fear of losing her job.\u201d",

At a campaign event, he declared there was \u201ccheating\u201d involving \u201c2,600\u201d votes.

      "BALTIMORE -- The U.S. government plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia, and could do so as early as Oct. 31, according to a Friday court filing.",
      "The Salvadoran national's case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.",
      "Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.",
      "A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that \u201cLiberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States\u2019s closest partners on the African continent.\u201d Its national language is English; its constitution \u201cprovides robust protections for human rights;\u201d and Liberia is \u201ccommitted to the humane treatment of refugees,\u201d the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.",
      "\u201cAfter failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,\u201d a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. \u201cCosta Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of violence from a gang that targeted his family, according to court filings. In a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the United States.",

      "Statues of Rosa Parks and Helen Keller were unveiled Friday on the grounds of the Alabama Capitol",
      "Statues of Rosa Parks and Helen Keller, pivotal figures who fought for justice and inspired change across the world, were unveiled Friday on the grounds of the Alabama Capitol.",
      "The monuments honoring the Alabama natives whose advocacy helped dismantle racial segregation and promoted the rights of people with disabilities are the first statues of women to be installed on the lawn of the Alabama Capitol, broadening the history reflected on the grounds that also include tributes to the Confederacy, which was formed at the site in 1861.",
      "Gov. Kay Ivey, currently the nation's longest serving female governor, said Parks and Keller \u201crose to shape history through quiet strength and unwavering conviction.\u201d",
      "\u201cCourage changes the course of history, and today, these statutes stand as symbols of that courage \u2014 testaments to what one person, especially one determined one, can do to make the world a better place,\u201d Ivey said.",
      "Known as the mother of the Civil Rights Movement, Parks was arrested on Dec. 1, 1955, when she refused to leave her bus seat for a white passenger. While Parks was not the first woman arrested for defying bus segregation laws, her arrest became the catalyst for the yearlong boycott by Black passengers and helped usher in change nationwide.",
      "Born in 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama, Keller became deaf and blind after a serious illness before her second birthday. Her tutor, Anne Sullivan, taught her to communicate through sign language and Braille, and she became a well-known writer and lecturer who championed the rights of workers, poor people, women and people with disabilities.",
      "The statue of Parks, themed as \"a step into equality,\" shows her as if boarding a bus, just across the Capitol steps from a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, a fitting location for an icon who showed \"how to fight against racial segregation and inequality in a non violent way,\u201d the Rev. Agnes M. Lover said.",
      "Parks appears to peer down Dexter Avenue. That's the street where she boarded the bus that history-making day, and also the site of slave markets in the 1800s as well as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dexter Avenue Church, where mass meetings were held to organize the bus boycott.",
      "Park's statue looks over the grounds where a huge crowd formed at the end of the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery. That her monument is also just a stone's throw from Davis, who helped tear the nation apart trying to preserve slavery \u2014 is likely to raise some eyebrows.",
      "The removal of memorials to Confederate figures like Davis was a key goal of the wave of activism that followed the 2015 slaughtering of nine Black church parishioners by a white supremacist gunman who idolized Confederate symbols. More than 480 symbols and statues were removed nationwide since then, according to the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201cWhose Heritage?\u201d campaign.",
      "But Alabama forbids the removal of longstanding monuments, and while few cities, such as Birmingham, have defied that law, the Davis statue remains.",

      "Doris Brown\u2019s home in Northeast Houston becomes a refuge for neighbors during power outages thanks to her solar panel and battery system",
      "HOUSTON -- Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. \u201cThere were no lights, nowhere,\u201d said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. \u201cI didn't even know it.\u201d",
      "Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. \u201cCall everybody,\u201d she told the neighbor.",
      "Soon around 15 \u201cneighbors and neighbors' neighbors\u201d were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over.",
      "\u201cThere were people sleeping everywhere,\u201d said Brown, 75. She was happy to be \u201ca port in a storm,\u201d despite one downside: \u201cThey ate all my snacks.\u201d",
      "Brown's house is a \u201chub home,\u201d one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens \u2014 not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses.",
      "The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s us helping us,\u201d said Brown.",
      "The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation.",
      "People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional \u2014 requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center.",
      "But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.",
      "\u201cIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,\u201d said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.",
      "The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.",
      "Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Shoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for\u2019,\u201d said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.",
      "WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up.",
      "WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.",
      "When the D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.",
      "The pilot had its challenges \u2014 some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them.",
      "Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.",
      "\u201cYou have to build that trust,\u201d said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery\u2019s co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. \u201cI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,\u201d he said.",
      "About a dozen people are signed up on Espinoza's \u201croster,\u201d but he said the hub is there for anyone in need, prioritizing older neighbors and those with children or medical conditions.",

      "President Donald Trump will be in Japan and South Korea next week and he's expected to promote an epic windfall in investments for U.S. factories and projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is going to Japan and South Korea next week to promote an epic financial windfall \u2014 at least $900 billion in investments for U.S. factories, a natural gas pipeline and other projects.",
      "Japan and South Korea made those financial commitments in August to try to get Trump to ratchet down his planned tariff rates from 25% to 15%. But as the U.S. president is set to depart Friday night for Asia, the pledges are more of a loose end than money in the bank for American industry.",
      "Japan pledged $550 billion in investments, but it wants the money to benefit its own companies, making that a condition in a memorandum released in September. As of Monday, Japan has a new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, who has expressed respect for Trump but is operating in an untested coalition government.",
      "South Korea offered $350 billion \u2014 but wants a swap line for U.S. dollars to facilitate its investments and seeks to fund the transactions through loan guarantees. Otherwise, the commitment could sink its own economy.",
      "The investment arrangements are unusual for trade frameworks, and Trump maintains that he will personally direct how the money is spent, enabling him to pick winners and losers. Weeks of talks have yet to produce any breakthroughs on how the investments would go forward even though both nations want to preserve their relationship with America.",
      "Still, ahead of the trip, Trump was radiating optimism that his tariffs had forced investments to fuel what he believes will be an economic boom starting next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done well, as you know, with Japan, with South Korea,\u201d Trump told Republican senators Tuesday. \u201cWithout the tariffs, you could have never made the deal. I\u2019ll tell you what. Tariffs equal national security.\u201d",
      "For Trump, the investments are also about demonstrating America\u2019s strength before a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping while he is in South Korea. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Monday described Trump's strategy in part as \u201cencouraging allied investment in America\u2019s industrial future\u201d to counter Chinese manufacturers.",
      "But Japan and South Korea are also competing against China \u2014 which is pivoting aggressively into electric vehicles, computer chips and other technologies. There is a risk that mandating investment in the U.S. could weaken allies that are closer geographically to China, said Christopher Smart, managing partner at the Arbroath Group, a geopolitical strategy firm.",
      "\u201cThey need to invest in their own countries,\u201d said Smart, who was a senior economic aide in the Obama White House. He said Trump was \u201cgoing to extract investment money\u201d from the countries while also erecting \"tariff walls\u201d that could make it harder for them to sell goods in America, a rather lopsided view of how alliances work.",
      "Few experts believe Japan and South Korea would agree with the Trump administration's framing that their U.S. investments are a way to compete against China.",
      "\u201cIt is really about lowering tariffs and avoiding Trump\u2019s wrath,\u201d said Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center for Asia Policy Studies.",
      "There is an expectation that Japan and South Korea both want to resolve any hurdles on the investments and will take steps to achieve \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with Trump, said William Chou, a senior fellow focused on Japan at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank.",
      "Chou pointed to Nippon Steel's agreement to purchase U.S. Steel this year as an example of how Japan can work with the Trump administration. The president had initially opposed the merger, but later backed it with an agreement that gave the U.S. government some control over the acquired company.",
      "Similarly, the memorandum of understanding on Japan\u2019s $550 million investment would also give the U.S. government input on how the money would be spent. It provides for a committee led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to propose investments, giving Japan 45 days to respond, with the understanding that the deals would give preference to Japanese contractors and suppliers.",

      "Jonathan Rinderknecht appeared in federal court Thursday afternoon after arriving in Los Angeles from Florida earlier in the day, his attorney Steve Haney said. A judge ordered that he remain in custody ahead of his trial.",
      "Federal officials said Rinderknecht, who lived in the area, started a small fire on New Year\u2019s Day that smoldered underground before reigniting nearly a week later and roaring through Pacific Palisades, home to many of Los Angeles\u2019 rich and famous.",
      "The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods across Pacific Palisades and Malibu, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.",

      "A week later, a grand jury indicted him on additional charges including one count of arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, and one count of timber set afire. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Rinderknecht\u2019s trial is set for December 16.",
      "On Thursday, he appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Rozella Oliver wearing a white jumpsuit. His attorney argued that he should be released on bail, based on the evaluation of court officials in Florida.",

      "Rinderknecht made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint. Federal officials called the Palisades blaze a \u201choldover fire\u201d from the Jan. 1 fire, which was not fully extinguished by firefighters, the complaint said.",
      "The city\u2019s interim fire chief said such fires linger in root systems and can reach depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to over 6 meters), making them undetectable by thermal imaging cameras.",

      "In his new book, \"The Running Ground: A Father, a Son, and the Simplest of Sports\" (to be published Oct. 28 by Random House), tech journalist and CEO of The Atlantic Nicholas Thompson explores his passion for running, the simplicity of the sport, and how it has changed his sense of self.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Nicholas Thompson on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"The Running Ground\" by Nicholas Thompson",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Running is the simplest of sports: right foot, left foot, right foot. There's no ball to focus on, no mat to land on, no one charging toward you with their shoulder down. But the simplicity opens up complexity. As you run, your attention shifts inward. You're just you \u2014 right foot, left foot, and whatever goes on in your mind.",
      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",
      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",

      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 15:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and appeared to blame stress. Doctors say stress isn't usually a direct cause, but can influence risk factors.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:53:28 -0400",
    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Misty Copeland reflects on her decision to step away from the American Ballet Theatre.",
    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",
      "Copeland said the timing of her departure was important.",
      "\"I always said to myself, like, I'm not gonna be that ballerina that they're pulling off by the pointe shoes, like, 'Girl, it's time.' You know, that I wanna be able to say, you know, like, I feel good in this moment, and now is time for me to bow,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 17:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.",
    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "Ace Frehley (April 27, 1951-Oct. 16, 2025) was a founding member and lead guitarist of the rock band Kiss, whose theatrical makeup, costumes and stagecraft made them a leading proponent of glam rock in the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Born Paul Daniel Frehley into a musical family, he played guitar since age 13, and performed with bands around New York City. At 18 he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix.",
      "In 1973 Frehley joined with singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss to form Kiss. Their earliest albums did not sell well, but their stage antics \u2014 replete with pyrotechnics and stage blood, and guitars that emitted smoke during solos \u2014 earned them a following. By 1976 their albums \"Destroyer\" and \"Rock and Roll Over\" went platinum, and 1977's \"Love Gun\" hit #4 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Frehley frequently feuded with fellow band members Stanley and Simmons, and left Kiss in 1982.",
      "He performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley's Comet, before rejoining Kiss in the mid-1990s, reclaiming his persona of \"The Spaceman,\" or \"Space Ace.\" He stayed until 2002, when he resumed recording solo and with Frehley's Comet.",
      "The original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "In 2024 Frehley told Guitar World magazine, \"I'm always flattered when people tell me I influenced them. If I knew I was going to influence thousands of guitar players, I would have practiced more!\u00a0 I laugh, but that's the truth. \u2026 I've had so many players come up to me and say, 'You are the reason I play guitar,' and I'm always like, 'Wow.'\""

      "In his memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Oct. 21 by Grand Central), actor Tim Curry, renowned for such fan favorites as \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"Clue,\" writes of a multitude of journeys in his life pursuing various channels of creative expression (often in the guise of an irresistible villain), and of the 2012 stroke that nearly ended this vagabond's adventures.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Ben Mankiewicz's interview with Tim Curry on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 19!",
      "\"Vagabond: A Memoir\" by Tim Curry",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",

      "The increase represents an uptick from the last year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, which set the 2025 increase at 2.5%. Inflation has edged higher this year. The Labor Department said Friday that the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of U.S. inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3% in September.",

People who receive Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income and disabled people, will see their first COLA increase with their Dec. 31, 2025 check, the agency said.",
      "The annual COLA is designed to ensure that seniors, disabled Americans and other Social Security beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power to inflation. Even so, a recent poll by the AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found that many seniors think the retirement program's inflation adjustments are falling short and that they need an annual COLA of about 5% to keep up with their daily expenses.",
      "\"The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is one of the few inflation-adjusted programs for retirees,\" Jenn Jones, AARP's vice president of government affairs, told CBS News. \"It is incredibly important to millions of Americans, and so although it may not feel like it's quite enough, especially after the last few years, it's critically helpful for keeping pace with rising costs.\"",
      "In a statement, Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said the cost-of-living adjustment \"is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.\"",
      "How SSA calculates its annual COLA",
      "The Social Security Administration announces the COLA each fall based on a metric known as the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,\" or\u00a0CPI-W, which tracks the average change in prices paid by workers for a basket of commonly bought goods and services.",
      "The COLA is based on that inflation data from July through September.",
      "Some advocates for older Americans say the CPI-W fails to accurately reflect seniors' financial needs because it tracks younger workers, while retirees tend to face higher costs for health care, housing and some other items. Seniors on Medicare, the health insurance program for those over 65, spend 13.6% of their income on health-related expenses, more than double that of younger people, according to KFF.",
      "Meanwhile, poverty is on the rise among America's seniors, with the poverty rate among seniors rising to 15% last year, up from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to recent Census data. The AARP said more older adults are struggling with the rising cost of housing and utility costs.",
      "\"Most Social Security beneficiaries aren't working \u2014 you are on a fixed income, so any inflation increase you feel,\" Jones said. \"If the increases continue, it becomes difficult to figure out how you're going to pay for all of your monthly expenses.\"",
      "How Medicare costs could impact benefits",
      "Advocates for senior citizens say the COLA is likely to fall short, especially given forecasts for increases in Medicare's premiums and deductibles for 2026. The Medicare premium is taken directly from seniors' Social Security checks.",
      "While Medicare hasn't yet announced its 2026 premiums, its trustees report issued earlier this year projected that the standard monthly premium for Part B \u2014 which covers doctors visits and outpatient care \u2014 would likely rise to $206.50, or a 12% boost from its current rate. Deductibles are also projected to rise about 12% next year, the report said.",
      "The result: Seniors could see most of their 2026 COLA eaten up by higher Medicare costs, the National Council on Aging said in a statement.",
      "\"COLA might reflect the inflation rate, but it is woefully insufficient for older Americans who already have high health care costs and are facing even greater increases in their Medicare costs in 2026,\" Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the NCA, said in the statement.",
      "Seniors are likely to be disappointed by the 2026 COLA, which represents the second-smallest bump since 2021. Many are at risk of falling behind, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group.",
      "The Consumer Price Index for September, also released on Friday, showed that medical and elderly care costs are surpassing the 3% annualized pace of inflation. Costs for caring for the elderly at home jumped 11.6% last month on an annual basis, while medical services rose 3.9%.",
      "\"Seniors on fixed incomes are rightly concerned that the Social Security COLA is not keeping pace with the true impact of inflation on their living costs, especially in areas where prices are soaring.\u00a0 Medical, housing and grocery costs are outstripping the COLA,\" Max Richtman, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",

Because of the stalemate in Congress, now in its 24th day, Hornick also has no clue on when the next paycheck will arrive.",
      "\"It's very annoying that employees who are furloughed can collect unemployment, but employees who are essential and have to work without pay cannot collect unemployment,\" Hornick told CBS News. \"And yet I am showing up on my own dime because we still have to pay money to put gas in the car, pay the daycare center, because they are not going to take kids for free.\"",

      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:34:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

The plea was part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement Binance reached with the Biden-era Justice Department in 2023, and Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO.",

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 12,000 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

      "\"If you have a controller that's working six days a week, but has to think about, 'How am I going to pay the mortgage, how am I going to make the car payment, how am I going to put food on my kids' table,' they have to make choices,\" Duffy said at the\u00a0House GOP's press conference\u00a0at the Capitol. \"And the choices they are making is to take a second job.\"",
      "Duffy's statement came after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson highlighted that air traffic controllers \u2014 essential government employees who are required to work without pay during the lapse in funding \u2014 are working long shifts in towers and centers, then \"hopping in a car and driving for Uber or delivering for DoorDash all night.\"",
      "The transportation secretary discouraged air traffic controllers from seeking additional employment on top of an already demanding, high-stress job.",
      "\"Well, I don't want my air traffic controllers to take a second job \u2014 I want them to do one job. I don't want them delivering for DoorDash, I don't want them driving Uber. I want them coming to their facilities, and controlling the air space,\" Duffy said, while acknowledging the financial pressures they are under to \"put food on their table, feed their kids and support their family members.\"",
      "Duffy also said he \"can't guarantee\" that passengers' flights will take off on time or that they won't be canceled as the second-longest government shutdown in U.S. history drags on.",
      "Johnson said that 19,000 flights were delayed across the U.S. from Saturday to Monday, citing data from flight tracking website FlightAware. Another 1,600 flights were canceled over the same period.",
      "Duffy explained that sporadic air traffic controller staffing shortages could lead to flight delays and cancellations, with the department deliberately slowing down flight traffic to ensure that passengers remain safe.",
      "\"It's not moving as many flights as possible, it's moving as many flights as possible safely,\" Duffy said. \"And if we can't do that, you'll see the flights come down. You'll see the delays, you'll see the cancellations.\"",
      "Flight delays and cancellations are mounting\u00a0as the U.S. enters the busy holiday travel season, with Thanksgiving and Christmas approaching.",

    "summary": "The national debt is rising faster than ever and threatens to undermine confidence in the economy, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, U.S. Treasury Department data shows.",
      "The country's mounting debt comes as the government remains closed, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.",
      "Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",
      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The federal deficit is the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue, while the debt is the total amount it owes over time.",
      "The U.S. debt reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",
      "Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said.",
      "Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\"",
      "Impact on consumers",
      "Over time, rising debt hurts consumers by driving up inflation, Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"I think a lot of people want to know that their kids and grandkids are going to be in good, decent shape in the future \u2014 that they will be able to afford a house,\" said Smetters, who served in President George W. Bush's Treasury Department. \"That additional inflation compounds\" and erodes consumers' purchasing power.",
      "The Trump administration says its efforts to curb government spending will put the country on a better fiscal trajectory. From April to September, the nation's total deficit totaled $468 billion, according to Treasury Department data. In a social media post on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that's the lowest reading since 2019.",
      "\"During his first eight months in office, President Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024 by cutting spending and boosting revenue,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, adding that the administration is working to boost economic growth, lower inflation, and reduce waste and fraud in government spending.",

    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:15:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:09:54 -0400",
    "summary": "New visa fee for highly skilled foreign workers only applies to new applicants currently living abroad, according to fresh guidance from U.S. immigration agency.",
    "story": [
      "Guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clarifies that a $100,000 fee imposed in September to obtain H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers applies only to new applicants who are living abroad.",
      "In a notice\u00a0posted\u00a0on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said.",
      "The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 \"requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\"",
      "The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.",
      "Importantly for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to move from one type of visa to another, such as from an F-1 visa for non-U.S. students to H-1B status.",
      "The White House had previously said the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, with exemptions for some specialized workers who do not \"pose a threat to the security or welfare\" of the U.S.",
      "In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary \"to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.\" He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "The Trump administration has said the $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will compel U.S. companies to hire Americans, instead of relying on labor from overseas. Many economists, however, expect mixed results.",
      "In the short term, some U.S. technology workers could see their job prospects improve, as employers turn away from foreign labor because of the hefty fee attached. Other research, however, such as a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment, from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics, found that H-1B workers actually \"help firms increase their employment,\" and that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains, which includes domestic hires.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration over the foreign worker visa fee, calling it unlawful. It was the second complaint to be filed challenging the fee, with a coalition of health care groups and labor unions also challenging the policy's legality in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in October.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 08:41:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imports are boosting consumer prices in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion.",

    "summary": "The French government will not be reimbursed for any losses related to the priceless jewels, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The priceless jewels thieves stole from the Louvre museum in a brazen heist this week were not privately insured, France's Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper\u00a0Le Parisien.",
      "French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",
      "Because the Louvre is a national museum, its collections are considered state property for which the state alone bears responsibility, according to D\u00e9chelette. The French Ministry of Culture did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "\"Everything that belongs to state museums in France is uninsured, unless it leaves the museum,\" D\u00e9chelette told CBS News.",
      "D\u00e9chelette added that if any of the stolen crown jewels had left the museum for another exhibit, the price of insurance would have been calculated based on an estimated value.",
      "\"There is necessarily a value in the government accounts, and an estimate would be assigned with commissions and experts,\" he explained.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, who is investigating the incident, said Tuesday that the stolen crown jewels are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, according to the Associated Press. That estimate doesn't account for their historical value to France",
      "Prosecutor , whose office is leading the investigation, said about 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the suspects and gems after Sunday's theft from the world's most-visited museum.",
      "Charlie Horrell, head of fine art at insurance broker Marsh, told CBS News that private insurance would cover the cost of any losses that were to occur during transit.",
      "\"It's generally somebody dropping a painting, and we'd cover the repair and restoration cost of that painting, plus the depreciation of that piece,\" he told CBS News.",
      "In the case of the Louvre robbery, were the pieces to be insured privately, \"there's no question that if cover were in place, that claim would be paid out without issue,\" he said.",
      "The French law does not apply to collections housed in private museums, like the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris. \"In that case it's different, and they buy insurance,\" D\u00e9chelette said.",
      "\"The state is its own insurer as long as the works belonging to national museums remain in their usual place of storage,\" a spokesperson for the Ministry of Culture said in a statement to Le Parisien.",
      "As a result, neither the museum nor the government will receive any private insurance payments to cover the value of the stolen objects, according to D\u00e9chelette.",
      "While French authorities are likely to locate the robbery suspects, they may not ever recover the stolen national treasures, a criminologist told CBS News.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News. \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "While the missing French crown jewels are widely considered to be priceless based on their historical value, they could be broken up into pieces, with the gems sold for millions on the black market, experts have told CBS News.",
      "The heist raises concerns about the national museum's security vulnerabilities. According to a recent security audit, 35% of the rooms in the Denon Wing, where the stolen jewels are displayed, are not monitored by security cameras, Radio France reported.",

    "story": [
      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and different types of jobs, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This data confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "What makes for a good job?",
      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employment",
      "Workplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassment",
      "Growth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their career",
      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

    "story": [
      "A pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News said Christopher Moynihan was arrested Sunday after saying in text messages that he planned to \"eliminate\" Jeffries when the top House Democrat spoke at the Economic Club of New York in New York City on Monday, Oct. 20.",
      "Moynihan was arraigned Tuesday and entered a plea of not guilty. He was released on bond on Saturday, prosecutors told CBS News, pending future court proceedings.",
      "According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.\"",
      "Moynihan also allegedly stated: \"Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future,\" the filing said.",
      "Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Jeffries noted that Moynihan had been pardoned by Mr. Trump on his first day in office and that \"many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country.\" But Jeffries added that \"threats of violence will not stop us from showing up, standing up and speaking up for the American people.\"",
      "Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney.",
      "Dutchess County, New York district attorney Anthony Parisi said in a statement to CBS News that \"although my office was not contacted during the investigative stage of this matter, we are now reviewing the case for legal and factual sufficiency.\"",
      "Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.",
      "Prosecutors described Moynihan as being among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: \"While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'\"",
      "Prosecutors said Moynihan \"occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting,\" and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.",
      "Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.",
      "A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\"",
      "State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.",
      "Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.",
      "Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as \"hostages\" by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of \"raising a firearm at police\" in early 2025 and \"acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol,\" according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump late Friday pushed for several Biden-era Justice Department officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump accused four high-ranking officials \u2014 former Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, special counsel Jack Smith and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco \u2014 of signing off on an FBI probe in which investigators allegedly looked at nine Republican lawmakers' phone records.",
      "\"These Radical Left Lunatics should be prosecuted for their illegal and highly unethical behavior!\" the president wrote. He did not specify what crimes he believes they committed.",
      "The message marks the latest instance of Mr. Trump urging the prosecution of people he has singled out as political foes. Last month, he pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Since then, Comey and James have been criminally indicted.",
      "The GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee revealed earlier this month that the FBI obtained phone data for about eight GOP senators and one GOP representative in 2023 as part of Arctic Frost, an investigation into Mr. Trump and his allies' attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "Earlier this week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the judiciary panel, released documents that appeared to indicate Wray, Garland and Monaco approved the opening of the Arctic Frost probe in the spring of 2022. Later that year, Garland appointed Smith to independently oversee the criminal investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "In Friday's post, Mr. Trump alleged the four former officials \"spied on Senators and Congressmen/women, and even taped their calls\" \u2014 though the Judiciary Committee said in a statement earlier this month the records obtained by the FBI didn't include the content of calls. Instead, the data covered who the lawmakers called and when, and the length of their calls.",
      "The president also claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 they \"cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to representatives for Smith, Garland and Monaco for comment.",
      "Grassley excoriated the FBI over its handling of Arctic Frost earlier this month, calling the revelations about lawmakers' phone records \"disturbing and outrageous\" and part of a pattern of \"weaponization\" that was \"arguably worse than Watergate.\"",
      "Smith's attorneys called his actions \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy\" in a letter to Grassley earlier this week.",
      "The phone records that were scrutinized by the FBI covered several days both before and after Jan. 6, 2021, when Mr. Trump pressed lawmakers to vote against certifying former President Joe Biden's election win. The gambit was unsuccessful as Congress ended up voting to certify, but the process was interrupted by rioting at the Capitol.",
      "Mr. Trump was charged by Smith's team in August 2023 for conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Mr. Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.",
      "Smith's investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking Biden's victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by him and his alleged co-conspirators to reach lawmakers by phone. It argued the president \"attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification.\"",
      "Last year, a final report penned by Smith also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed, one of them widely believed to be Rudy Giuliani.",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at the federal officials who investigated him in the past.",
      "His legal team has asked the Justice Department to pay him about $230 million to settle federal damage claims over two investigations into him, CBS News confirmed this week. Those claims focus on the Trump-Russia probe from his first term and the criminal case against Mr. Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents, which was pursued by Smith.",
      "And a federal watchdog office launched an investigation into Smith for alleged illegal political activity earlier this year. Smith's attorneys called the claims \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",

      "Dozens of executives and companies have donated to fund the construction of President Trump's $300 million ballroom, as many of them eye favorable policy, reduced scrutiny or approval for major deals from the White House.",
      "Donors to the ballroom \u2014 which will take the place of the White House's East Wing \u2014 include Big Tech companies, defense contractors and other large corporations. The White House has not disclosed how much money each company donated. Mr. Trump has said construction will be funded through private donations and his own money \u2014 not taxpayer funds.",
      "Speaking to reporters Friday night as he was departing for an Asia trip, Mr. Trump said that \"more than $350 million\" had been raised so far.",
      "CBS News reviewed a list of 37 donors provided by the White House, which included tech firms like Google and Amazon and crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase. Others that contributed to the project include Nvidia, Susquehanna International Group and ExtremityCare, according to sources familiar with the matter. The president hosted a dinner last week thanking donors, although not everyone invited to the dinner contributed.",
      "Asked for comment on whether these donations present any conflicts, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement to CBS News: \"The same critics who are wrongly claiming there are conflicts of interests, would complain if taxpayers were footing the bill.\"",
      "\"The donors for the White House ballroom project represent a wide array of great American companies and generous individuals, all of whom are contributing to make the People's House better for generations to come,\" she added.",
      "Here's a closer look at what some of the donors and dinner guests stand to gain from federal policy or have already received from the administration.",
      "Big Tech and telecom",
      "Tech giants Google, Palantir, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as cell phone carrier T-Mobile, were among the donors listed by the White House.",
      "YouTube, owned by Google, agreed to pay $22 million toward the ballroom project as part of a legal settlement in a case Mr. Trump brought against the company for temporarily removing him from the platform after the 2021 Capitol riot.",
      "Software company Palantir has been awarded more than $800 million across several government contracts in fiscal year 2025, more than in any prior year, according to federal contract data. The Trump administration has also made Palantir a key player in managing and consolidating data about Americans between federal agencies, The New York Times reported.",
      "Amazon and Microsoft also have each received hundreds of millions in government contracts, federal data show.",
      "T-Mobile may stand to benefit from a Trump Organization-linked mobile phone and cell service company, something House Democrats have expressed conflict-of-interest concerns over. The company isn't run by the Trump Organization, but is licensing the president's name. The Trump Mobile network says it is run on Liberty Mobile Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator that rents bandwidth from major carriers like T-Mobile.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a T-Mobile spokesperson said the company donated to the Trust for the National Mall, which is handling ballroom donations, but has \"no role in the use of those funds or decisions related to the construction of the ballroom.\" The spokesperson did not comment on the Trump-linked cell service company.",
      "Representatives from Nvidia, one of the world's leading developers of advanced microchips, were among dozens of donors invited to Mr. Trump's thank-you dinner, according to a guest list obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration granted Nvidia export licenses to send certain chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenues, as the company's CEO presses for greater access to the Chinese market. Nvidia is also waiting for the administration's full approval to ship hundreds of thousands of its artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates annually, though the administration gave the company permission to export to American businesses operating in the Gulf country earlier this month, according to Bloomberg.",
      "Jeff Yass, who cofounded the trading firm Susquehanna International Group and invested in TikTok, was also on the guest list. Yass has given more than $16 million to super PAC MAGA Inc. this year. In his first term, Mr. Trump sought to ban TikTok, but he reversed course this year, signing an order last month to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. with a slate of American investors. Meanwhile, Yass's wealth has surged by billions of dollars this year, according to estimates by Bloomberg and Forbes.",
      "Cryptocurrency",
      "Some of the biggest names in crypto also made donations to Mr. Trump's ballroom, according to the White House's list of donors. The Trump administration has vowed to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world,\" as the president's family has made billions on their own crypto ventures.",
      "A company spokesman confirmed Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, made a donation. The company is seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval to offer blockchain-based stocks. It also faces an SEC investigation started under former President Joe Biden into whether it misstated its user numbers in past financial disclosures, The New York Times reported. Earlier this year, the SEC withdrew a separate lawsuit against Coinbase, shortly after the company donated $1 million to Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twin brothers who own crypto exchange Gemini, also helped pay for the event space. In February, the SEC closed a long-running investigation into their crypto exchange, Cameron Winklevoss announced on X, after the Winklevoss twins donated more than $2 million to MAGA Inc. one month prior. In July, the brothers successfully lobbied Mr. Trump to withdraw his original nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates crypto, according to Politico.",
      "The crypto company Ripple also donated. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has openly expressed his support for the current administration's cryptocurrency policies, and Mr. Trump has promoted its coin, XRP, as one of the coins that a planned U.S. government-controlled crypto reserve should include.",
      "Defense and federal contractors",
      "Lockheed Martin donated over $10 million to Mr. Trump's ballroom, according to company sources. The defense contractor is typically awarded tens of billions annually in federal contracts.",
      "Booz Allen Hamilton also made a donation to the president's event space. The consulting firm typically generates 98% of its annual revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, but it has suffered from the Trump administration's crackdown on federal spending. Its government contracts shrunk by 20% in the fiscal year 2025, and its stock price has plunged 46% since Mr. Trump's reelection.",
      "Media",
      "Comcast has expressed interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, Bloomberg reported, but its merger would face federal scrutiny. The Department of Justice blocked a Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger in 2015, because it would have made the conglomerate an \"unavoidable gatekeeper\" for Internet-based services. Comcast doesn't historically have the favor of the president; in April on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Comcast, which owns NBC and is spinning off MSNBC, a \"disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting.\"",
      "Medical",
      "Biotech company ExtremityCare's CEOs were on the thank-you dinner guest list. The company, which makes costly human cell and tissue medical products, previously donated $5 million to MAGA Inc.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing to auction offshore oil drilling leases across new portions of the U.S. coast as soon as 2026, according to internal Department of Interior draft documents viewed by CBS News.",
      "New leases would include waters off New England, the Carolinas and California.",
      "Offshore oil leases are common along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, as well as parts of Alaska, but there are currently no active oil leases on the Atlantic coast, and California has not had a new oil lease since 1984.",
      "This comes as the Department of Interior formally\u00a0announced\u00a0plans this week to reopen 1.56 million aces in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden administration decision to limit oil drilling in the Arctic.",
      "That decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who accused the administration of rewarding the fossil fuel industry for its support of the president. \"This decision is not about energy dominance\u2014it's about donor dominance,\" Markey said in a statement. \"The Trump administration must immediately reverse its shortsighted decision. The Arctic Refuge is not for sale.\"",
      "The Department of Interior is\u00a0assessing new oil leases\u00a0as part of the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, which issues oil leases in five-year increments. The Biden administration set the previous plan and had the fewest leases on record, with only three.",
      "Documents reviewed by CBS News included assessments of whether state governments favored offshore drilling, and indicated that the states opposed it. The documents also included potential dates for leasing each tract of seafloor.",
      "If the plan is approved by the Interior secretary and moves forward, California could see lease sales as soon as 2027 and the Beaufort Sea in Alaska, which includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could see lease sales as early as 2026. Under the terms of the lease, a company would then have five to 10 years, depending on the water depth in the area, to explore and develop oil and gas production.",
      "The Trump administration opened\u00a0a public comment period in April\u00a0for a new five-year gas leasing policy. Lawmakers from both parties voiced concerns about offshore drilling, including members of Congress and state governors, and the process drew more than 34,000 comments.",
      "Governors Josh Stein (D, North Carolina) and Henry McMaster (R, South Carolina),\u00a0issued a joint statement\u00a0opposing the idea, saying there has been broad bipartisan consensus against offshore drilling because of, \"the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states.\"",
      "In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June, McMaster\u00a0wrote, \"Every coastal municipality in South Carolina has passed a resolution opposing oil and gas exploration activities offshore. I stand firmly with them. We simply cannot afford to accept the risk of the adverse environmental impact attendant to offshore drilling.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to McMaster for comment, but his office did not respond.",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican who is running for governor of South Carolina, issued a\u00a0similar letter\u00a0to Burgum, writing, \"In South Carolina, there is widespread bipartisan agreement in opposing offshore drilling off the coast of our state.\"",
      "The Trump administration tried to open new offshore oil leases during his first term, but backtracked when Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina lawmakers from both parties criticized the effort. The Trump administration instituted bans on offshore drilling in waters surrounding those states shortly before the 2020 election. The current iteration of the plan does not include offshore oil leases off Florida's coast, but it is unclear whether those bans will continue off the Carolinas.",
      "CBS News reached out to the White House and Department of Interior for more information about the plans. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing policy discussions.",
      "The Biden administration issued a record low number of offshore oil leases, and withdrew 625 million acres along the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaska coasts from offshore oil development. The Trump administration rescinded those Biden withdrawals, and a federal court in Louisiana ruled this month that the Biden withdrawals were illegal.",
      "Offshore oil leases have been unpopular for decades. Congress had a moratorium preventing drilling on both coasts and the eastern Gulf from 1981 to 2008, and President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order preventing offshore drilling which stood until 2008, when his son\u00a0lifted the order.",
      "The Obama administration had once considered opening the Atlantic coast to offshore oil leases but changed its stance following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf.",
      "The Department of Interior is expected to publish its first proposal on the subject in the coming weeks. There will be two additional comment periods before a final plan is proposed and implemented.",

      "The pair of legal filings came the evening before James is set to be arraigned Friday in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Prosecutors allege that James bought a house in Virginia and agreed to use it as a second home, but ultimately rented it out and used it as an investment property.",
      "James has denied all wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of political retribution, after James sued President Trump in civil court and secured a nine-figure fraud judgment. The fine was later erased entirely by an appeals court.",
      "James to challenge Halligan's appointment",
      "In a two-page legal filing, James's lawyers alerted the court that they will file a motion Friday \"to dismiss the indictment that challenges the unlawful appointment of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan.\"",
      "The filing did not lay out the argument her lawyers plan to offer.",
      "Lawyers for former FBI Director James Comey also challenged Halligan's appointment earlier this week, arguing the charges against him for allegedly lying to Congress should be tossed out on the grounds that she was \"defectively appointed to her office.\"",
      "Halligan was appointed after the previous interim U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned after almost eight months on the job. The role is usually subject to a 120-day limit, but in Siebert's case, the judges in the Eastern District of Virginia voted to extend his term after the 120-day period elapsed. Comey's lawyers argue the 120-day clock began when Siebert started in January, making Halligan's appointment invalid.",
      "Several other temporary U.S. attorneys have faced similar challenges to their eligibility in recent months, including the top federal prosecutors in New Jersey and Nevada.",
      "James alleges Halligan broke Justice Department rules by speaking with reporter",
      "James also asked a judge Thursday to prohibit the Justice Department from disclosing case materials and investigative information to the media, in a court filing that criticized Halligan for texting a journalist last weekend to criticize coverage of the case.",
      "Anna Bower, a senior editor at Lawfare, wrote earlier this week that Halligan sent her unsolicited messages on the encrypted app Signal that criticized her for sharing a New York Times article about the James case on social media. Bower says Halligan accused her of \"jumping to conclusions\" and sharing \"biased\" information that was \"way off.\"",
      "\"You're biased. Your reporting isn't accurate. I'm the one handling the case and I'm telling you that,\" one message from Halligan read, according to Bower.",
      "In Thursday's filing, James's lawyers called Halligan's messages to Bower \"unusual and improper,\" and \"a stunning disclosure of internal government information.\"",
      "They argued the conversation violated court rules and internal Justice Department policies that bar the sharing of grand jury information and restrict prosecutors' out-of-court statements. By casting doubt on the accuracy of the Times article, James' lawyers said, Halligan was \"commenting on the evidence in the case and that which she likely learned as a result of grand jury testimony.\"",
      "This disclosure could undermine James's right to a fair trial, her lawyers claimed.",
      "\"It has been reported that Ms. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience whatsoever,\" the filing read. \"But all federal prosecutors are required to know and follow the rules governing their conduct from their first day on the job, and so any lack of experience cannot excuse their violation.\"",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department has faced similar pressure in other cases.",
      "Last month, attorneys for accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione asked a judge to bar federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, accusing federal and New York authorities of violating his rights. They pointed to statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the killing a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination,\" and criticized a late 2024 perp walk staged by federal and local authorities that looked like a \"scene out of a Marvel movie.\""

      "The Trump administration has conducted 40 removal flights to the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, deporting nearly 8,000 Venezuelan nationals since March, according to senior Department of Homeland Security officials who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The flights began after Venezuela agreed in March to resume repatriation flights, and have continued amid heightened U.S.-Venezuelan tensions in recent weeks.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported approximately 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on October 15. Last Wednesday's flight included at least seven individuals with criminal histories, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sexual predators, according to DHS.",
      "Among those deported include Jefferson Bracho Haddad, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member that a DHS spokesperson tells CBS News had six criminal arrests, including for larceny and drug possession. The agency spokesperson added that the flight also returned Angelo Dennis-Jesus Ainaga-Jaspe, convicted of multiple weapons offenses, plus Diego Alejandro Mavarez Arocha, convicted of sexual assault.",
      "DHS has repeatedly spotlighted removals of individuals with criminal histories as part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to deport undocumented migrants the government determines pose threats to public safety.",
      "\"These individuals, including confirmed Tren de Aragua gang members, sexual predators, and violent offenders, should have never been in our country in the first place,\" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement provided to CBS News, adding that an estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. since January.",
      "McLaughlin did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported. The vast majority would have needed to leave without making contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",
      "According to senior DHS officials, the deportations to Venezuela have occurred alongside the intensified U.S. campaign against drug trafficking and transnational crime in South America. The Trump administration has carried out at least 10 known strikes on suspected narcotics vessels over the past two months, including two this week off Colombia's Pacific coast. The most recent strike, conducted overnight, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was \"a lethal kinetic strike\" in international waters, marking the first night strike of the campaign. \"Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike \u2026 all six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.",
      "The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal, which allows the flights to Caracas, has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs within the United States.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, part of a buildup of U.S. forces in the region.",
      "The military maneuvers have drawn the Venezuelan government's ire. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered new military exercises last week, and he said he's prepared to declare a state of emergency earlier this month, accusing the U.S. of \"aggression.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 20:04:31 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said he's ending trade talks with Canada over an anti-tariff ad campaign by the province of Ontario that uses Ronald Reagan's voice \u2014 leading Ontario to pull the ads after this weekend.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The government of Ontario will pause an anti-tariff ad campaign aimed at the U.S., the Canadian province's leader announced Friday, less than a day after President Trump vowed to end trade negotiations with Canada over an ad that uses late President Ronald Reagan's voice.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday \"so that trade talks can resume.\" He said he's told his team to \"keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"",
      "The move came after Mr. Trump torched the ad on Truth Social late Friday, and wrote: \"Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\"",
      "The ad in question\u00a0includes excerpts from a 1987 radio address given by Reagan, in which the former president said tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Friday, prior to Ford's decision to pull the ad next week, that the Trump administration \"has repeatedly sought to address Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers.\"",
      "\"These good-faith efforts with Canadian officials have not led to any constructive progress,\" Desai said. \"Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks \u2014 that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade \u2014 is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the administration. As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.\"",
      "Ford wrote on X Friday: \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on Ford's decision.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters in response to the breakdown in talks Friday, \"we can't control the trade policy of the United States,\" but his government has sought to make progress on trade negotiations.",
      "\"We stand ready to pick up on that progress and build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions,\" he said.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said in a statement\u00a0that the ad used \"selective audio\" and \"misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.\" The foundation also said the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use snippets from Reagan's address, and said it is \"reviewing its legal options in this matter.\"",
      "Mr. Trump pointed to the Ronald Reagan Foundation's statement in his Truth Social post, calling Ontario's ad \"FAKE\" and claiming it \"only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court\" \u2014 referring to a pending case on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariff strategy.",
      "Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the U.S. after Mexico, with the U.S. importing $412.7 billion worth of Canadian goods last year, and Canada buying $349.4 billion in American goods, according to\u00a0U.S. statistics.",
      "But relations between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have frayed amid Mr. Trump's trade strategy. He initially imposed higher tariffs on Canada earlier this year, accusing the country of not doing enough to stem the flow of illicit drugs and migration across the border \u2014 allegations that Canadian officials pushed back on.",
      "Over the summer, Mr. Trump\u00a0hiked tariffs on the country\u00a0to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Carney\u00a0said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.",
      "Meanwhile, Carney\u00a0said earlier this week\u00a0the country would seek to double its exports to countries other than the U.S., citing the \"pall of uncertainty\" caused by American tariffs.",
      "Still, Carney has sought to negotiate with Mr. Trump, visiting the White House earlier this month.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Pentagon said Friday that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's campaign to counter narcotics traffickers.",
      "Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, said on X that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"has directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and embarked carrier air wing to the U.S. Southern Command\" area of responsibility. Southern Command is responsible for the Caribbean Sea, Central and South America and the surrounding waters.",
      "Parnell said the \"enhanced U.S. force presence\" will \"bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The USS Gerald R. Ford is the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, having been commissioned into service in 2017. At more than 1,100 ft. long with a displacement of 100,000 long tons, the carrier is the largest in the world. It's powered by two nuclear reactors and can reach a top speed of 34.5 mph, according to the\u00a0Navy.",
      "The carrier group will join eight U.S. vessels that are already in the region, including three destroyers, one cruiser, a littoral combat ship, an amphibious assault ship and two transport ships.",
      "The Ford is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, a defense official told CBS News, along with three destroyers.",
      "News of the decision to send the carrier group to Latin America comes after the U.S. launched another strike on a vessel allegedly operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The secretary\u00a0said on X\u00a0that the strike killed all six men who were on board, and took place in international waters. He said it was the first strike to take place at night.",
      "\"The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" he wrote. Hegseth posted a video, marked unclassified, showing the vessel as it was hit.",
      "This latest strike appears to be the 10th carried out by the Trump administration against alleged drug trafficking boats over the past several weeks, which have now led to more than 40 deaths. The first several took place in the Caribbean Sea, but this week, the administration's campaign broadened into the Pacific Ocean."

The first several took place in the Caribbean Sea, but this week, the administration's campaign broadened into the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Two men, one from Ecuador and the other from Colombia,\u00a0survived a U.S. strike on a suspected drug-trafficking submersible vessel in the Caribbean Sea last week and were repatriated. The Ecuadorian man was released after the authorities there found no evidence he committed a crime, Ecuador's attorney general's office said. The Colombian citizen was hospitalized, and authorities there said he would be prosecuted.",
      "Hegseth announced two other strikes that took place Tuesday and Wednesday, both of which he said occurred in the Eastern Pacific. In his social media posts, the Defense secretary has alleged that the vessels were operated by a \"designated terrorist organization,\" but did not name the group.",
      "The Pentagon announced later Friday that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the region, dramatically increasing the resources available in the anti-trafficking campaign. The USS Gerald Ford will join eight other vessels already in U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility.",
      "The Colombian government urged the U.S. earlier this week to stop attacking boats in the Pacific and Caribbean Sea and \"respect the norms dictated by international law.\" In an interview Thursday with CBS News national correspondent Lilia Luciano, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he believes that the White House needs to focus on the leaders of drug cartels, not suspected lower-level traffickers.",
      "\"Killing the workers of the business is easy, but if you want efficiency, you have to capture the bosses of the business,\" Petro told CBS News.",
      "President Trump has attacked Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who has a \"fresh mouth toward America,\" and threatened that if he didn't \"close up these killing fields immediately,\" then \"United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely.\"",
      "The administration told Congress earlier this month that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels and argued that the narcotics they bring into the country illegally is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually, which it said constitutes an \"armed attack.\"",
      "While Hegseth has claimed that the targeted vessels are moving along a \"known narco-trafficking route,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, told \"Face the National with Margaret Brennan\" that the routes through the Caribbean are predominantly used to traffick cocaine to Europe, not the U.S.",
      "The senator also said that when the administration briefed Congress on the strikes, they \"had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strikes have frustrated lawmakers\u00a0on both sides of the aisle, who have argued it needs congressional authorization to engage in hostilities with the drug cartels. Members of Congress have also said the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the targeted vessels are carrying drugs and have questioned the legality of the strikes.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively, sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Friday seeking information about the intelligence community's role in the operations and whether there has been any analysis conducted as to their legality.",
      "\"To be clear \u2014 we are acutely aware of the tens of thousands of American lives lost every year to illicit drugs and we agree that these dangerous criminal cartels should be held to account,\" they wrote. \"However, in order for us to conduct our basic, constitutionally required oversight of the IC there are fundamental questions that require answers, to include the factual basis for and effects of the strikes. Most importantly, good intelligence is critical to ensure that these operations do not kill innocent people with no connection to the drug trade.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday that his administration would continue to provide information to Congress on the strikes, but wouldn't seek a declaration of war.",
      "\"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead,\" he said.",
      "The president also suggested that there could be land strikes next, and may inform Congress about such a step.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next. And we may go to the Senate, we may go to the Congress and tell them about it. But I can't imagine they'd have any problem with it.\"",

      "The truck trundled through the streets of Washington, D.C., down Pennsylvania Avenue, past an exit for Nationals Park and then north along the Anacostia River. Uneven pavement jostled free bits of White House rubble in its wake.",
      "This week, demolition crews finished razing the East Wing and corridor that connected it to the White House residence. An upgraded walkway and 90,000-square foot ballroom will eventually take their place.",
      "Construction began last month with heavy equipment cycling in and out of the White House's east and south grounds.",

      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say the boats were known to be involved in drug smuggling, and insist they have the authority to carry out the strikes without authorization from Congress. Mr. Trump has long decried the influence of drug cartels in the United States, although the lethal strikes represent the biggest escalation in his war on drugs.",
      "Here's what's known about the Trump administration's strikes.",
      "How many boats have been struck?",
      "As of Friday, Oct. 24, the Trump administration has publicly disclosed strikes on 10 vessels since the president revealed the first operation on Sept. 2.",
      "The latest strike, on Oct. 24, was carried out against a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the U.S. operation killed six individuals.",
      "Where are they being targeted?",
      "Most of the strikes have taken place in the Caribbean, although the operation recently expanded into the Eastern Pacific. Two strikes in the Pacific have been disclosed by the administration.",
      "Several have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, which has been a key target in the president's war on drugs, as has Colombia.",
      "Are there plans for strikes on land?",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday it's possible that the U.S. may begin carrying out strikes on land. So far, the administration says it has only targeted vessels in international waters.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now, they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 23. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next.\"",
      "How many people have been killed in the strikes?",
      "At least 43 people have been killed in the strikes as of Friday, Oct. 24, according to the numbers released by the Trump administration. The first confirmed strike on Sept. 2 in the Caribbean resulted in the largest number of casualties, killing 11.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleges an attack in September killed a fisherman, not a drug smuggler, and claims the U.S. has committed \"murder.\" Mr. Trump, in response, called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and said the U.S. is cutting off all aid to the country. On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Petro and members of his family.",
      "Have there been any survivors?",
      "There were two survivors in an Oct. 16 strike on a vessel in the Caribbean. The two survivors were repatriated to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for \"detention and prosecution.\" The survivor turned over by the U.S. to Ecuador was released because authorities said they found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen who survived was hospitalized after being repatriated but will face prosecution. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\"",
      "How are the vessels being hit?",
      "The strikes are being conducted by the U.S. military, although the military hasn't disclosed tactical details of its operations. A source familiar with the operations said U.S. special operations forces are conducting the strikes. The Pentagon has used U.S. intelligence to carry out operations.",
      "Is this legal?",
      "The White House is required by the National Defense Authorization Act to notify Congress when it conducts a military attack. After a strike in mid-September, the administration sent a notice to Congress that called the three individuals who were killed in the strike \"unlawful combatants.\" This is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In its notification to Congress, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels. The president hasn't indicated that he thinks he needs congressional authorization.",
      "The president, asked on Oct. 23 by a reporter why he wouldn't ask Congress to declare war and authorize the strikes, replied, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Democrats and some Republicans in Congress worry the strikes could lead to a larger conflict in the Caribbean. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he wonders why U.S. leaders \"would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are.\" He says he wants to force a vote with a bipartisan group of senators to block the president from military action in the region unless explicitly authorized by Congress.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats ineffective, since the strikes are largely targeting alleged lower-level smugglers.",

      "The Pentagon said on Oct. 24 that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's campaign to counter narcotics traffickers.",

New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.",
      "The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"",
      "Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"",
      "The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.",
      "\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.",
      "The state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.",
      "Each of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.",
      "California is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.",
      "Election integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a\u00a02020 lawsuit\u00a0on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.",
      "\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.",
      "Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"",
      "Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.",
      "\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.",
      "Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks \u2014 and sometimes longer.",
      "In 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.",
      "California's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.",
      "The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.",
      "The county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.",
      "In 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson \u2014 the largest city in Passaic County \u2014 after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.",
      "Platkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"",
      "Local election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.",
      "Last year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.",
      "David Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor  who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.",
      "But Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro, as well as his wife, son and a close associate, an escalation of the feud between President Trump and the man he has called an \"illegal drug leader.\"",
      "The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced the sanctions on Petro and others, freezing their access to U.S. assets and blocking their ability to conduct transactions with U.S. entities.",
      "\"Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. \"President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity. Today, President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the U.S. \"will not turn a blind eye to Petro's appeasement and emboldening of narco-terrorists.\"",
      "\"We are committed to bringing terrorists and drug traffickers to justice and preventing deadly illegal drugs from entering our country,\" Pigott said. \"There must be no impunity for drug traffickers or acts of terrorism or violence by criminal armed groups.\"",
      "Petro has criticized\u00a0U.S. strikes\u00a0on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, which have killed more than 40 people. In response, Mr. Trump said he would cut all foreign aid to Colombia and threatened to hike tariffs.",
      "In a statement that was posted on X in Spanish and automatically translated, Petro reacted to the sanctions, writing: \"Fighting drug trafficking for decades ... has brought me this measure from the government of the society we helped so much to curb their cocaine consumption. A complete paradox, but not a step back and never on our knees.\"",
      "In an exclusive conversation with CBS News earlier this week, Petro claimed some of those killed by the U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law. The White House has denied that innocent civilians were killed in the boat strikes.",
      "The Pentagon also said Friday that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's\u00a0campaign\u00a0to counter narcotics traffickers.",

    "summary": "\"If someone strays into a pepper ball, that's on them,\" CBP Chief of Patrol Gregory Bovino told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Broadview, Illinois \u2014 Border Patrol Chief of Patrol Gregory Bovino, the architect of the Department of Homeland Security's \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" defended the sweeping campaign to arrest undocumented migrants and quell demonstrations in the Chicago area, calling federal agents' use of force \"exemplary.\"",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino told CBS News.",
      "The Border Patrol Chief of Patrol defended forceful tactics used by federal agents during the Chicago immigration crackdown, even as new videos and court filings raise questions about whether agents and even Bovino himself violated a judge's order barring tear gas and pepper balls at protests.",
      "Asked whether agents had defied that order, Bovino replied, \"I do not. All uses of force were well within CBP policy.\" He added, \"I'm not gonna let any violence be perpetrated against any federal agent or officer. Any use of force was well within CBP policy, as well as, I believe, anything else in conjunction with that court order.\"",
      "Footage from the Broadview detention facility shows agents in tactical gear firing pepper balls into crowds that included clergy and immigration advocates. In some clips, gas clouds drift across the street \u2014 despite a federal court order issued Oct. 9 prohibiting crowd-control devices in the city.",
      "Asked whether firing from elevated positions or above the waist violates DHS policy, Bovino insisted, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from \u2026 that is a less lethal device for area saturation.\" As for shots striking protesters above the waist, he said, \"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them. Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Bovino confirmed that all uses of force are reported to internal affairs, but told CBS News that no agents have been disciplined for their actions in Chicago.",
      "\"I believe everyone has acted well within policy,\" he said.",
      "Under DHS policy, use of force is only permitted when \"no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist\" and given it is \"objectionably reasonable\" under the circumstances. Less-lethal tactics must be deemed necessary, documented, and deployed only after de-escalation efforts fail, according to CBP policy.",
      "\"A model for immigration enforcement'",
      "Bovino, who oversaw a Los Angeles immigration enforcement crackdown earlier this year before moving onto the Windy City, called operations in Chicago \"a model for immigration enforcement.\" He said his agents have made nearly 2,700 arrests since the mission began Sept. 6, but did not provide a breakdown of those arrested who have pending criminal charges or convictions.",
      "\"Anywhere we're at is gonna be a model for immigration enforcement,\" he said. \"We've done this for 101 years \u2014 Chicago, Los Angeles, and many other areas of the United States.\"",
      "Pressed on how he measures success, Bovino cited \"arrests, removals, and deterrence.\" That includes encouraging noncitizens to use the CBP Home app, which allows voluntary departure in exchange for $1,000 and a plane ticket home. \"If we can deter and have those folks remove themselves rather than us doing it for 'em, it's better for all parties involved,\" he added.",
      "Asked if aggressive enforcement tactics were meant to drive self-deportations, Bovino replied, \"That's part of any policing strategy \u2014 deterrence \u2014 whether it's to deter a shoplifter in a department store or to deter illegal aliens from both coming across the border and/or remaining here.\"",
      "Bovino pushes back on Gov. Pritzker's claim that agents are targeting \"based on race or skin color\"",
      "Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has condemned the federal operation, accusing agents of targeting individuals \"based on race or skin color\" and announced a new accountability commission Thursday to gather alleged civil rights abuses by federal agents. Bovino dismissed the governor's comments outright, calling them \"the same tired rhetoric\" and \"fake news.\"",
      "\"Governor Pritzker probably ought to set a hotline up for himself \u2014 for all the abuses that illegal aliens perpetrate on American citizens,\" Bovino said. \"Ma and Pa America here in Chicago feel the brunt of illegal aliens,\" the CBP Chief Patrol agent continued. \"He needs to take a look at that rather than worry about the lawful, ethical, legal, and moral conduct of our nation's fantastic federal law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Bovino also blamed local leaders for \"handcuffing\" police. \"They could do so much more to keep their communities safe, but the problem is they're not allowed,\" he said. \"Mayor Johnson and Governor Pritzker will fire them if they do anything related to immigration enforcement.\"",
      "Under Illinois law, local police are prohibited from cooperating with most federal immigration actions, including detaining individuals solely on the basis of immigration status or federal immigration detainers. Local governments in the state are also banned from entering into new contracts with ICE in order to detain immigrants.",
      "In Chicago, city ordinance prohibits city employees, including Chicago police, from cooperating with federal immigration authorities under most circumstances, banishing them from sharing information about residents' immigration status or assisting in any civil immigration arrests.",
      "National Guard and the Insurrection Act",
      "Bovino also defended the proposed use of the National Guard in Chicago, noting any deployment is for \"the protection of the facility and also those detainees that are in the facility as well.\" The CBP chief of patrol explained that National Guard soldiers would not patrol city streets. \"That was fake news \u2026 It was never the intention.\"",
      "Still, Bovino described \"absolute chaos in the streets,\" adding that he supports the president's consideration of invoking the Insurrection Act. \"I can understand and fully support what President Trump and Secretary Noem say \u2026 I've never seen anything like this, even compared to Los Angeles.\"",
      "Asked when the mission in Chicago would end, Bovino replied, \"When all the illegal aliens utilize the CBP Home app and/or we arrest 'em all.\"",
      "He rejected concerns from city officials who have told federal agents to \"stay out.\" \"They're agenda-driven,\" he exclaimed. \"Inner city residents absolutely love the fact that we are in their neighborhoods arresting illegal aliens, because those are the people that don't have a voice. We've got their back.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said he will bring up the illegal drug problem when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea.",
      "\"The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl,\" Mr. Trump said during an event in the White House State Dining Room on Thursday meant to highlight the crackdown on drug cartels that traffic narcotics. \"I'm putting it right at the front of the list.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said at the event that the administration has so far seized 150,000 pounds of narcotics.",
      "\"Those aren't numbers \u2014 those are lives, lives saved by the millions. The millions. Enough fentanyl to kill over 200 million Americans gone, evaporated off our streets, permanently,\" Patel said at the White House event.",
      "The CDC estimates that there were 48,422 deaths tied to fentanyl in 2024, down from 76,282 the year before. The provisional estimates are based on state death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Mr. Trump announced days after taking office that he intended to impose duties on China for \"failing to stem\" the flow of drugs to the United States and \"by actively sustaining and expanding the business of poisoning our citizens.\"",
      "The Justice Department has made that effort a focal point. On Sept. 3, Patel revealed an indictment he called \"first-of-its-kind,\" charging Chinese companies and individuals that allegedly manufacture precursor chemicals needed for fentanyl production.",
      "\"This operation has already seized enough fentanyl powder to kill 70 million Americans and enough fentanyl pills to kill another 270,000,\" Patel said. \"And we have now indicted the Chinese precursor companies and exposed the funding streams that facilitate this deadly trade.\"",
      "During Senate testimony on Sept. 16, Patel added that the agency has also seized cryptocurrency wallets tied to mainland Chinese businesses and enterprises suspected of involvement in fentanyl production."

      "Norfolk, Virginia \u2014 New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of bank fraud in Norfolk, Virginia, after the Justice Department indicted her earlier this month.",
      "\"Not guilty, Judge, to both counts,\" James told U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, appointed to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden, who is presiding over the case.",
      "A trial in James' case is set to begin Jan. 26, though that could change. Walker said the proceedings should last roughly five days. James was released on her own recognizance.",
      "In remarks outside the courthouse after the proceeding, James thanked supporters \u2014 who were chanting \"we stand with you\" and had gathered for her arraignment. She said their support \"strengthened my spirit.\"",
      "\"This is not about me. This is about all of us and about a justice system which has been weaponized, a justice system which has been used as a tool of revenge \u2026 and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law, and a justice system which unfortunately is being used as a vehicle of retribution,\" she said.",
      "\"But my faith is strong and my faith is \u2026 I have this belief in the justice system and the rule of law, and I have a belief in America,\" James said.",
      "The New York attorney general said she has heard from people across the country urging her to remain strong.",
      "\"There's no fear today, no fear,\" James said. \"Because I believe that justice will rain down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream, and I'm here to say that my work and my job and all that I do all throughout my public career \u2014 I've stood up for the rights of New Yorkers and Americans and I will not be deterred ... I will not be distracted. I will do my job each and every day.\"",
      "James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said during the arraignment that he will seek to have the charges against James tossed out on several grounds, including vindictive and selective prosecution, and that the indictment does not allege appropriate charges.",
      "The judge set hearings on those motions for December.",
      "The indictment alleges that James misrepresented how she would use a house she bought in Norfolk in 2020, in order to obtain a lower interest rate on her mortgage. Instead of using the property as a second home, the indictment says, she rented it to a family member, treating it as an investment property, in contravention of the mortgage terms.",
      "According to the indictment, James purchased the home for $137,000 and borrowed $109,600 \u2014 and because she received more favorable lending terms and a larger seller credit, she allegedly saved $18,933 over the life of the loan.",
      "James called the charges \"baseless\" in a video statement.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,\" she said.",
      "James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said James \"flatly and forcefully denies these charges\" and said he is \"deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"",
      "In a\u00a0pair of\u00a0legal filings\u00a0Thursday, James' legal team took aim at the Trump-appointed prosecutor overseeing her bank fraud case, accusing interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan of an improper conversation with a journalist and vowing to seek dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that\u00a0Halligan\u00a0was unlawfully named to the job.",
      "Shortly after the proceeding ended, Lowell\u00a0filed\u00a0his bid to have the indictment dismissed on the grounds that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was invalid and unconstitutional. He's also seeking a court order that would block Halligan from supervising the prosecution of James' case and exercising any other duties as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Halligan, he wrote, \"had no authority to litigate this case on behalf of the United States.\"",
      "\"[B]ecause this indictment would not have been sought or obtained absent Ms. Halligan's unlawful appointment \u2026 the indictment's flaws cannot be brushed aside as harmless error,\" Lowell wrote. \"This Court must reject the Executive Branch's brazen attempt to sidestep the constitutional and statutory limitations on the appointment of U.S. Attorneys.\"",
      "Days before James was indicted, a grand jury impaneled by the same federal prosecutor's office handed up an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, on charges of lying to Congress, with whom Mr. Trump clashed during his first term. Comey is also seeking to have the charges against him tossed out on the basis that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney is invalid and unlawful.",
      "A hearing on those efforts in both Comey and James' cases will be held Nov. 13 in the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, before South Carolina federal judge Cameron Curry.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and James, as well as Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another vocal critic of his administration.",
      "The Justice Department launched a criminal probe into James in May regarding mortgage fraud. Three months later, it expanded its investigation into the Office of the New York Attorney General's handling of the Trump Organization probe.",
      "In February 2024, the state of New York won a civil fraud judgment\u00a0against Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization for $354 million in fines for submitting what the judge said was \"blatantly false financial data\" to accountants in order to borrow more money at more favorable interest rates.",
      "The ruling also barred the Trump Organization from seeking loans from financial institutions in New York for three years and also banned Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation for three years. An appellate court erased the fine in August, but James is appealing the ruling. The court kept the other sanctions in place, however.",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he had selected Halligan, a former White House aide, to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia after the abrupt ouster of the prosecutor he had originally named to the post, Erik Siebert.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Halligan presented evidence to the Comey and Letitia James grand juries alone, rather than with line prosecutors who had worked on the cases. Since Halligan became the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, several prosecutors have left the office or been fired.",
      "Two federal prosecutors in the office, Kristin Bird and Elizabeth Yusi, were terminated last week from their posts as assistant U.S. attorneys in the Norfolk office after they voiced opposition to the criminal case against James. The office's top national security official, Michael Ben'Ary, was also terminated in recent weeks.",
      "As a result of the turnover, two North Carolina federal prosecutors have been brought in to handle the Comey case, and a federal prosecutor from Missouri will be presenting the James case.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:25:10 -0400",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri, North Carolina and Utah's redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Then, in Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers have also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans.",
      "Challenges remain in all states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. And in California, the state's new map must be approved by voters in a November special election before it takes effect.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. It will still need a judge's final seal of approval.",
      "The only blue-leaning area of Utah, Salt Lake County, was split into three districts in the maps approved in 2021. But the proposed map will split Salt Lake County into two districts, speading out making Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But as University of Utah professor Matthew Burbank pointed out in an interview with CBS News, \"however the lines are drawn, Republicans are not likely to lose a whole lot of seats.\" Burbank said if the 2026 election is really competitive in Utah, it will likely have more to do with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The state is, at the moment, a little uncertain, not because Democrats have really done anything to make themselves more competitive,\" Burbank said. \"It's really been on the Republican side. There is a bit of a split \u2026 this was a state in 2016, a heavily Republican state but clearly not a pro-Trump state.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump won Utah in 2016, it was not by the margins that would be expected in such a red state. But in 2024, Mr. Trump did better in the state and other elected officials in the state seemed to have adjusted to be more pro-Trump \u2014 something that could cause backlash with voters in 2026.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department disclosed that it seeks to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia as soon as Oct. 31.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Justice Department said Friday that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and said the West African nation has agreed to accept him.",
      "In a\u00a0filing\u00a0with a federal judge in Maryland, Justice Department lawyers said that immigration officials expect to formally notify Abrego Garcia later Friday that Liberia has been designated as the new country of removal. They said the Trump administration expects to be able to deport Abrego Garcia as soon as Oct. 31.",
      "The administration has \"received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third-country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for [Abrego Garcia's] removal,\" they wrote.",
      "In the court filing, the Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia had identified more than 20 countries that he fears would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, and Liberia is not on the list.",
      "\"Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent,\" they wrote.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said the administration \"has chosen yet another path that feels designed to inflict maximum hardship.\"",
      "\"Their actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"Unless Liberia guarantees that it will not re-deport Mr. Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, then sending him to Liberia is no less unlawful than sending him directly to El Salvador a second time.\"",
      "The Trump administration's plan to remove Abrego Garcia to Liberia comes as the Maryland judge, Paula Xinis, is weighing whether to release the Salvadoran man from immigration custody while a challenge to the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing efforts to deport him for a second time moves forward.",
      "Abrego Garcia was removed to his home country of El Salvador in March and imprisoned there despite having been granted a legal status in 2019 that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him there because of possible persecution by local gangs. An immigration official with the Trump administration admitted that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an error, and Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "But immigration officials resisted doing so for months. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. in June, but only after a federal grand jury in Tennessee indicted him on two charges of human smuggling stemming from a November 2022 traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a judge in Tennessee said he should be released on bail ahead of the criminal trial, which is set to begin in January. But he remained in criminal confinement for several more weeks because his lawyers were concerned that the Trump administration would arrest him again upon his release and deport him.",
      "Abrego Garcia was\u00a0released from the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee in August and returned to Maryland, where he has lived since coming to the U.S. illegally in 2011. Days later, he was taken into custody by immigration authorities after being summoned for an interview at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore. The Trump administration notified Abrego Garcia's lawyers he may be deported to Uganda, though Abrego Garcia expressed fear of persecution and torture, as well as a concern that the Ugandan government would send him back to El Salvador.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration has searched for countries to accept Abrego Garcia and has sought to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini and Ghana. Neither of those two countries nor Uganda have agreed to take him. Abrego Garcia has said he would go to Costa Rica and designated it as his preferred country of removal. While Costa Rica has\u00a0indicated it would provide him refugee status or residency, a Justice Department lawyer said during a hearing earlier this month there had not been discussions about deporting him there.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg, his lawyer, reiterated on Friday that Costa Rica \"remains a viable and lawful option.\"",
      "Xinis has forbidden the Trump administration from deporting Abrego Garcia while she considers his challenge to his ongoing detention by immigration officials and the efforts to remove him again.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-2025-what-happens/",
    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:48:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15.

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",
      "Here is a look at the lapses in government funding that have taken place over the past four decades:",

      "Duration: Two full days",
      "White House: President Ronald Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The one-day shutdown was not the result of a bitter stalemate, but happened because members of Congress were busy with social commitments.",
      "The New York Times reported at the time\u00a0that \"congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Reagan had invited members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats had a $1,000-per-plate fundraising dinner.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown arose in part from Reagan's opposition to a measure that included billions in funding for a jobs creation program and Democrats' opposition to money for the MX missile program.",
      "Congress walked away from the jobs provision but included money for legal support for low-income Americans. Lawmakers also declined to fund the missile program, but Reagan still signed the legislation to end the shutdown.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown stemmed from Democrats adding roughly $1 billion in education spending, and cutting foreign aid. House Democrats ended up decreasing their request for education spending to $100 million and provided money for the MX missile, which Reagan wanted. Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",

      "What happened:\u00a0Reagan and congressional Democrats were at odds over several provisions included in a funding bill that cleared the House, namely a crime bill favored by the president, and a water projects measure he opposed. Democrats also wanted legislation reversing a Supreme Court decision that found entire colleges that did not accept federal or state funding were not subject to Title IX's requirements even though their students did receive federal assistance.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The stopgap funding measure passed days earlier didn't do enough to stave off another shutdown. Democrats ultimately gave in and removed the water projects and civil rights provisions, and Congress passed the crime bill.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The lapse in government funding was the result of disagreement over providing aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and Democrats' push to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, a policy from the Federal Communications Commission that required broadcast licensees to cover different sides of controversial issues. The rule was repealed in 1987.",
      "In the end, Congress approved nonlethal aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, but Democrats were unsuccessful in their efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.",

      "What happened:\u00a0Bush said he would veto a short-term funding measure that did not include a plan to reduce the deficit, forcing a shutdown.

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous, as far as this senator is concerned.\"",

      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

      "President Trump announced Thursday that he has called off a plan to deploy  federal agents to San Francisco, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie.",
      "In a statement on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said prominent tech company bosses had also  contacted him Wednesday, urging him not to go forward with a so-called \"surge\" operation set for Saturday, saying the city was making \"substantial progress.\"",
      "\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" the president said.",
      "\"Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a 'shot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!\" Trump said in conclusion, mentioning Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia and Benioff, the CEO and co-founder of Salesforce.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials also told CBS News Thursday afternoon that the planned Border Patrol operation in San Francisco had been canceled.",
      "Lurie said in a separate statement Thursday\u00a0that he had received a call from the president late Wednesday night.",
      "\"I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office,\" Lurie said. \"In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning.\"",
      "The mayor added, \"I am profoundly grateful to all the San Franciscans who came together over the last several days. Our city leaders have been united behind the goal of public safety. And our values have been on full display\u2014this is the best of our city.\"",
      "At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Lurie noted recently released crime statistics, which showed significant declines.",
      "\"Today, in San Francisco, crime is down nearly 30% citywide. And violent crime is at its lowest levels since the 1950s. Car break-ins are at 22-year lows and homicides are on track to hit 70-year lows,\" the mayor said. \"Our new approach is delivering results.\"",
      "Lurie also revealed that he spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, in addition to Noem, and received assurances in tackling the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\"She echoed her willingness to our local law enforcement to combat fentanyl and hold drug traffickers responsible,\" Lurie said.",
      "Benioff sparked controversy earlier this month in an interview with the New York Times, urging Trump to deploy the National Guard to the city to address public safety. The comments were made ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce convention in San Francisco.",
      "Following pushback from city officials and after saying the conference was successful, Benioff apologized for his comments.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom voiced support for Mr. Trump's last-minute change of plan.",
      "\"Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason \u2013 and heard what we have been saying from the beginning,\" said Newsom, who once served as San Francisco's mayor himself. \"The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we've done.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the mayor in her statement.",
      "\"Mayor Daniel Lurie has demonstrated exceptional leadership in his steadfast commitment to the safety and well-being of San Franciscans,\" Pelosi said. \"He has underscored that public safety must be driven by local priorities, respectful of our values and communities.\"",
      "The announcement came  on the same day Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive at Coast Guard Island in Alameda\u00a0as the Trump administration's nationwide immigration crackdown was set to expand to the Bay Area.",
      "Across the Bay in Oakland, political and community leaders gathered outside Oakland City Hall to denounce the arrival of Border Patrol agents, urging citizens to remain calm despite what Mayor Barbara Lee called the federal government's \"escalated rhetoric and enforcement posture\" in the Bay Area.",
      "\"These federal actions are not about public safety,\" Lee said. \"They're political stunts designed to divide and to intimidate. Oakland will not take the bait. We will remain calm, focused and united.\"",
      "Lee said that while Trump called off a planned immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco, she doesn't know what the administration's plans are for Oakland and neighboring cities.",
      "\"I have not received any communication from the White House or the Department of Homeland Security regarding federal operations in Oakland; however, I am in touch with the Governor's Office and our federal delegation,\" Lee said.",
      "She added, \"We know that border patrol agents are being stationed on Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, our city, we are fully prepared.\u00a0 We are monitoring developments closely and will keep our residents informed if there are any confirmed changes. We will continue to be a welcoming city for immigrants. \"",

      "\"But you know what, the city means more to me than anything, and it is time for us as a family to come together,\" the mayor said.",
      "It's the endorsement Cuomo has been waiting for ever since Adams dropped out of the race, and represented a major mending of fences between two men who said harsh things about each other in the heat of the campaign. It was only last month Adams called Cuomo \"a snake and a liar\" as the two campaigned for Gracie Mansion.",
      "Adams blasts Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent",

You can't freeze rent, but you are lying and telling people you can do so. We're fighting against a snake oil salesman who has sold us a bill of goods,\" Adams said. \"And who is his base of support? Gentrifiers. Gentrifiers have raised the rent in this city, and disrespected communities for far too long. And he is the king of the gentrifiers.\"",
      "\"He believes Zohran is an existential threat to New York City, and we all have to do our best to make sure that Zohran does not become the next mayor,\" Cuomo said. \"I applaud him for that, and I have great respect for that.\"",

It's no surprise to see two men who share an affinity for corruption and Trump capitulation align themselves at the behest of the billionaire class and the President himself.

And some things really need to be done, particularly in Black and Brown communities, which have suffered under the crushing weight of gentrification and displacement in neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem \u2026 that's going to be important and at the top of his agenda.

The dismissal also\u00a0raised questions about his relationship with President Trump\u00a0and the\u00a0influence of the White House on City Hall.",
      "Adams\u00a0maintained his innocence\u00a0and his ability to lead the city,\u00a0launching his reelection campaign\u00a0over the summer. But most polls showed him\u00a0garnering single-digit support, well behind Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa.",
      "\"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign,\" Adams said in a video announcement when he dropped out.",

      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",

      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",

    "summary": "A pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested last weekend for allegedly threatening to kill the top House Democrat.",
    "story": [
      "A pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News said Christopher Moynihan was arrested Sunday after saying in text messages that he planned to \"eliminate\" Jeffries when the top House Democrat spoke at the Economic Club of New York in New York City on Monday, Oct. 20.",
      "Moynihan was arraigned Tuesday and entered a plea of not guilty. He was released on bond on Saturday, prosecutors told CBS News, pending future court proceedings.",
      "According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.\"",
      "Moynihan also allegedly stated: \"Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future,\" the filing said.",
      "Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Jeffries noted that Moynihan had been pardoned by Mr. Trump on his first day in office and that \"many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country.\" But Jeffries added that \"threats of violence will not stop us from showing up, standing up and speaking up for the American people.\"",
      "Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney.",
      "Dutchess County, New York district attorney Anthony Parisi said in a statement to CBS News that \"although my office was not contacted during the investigative stage of this matter, we are now reviewing the case for legal and factual sufficiency.\"",
      "Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.",
      "Prosecutors described Moynihan as being among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: \"While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'\"",
      "Prosecutors said Moynihan \"occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting,\" and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.",
      "Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.",
      "A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\"",
      "State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.",
      "Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.",
      "Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as \"hostages\" by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of \"raising a firearm at police\" in early 2025 and \"acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol,\" according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.",
      "Zachary Alam, who was convicted of eight felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, was arrested weeks after his 2025 presidential pardon for allegedly breaking and entering a home near Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Other Jan. 6 defendants have since been arrested for other alleged criminal infractions that occurred before the siege or in the years between 2021 and the pardon.",
      "The alleged threat against Jeffries is also part of a fast-growing wave of threats against legislators. In a statement last month, Capitol Police said the number of threat investigations in 2025 had already eclipsed 14,000, more than the number of cases in all of 2024.",
      "The Capitol riot injured more than 140 police officers and caused millions of dollars of damage to the Capitol complex. It interrupted the certification of the electoral vote from the 2020 election and triggered the evacuation of Congress, with leadership sent to a secure, secret location.",
      "Some rioters chanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence, threatened to kill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and beat police officers with dozens of makeshift weapons, including bats, sticks, poles, bear spray and beams. Some were accused of carrying guns, knives and handmade weapons.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 23:56:38 -0400",
    "summary": "\"There's nothing more important to the league and its fans than the integrity of the competition,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Friday. \"I had a pit in my stomach. It was very upsetting.\"",
    "story": [
      "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, in his first public comments since the arrests of Portland coach Chauncey Billups and Miami guard Terry Rozier on gambling-related charges, said Friday night that he was stunned by the indictments that have rocked the league.",
      "\"My initial reaction was I was deeply disturbed,\" Silver said on Amazon Prime Video, during the streaming service's first broadcast \u2014 Boston at New York. \"There's nothing more important to the league and its fans than the integrity of the competition. I had a pit in my stomach. It was very upsetting.\"",
      "Such was a sentiment shared by many around the league on Friday, one day after the indictments were unsealed and nearly three dozen people \u2014 most notably, Billups and Rozier \u2014 were arrested by federal officials.",
      "Rozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance. The charges are similar to what former Toronto player Jontay Porter faced before he was banned from the league by Silver in 2024.",
      "Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, told CBS News in a statement Thursday that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, of investigators, but then \"at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel.\" Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting \"the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.\"",
      "Billups faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering for participating in what federal officials called Mafia-backed, rigged poker games. He also matches the credentials of someone described only as Co-Conspirator 8 in an indictment detailing how some people gave bettors inside information on player health statuses.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Thursday night, an attorney for Billups wrote that \"to believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game. Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to.\"",
      "The arrests have overshadowed the opening week around the league.",
      "\"I apologize to our fans that we are all dealing with this situation,\" Silver said during the in-game interview.",
      "The Rozier case has gone on since March 23, 2023. He was with the Charlotte Hornets at that time, and sportsbooks \u2014 legal ones \u2014 alerted the NBA to irregular patterns involving Rozier's \"prop bets\" that day. Rozier went on to play about 9 1/2 minutes, and those who bet that he would underperform the listed stat lines won those wagers. Federal officials said more than $200,000 was bet on those lines alone.",
      "The NBA investigated and found no reason to sanction Rozier, Silver said.",
      "\"We frankly couldn't find anything,\" Silver said. \"Terry at the time cooperated. He gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. And we ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence despite that aberrational behavior to move forward.",
      "\"He still hasn't been convicted of anything, in fairness to Terry. Obviously, it doesn't look good. But he's now been put on administrative leave. There's a balance here of protecting people's rights and investigating.\"",
      "Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue calls Billups his best friend and said the news was difficult to take. He said he spoke with Billups on Thursday night and was encouraged by what he heard.",
      "\"To go through something like this, the allegations, his family, my goddaughters, it was a tough day,\" Lue said. \"You never want to see your friends go through anything like that.\"",
      "Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers started in the NBA as a player more than 40 years ago. He's seen plenty of good and bad. He thought he had heard it all. That is, until now.",
      "\"It's really sad,\" Rivers said Friday.",
      "Along with Billups and Rozier, former NBA player Damon Jones now faces charges because officials said he tipped off bettors about the health status of two Los Angeles Lakers players. The details in that indictment clearly show that Jones was discussing the availability of LeBron James and former Lakers center Anthony Davis with bettors before their statuses for certain games was known publicly. There is no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was alleged to be doing.",
      "\"We see now what those things can turn into and how they can spread, just how valuable this information is,\" Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \"It's a difficult situation overall but once you introduce gambling that the sports world has now, there's going to be some very dangerous situations out there for everybody \u2014 from a security standpoint, from this type of thing standpoint.\"",
      "All teams are required by the NBA to educate players, coaches and staff annually about what is allowed and not allowed when it comes to gambling. The Orlando Magic met recently about that very topic.",
      "And then after the news Thursday, they met again.",
      "\"Yesterday was another reminder of what we have to do,\" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. \"We had another conversation with the group. I think the more that is going on, the more we have to continue to talk to the group about what is happening.\"",
      "The league has at least 14 relationships with sportsbooks, including FanDuel and DraftKings. Some teams have their own deals as well. Silver has often spoken of how legal betting can be monitored and how unusual patterns can be flagged immediately, part of the reason why the league believes the integrity of games can be protected.",
      "But some coaches and players still believe more can be done.",
      "\"The league, the game and the business of the league has evolved. And so we just have to be aware of how things evolve in this business, right?\" San Antonio coach Mitch Johnson said. \"It's very important for us to continue to just be educated and mindful of everything that has to do with our business. ... I believe in Adam Silver and the league, that they will do whatever is necessary to continue to grow the game in the right way.\"",
      "Another issue for players and coaches is how social media has given bettors ways to communicate with those inside the league. Those interactions, many have said, are not always friendly.",
      "\"The outside world, in my day, couldn't get to us. They literally couldn't get to us,\" Rivers said Friday. \"And now they can, with ease.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is proposing to auction offshore oil drilling leases across new portions of the U.S. coast as soon as 2026, according to internal documents viewed by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing to auction offshore oil drilling leases across new portions of the U.S. coast as soon as 2026, according to internal Department of Interior draft documents viewed by CBS News.",
      "New leases would include waters off New England, the Carolinas and California.",
      "Offshore oil leases are common along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana, as well as parts of Alaska, but there are currently no active oil leases on the Atlantic coast, and California has not had a new oil lease since 1984.",
      "This comes as the Department of Interior formally\u00a0announced\u00a0plans this week to reopen 1.56 million aces in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden administration decision to limit oil drilling in the Arctic.",
      "That decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who accused the administration of rewarding the fossil fuel industry for its support of the president. \"This decision is not about energy dominance\u2014it's about donor dominance,\" Markey said in a statement. \"The Trump administration must immediately reverse its shortsighted decision. The Arctic Refuge is not for sale.\"",
      "The Department of Interior is\u00a0assessing new oil leases\u00a0as part of the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, which issues oil leases in five-year increments. The Biden administration set the previous plan and had the fewest leases on record, with only three.",
      "Documents reviewed by CBS News included assessments of whether state governments favored offshore drilling, and indicated that the states opposed it. The documents also included potential dates for leasing each tract of seafloor.",
      "If the plan is approved by the Interior secretary and moves forward, California could see lease sales as soon as 2027 and the Beaufort Sea in Alaska, which includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, could see lease sales as early as 2026. Under the terms of the lease, a company would then have five to 10 years, depending on the water depth in the area, to explore and develop oil and gas production.",
      "The Trump administration opened\u00a0a public comment period in April\u00a0for a new five-year gas leasing policy. Lawmakers from both parties voiced concerns about offshore drilling, including members of Congress and state governors, and the process drew more than 34,000 comments.",
      "Governors Josh Stein (D, North Carolina) and Henry McMaster (R, South Carolina),\u00a0issued a joint statement\u00a0opposing the idea, saying there has been broad bipartisan consensus against offshore drilling because of, \"the risks that these activities pose to the economy and environment of our states.\"",
      "In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June, McMaster\u00a0wrote, \"Every coastal municipality in South Carolina has passed a resolution opposing oil and gas exploration activities offshore. I stand firmly with them. We simply cannot afford to accept the risk of the adverse environmental impact attendant to offshore drilling.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to McMaster for comment, but his office did not respond.",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican who is running for governor of South Carolina, issued a\u00a0similar letter\u00a0to Burgum, writing, \"In South Carolina, there is widespread bipartisan agreement in opposing offshore drilling off the coast of our state.\"",
      "The Trump administration tried to open new offshore oil leases during his first term, but backtracked when Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina lawmakers from both parties criticized the effort. The Trump administration instituted bans on offshore drilling in waters surrounding those states shortly before the 2020 election. The current iteration of the plan does not include offshore oil leases off Florida's coast, but it is unclear whether those bans will continue off the Carolinas.",
      "CBS News reached out to the White House and Department of Interior for more information about the plans. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing policy discussions.",
      "The Biden administration issued a record low number of offshore oil leases, and withdrew 625 million acres along the Pacific, Atlantic and Alaska coasts from offshore oil development. The Trump administration rescinded those Biden withdrawals, and a federal court in Louisiana ruled this month that the Biden withdrawals were illegal.",
      "Offshore oil leases have been unpopular for decades. Congress had a moratorium preventing drilling on both coasts and the eastern Gulf from 1981 to 2008, and President George H.W. Bush issued an executive order preventing offshore drilling which stood until 2008, when his son\u00a0lifted the order.",
      "The Obama administration had once considered opening the Atlantic coast to offshore oil leases but changed its stance following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf.",
      "The Department of Interior is expected to publish its first proposal on the subject in the coming weeks. There will be two additional comment periods before a final plan is proposed and implemented.",

    "summary": "Inflation last month rose at an annual rate of 3%, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The government of Ontario will pause an anti-tariff ad campaign aimed at the U.S., the Canadian province's leader announced Friday, less than a day after President Trump vowed to end trade negotiations with Canada over an ad that uses late President Ronald Reagan's voice.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the ad campaign will be put on hold starting Monday \"so that trade talks can resume.\" He said he's told his team to \"keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"",
      "The move came after Mr. Trump torched the ad on Truth Social late Friday, and wrote: \"Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\"",
      "The ad in question\u00a0includes excerpts from a 1987 radio address given by Reagan, in which the former president said tariffs work \"only for a short time\" and \"hurt every American worker and consumer.\"",
      "\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said, as quoted by the ad.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement on Friday, prior to Ford's decision to pull the ad next week, that the Trump administration \"has repeatedly sought to address Canada's longstanding, unfair trade barriers.\"",
      "\"These good-faith efforts with Canadian officials have not led to any constructive progress,\" Desai said. \"Ontario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks \u2014 that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade \u2014 is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the administration. As President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.\"",
      "Ford wrote on X Friday: \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment on Ford's decision.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters in response to the breakdown in talks Friday, \"we can't control the trade policy of the United States,\" but his government has sought to make progress on trade negotiations.",
      "\"We stand ready to pick up on that progress and build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions,\" he said.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said in a statement\u00a0that the ad used \"selective audio\" and \"misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.\" The foundation also said the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use snippets from Reagan's address, and said it is \"reviewing its legal options in this matter.\"",
      "Mr. Trump pointed to the Ronald Reagan Foundation's statement in his Truth Social post, calling Ontario's ad \"FAKE\" and claiming it \"only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court\" \u2014 referring to a pending case on the legality of Mr. Trump's tariff strategy.",
      "Canada is the second-largest trading partner for the U.S. after Mexico, with the U.S. importing $412.7 billion worth of Canadian goods last year, and Canada buying $349.4 billion in American goods, according to\u00a0U.S. statistics.",
      "But relations between the U.S. and its northern neighbor have frayed amid Mr. Trump's trade strategy. He initially imposed higher tariffs on Canada earlier this year, accusing the country of not doing enough to stem the flow of illicit drugs and migration across the border \u2014 allegations that Canadian officials pushed back on.",
      "Over the summer, Mr. Trump\u00a0hiked tariffs on the country\u00a0to 35%, though a large share of goods are exempt because they're covered by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.",
      "Back in March, Canada imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on many U.S. products not covered by the USMCA. But in August, as part of efforts to reach a deal on tariffs, Carney\u00a0said those retaliatory tariffs were being lifted. The two nations have yet to reach such a deal.",
      "Meanwhile, Carney\u00a0said earlier this week\u00a0the country would seek to double its exports to countries other than the U.S., citing the \"pall of uncertainty\" caused by American tariffs.",

      "Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, said on X that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"has directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and embarked carrier air wing to the U.S. Southern Command\" area of responsibility. Southern Command is responsible for the Caribbean Sea, Central and South America and the surrounding waters.",

At more than 1,100 ft. long with a displacement of 100,000 long tons, the carrier is the largest in the world. It's powered by two nuclear reactors and can reach a top speed of 34.5 mph, according to the\u00a0Navy.",

      "News of the decision to send the carrier group to Latin America comes after the U.S. launched another strike on a vessel allegedly operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.",

The first several took place in the Caribbean Sea, but this week, the administration's campaign broadened into the Pacific Ocean."

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:22:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Since September, the U.S. has been carrying out strikes on alleged drug cartel boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. has been carrying out intermittent strikes on vessels alleged to be carrying drug smugglers and illegal narcotics in international waters off South American coastlines since early September.",
      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say the boats were known to be involved in drug smuggling, and insist they have the authority to carry out the strikes without authorization from Congress. Mr. Trump has long decried the influence of drug cartels in the United States, although the lethal strikes represent the biggest escalation in his war on drugs.",
      "Here's what's known about the Trump administration's strikes.",
      "How many boats have been struck?",
      "As of Friday, Oct. 24, the Trump administration has publicly disclosed strikes on 10 vessels since the president revealed the first operation on Sept. 2.",
      "The latest strike, on Oct. 24, was carried out against a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the U.S. operation killed six individuals.",
      "Where are they being targeted?",
      "Most of the strikes have taken place in the Caribbean, although the operation recently expanded into the Eastern Pacific. Two strikes in the Pacific have been disclosed by the administration.",
      "Several have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, which has been a key target in the president's war on drugs, as has Colombia.",
      "Are there plans for strikes on land?",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday it's possible that the U.S. may begin carrying out strikes on land. So far, the administration says it has only targeted vessels in international waters.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now, they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 23. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next.\"",
      "How many people have been killed in the strikes?",
      "At least 43 people have been killed in the strikes as of Friday, Oct. 24, according to the numbers released by the Trump administration. The first confirmed strike on Sept. 2 in the Caribbean resulted in the largest number of casualties, killing 11.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleges an attack in September killed a fisherman, not a drug smuggler, and claims the U.S. has committed \"murder.\" Mr. Trump, in response, called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and said the U.S. is cutting off all aid to the country. On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Petro and members of his family.",
      "Have there been any survivors?",
      "There were two survivors in an Oct. 16 strike on a vessel in the Caribbean. The two survivors were repatriated to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for \"detention and prosecution.\" The survivor turned over by the U.S. to Ecuador was released because authorities said they found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen who survived was hospitalized after being repatriated but will face prosecution. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\"",
      "How are the vessels being hit?",
      "The strikes are being conducted by the U.S. military, although the military hasn't disclosed tactical details of its operations. A source familiar with the operations said U.S. special operations forces are conducting the strikes. The Pentagon has used U.S. intelligence to carry out operations.",
      "Is this legal?",
      "The White House is required by the National Defense Authorization Act to notify Congress when it conducts a military attack. After a strike in mid-September, the administration sent a notice to Congress that called the three individuals who were killed in the strike \"unlawful combatants.\" This is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In its notification to Congress, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels. The president hasn't indicated that he thinks he needs congressional authorization.",
      "The president, asked on Oct. 23 by a reporter why he wouldn't ask Congress to declare war and authorize the strikes, replied, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Democrats and some Republicans in Congress worry the strikes could lead to a larger conflict in the Caribbean. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he wonders why U.S. leaders \"would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are.\" He says he wants to force a vote with a bipartisan group of senators to block the president from military action in the region unless explicitly authorized by Congress.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats ineffective, since the strikes are largely targeting alleged lower-level smugglers.",
      "\"You have to capture the bosses,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "What else is the Trump administration doing to combat drug trafficking from Latin America?",
      "The Pentagon said on Oct. 24 that the U.S. is sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the waters off Latin America, an escalation that will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to the Trump administration's campaign to counter narcotics traffickers.",

      "\"Those aren't numbers \u2014 those are lives, lives saved by the millions. The millions. Enough fentanyl to kill over 200 million Americans gone, evaporated off our streets, permanently,\" Patel said at the White House event.",

      "The Justice Department has made that effort a focal point. On Sept. 3, Patel revealed an indictment he called \"first-of-its-kind,\" charging Chinese companies and individuals that allegedly manufacture precursor chemicals needed for fentanyl production.",
      "\"This operation has already seized enough fentanyl powder to kill 70 million Americans and enough fentanyl pills to kill another 270,000,\" Patel said. \"And we have now indicted the Chinese precursor companies and exposed the funding streams that facilitate this deadly trade.\"",
      "During Senate testimony on Sept. 16, Patel added that the agency has also seized cryptocurrency wallets tied to mainland Chinese businesses and enterprises suspected of involvement in fentanyl production."

      "Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesman, said on X that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"has directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and embarked carrier air wing to the U.S. Southern Command\" area of responsibility. Southern Command is responsible for the Caribbean Sea, Central and South America and the surrounding waters.",
      "Parnell said the \"enhanced U.S. force presence\" will \"bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The USS Gerald R. Ford is the Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, having been commissioned into service in 2017. At more than 1,100 ft. long with a displacement of 100,000 long tons, the carrier is the largest in the world. It's powered by two nuclear reactors and can reach a top speed of 34.5 mph, according to the\u00a0Navy.",
      "The carrier group will join eight U.S. vessels that are already in the region, including three destroyers, one cruiser, a littoral combat ship, an amphibious assault ship and two transport ships.",
      "The Ford is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, a defense official told CBS News, along with three destroyers.",
      "News of the decision to send the carrier group to Latin America comes after the U.S. launched another strike on a vessel allegedly operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The secretary\u00a0said on X\u00a0that the strike killed all six men who were on board, and took place in international waters. He said it was the first strike to take place at night.",
      "\"The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" he wrote. Hegseth posted a video, marked unclassified, showing the vessel as it was hit.",
      "This latest strike appears to be the 10th carried out by the Trump administration against alleged drug trafficking boats over the past several weeks, which have now led to more than 40 deaths. The first several took place in the Caribbean Sea, but this week, the administration's campaign broadened into the Pacific Ocean."

      "\"Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. \"President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity. Today, President Trump is taking strong action to protect our nation and make clear that we will not tolerate the trafficking of drugs into our nation.\"",

      "\"We are committed to bringing terrorists and drug traffickers to justice and preventing deadly illegal drugs from entering our country,\" Pigott said. \"There must be no impunity for drug traffickers or acts of terrorism or violence by criminal armed groups.\"",
      "Petro has criticized\u00a0U.S. strikes\u00a0on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, which have killed more than 40 people. In response, Mr. Trump said he would cut all foreign aid to Colombia and threatened to hike tariffs.",
      "In a statement that was posted on X in Spanish and automatically translated, Petro reacted to the sanctions, writing: \"Fighting drug trafficking for decades ... has brought me this measure from the government of the society we helped so much to curb their cocaine consumption. A complete paradox, but not a step back and never on our knees.\"",
      "In an exclusive conversation with CBS News earlier this week, Petro claimed some of those killed by the U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.

      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",

      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",

      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",

    "summary": "The boy ate between 80 and 100 magnets, which he said had been purchased from an online retailer.",
    "story": [
      "A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized after eating dozens of high-powered magnets, according to a recently published case report in the New Zealand Medical Journal. The boy lost part of his bowel as a result, doctors wrote.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the case report, ate between 80 and 100 magnets. The \"high-power\" magnets were 5x2 millimeters each, the report said.",
      "After eating the magnets, the teen had general abdominal pain for four days. When he arrived at the hospital, he told doctors he had eaten the magnets about a week earlier. The hospital he was treated at was not identified in the report.",
      "The case report did not say if the boy explained why or how he ate the magnets.",
      "Eating multiple magnets can be incredibly dangerous because they can clamp together inside the body and cause organ damage or other complications. Patients who eat multiple magnets often need surgical intervention, according to the report. High-powered magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys for adults, are particularly risky. They can be five to 10 times stronger than traditional refrigerator magnets, CBS News reported in 2019.",
      "Scans showed that the magnets had linked into four chains inside the teen's bowel and at the start of his large intestine. The amount of magnets in his body disrupted some imaging, the report said, so doctors proceeded with an exploratory surgery.",
      "During the operation, surgeons found the magnet chains were causing pressure necrosis in the bowel and large intestine. Pressure necrosis occurs when tissue dies because there is too much pressure on it for an extended period of time. The surgeons were able to successfully remove the magnets, and the boy recovered from the operation. He was discharged after eight days in the hospital, the report said.",
      "The sale of these high-powered magnets has been permanently banned in New Zealand, but the prohibition is difficult to enforce because the magnets can be easily and cheaply purchased online, the report noted. The boy told doctors he purchased the magnets on the online site Temu.",
      "Temu told CBS News that they were \"sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery,\" but said they could not confirm if the magnets had been purchased on their site or identify a specific product listing.",
      "An internal review has been launched and teams are reviewing product listings to ensure compliance with local regulations, a spokesperson for the retailer said. Any products \"found to be non-compliant will be removed,\" and action will also be taken against sellers found to have breached platform rules and regulations, Temu said.",
      "\"We take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Online retailers, including Amazon and AliExpress, list high-powered magnets as available to ship to New Zealand.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has worked to limit the sale of high-powered magnets in the United States. In 2014, the agency issued a ban on high-powered magnet sets, but it was overturned in court two years later. In September 2022, the agency established a mandatory safety standard for magnets. The rule sets a power limit for any product with loose or separable magnets, including those intended for purposes including entertainment and stress relief.",

Petro calls the strikes easy but ineffective in tackling the mammoth problem of drug smuggling \u2014  and illegal to boot.",
      "The Trump administration has announced at least 10 such strikes on boats during the past two months, including two off Colombia's Pacific coast this week. The most recent came overnight, when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. carried out \"a lethal kinetic strike\" on a vessel he said was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, \"trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean Sea.\"",
      "Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters \u2014 and was the first strike at night. All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.\"",
      "Aside from announcing the strikes, the U.S. military and the Trump administration have provided virtually no information about how they are carried out, based on what intelligence, or who, specifically, has been killed.",

      "Asked if he was ready to lower the rhetorical tone in his war of words with Mr. Trump, to seek a diplomatic way of stopping the U.S. attacks on boats, Petro insisted that he was merely replying to the American leader in kind.",
      "The Drug Enforcement Administration says about 90% of the cocaine that reaches the U.S. comes from Colombia, and President Trump has blamed Petro, saying he's failed to rein in drug cartels that operate in his country.",
      "\"They have insulted me,\" he told CBS News. \"And a lot, but all I can do is be frank.\"",
      "\"Colombia's a drug den,\" President Trump said recently. \"You got a lousy leader over there right now. Bad guy, a thug, but they make cocaine at levels that we've never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is correct to note that cocaine production in Colombia has increased in recent years. But Petro said the issue should be addressed as a collaborative effort, not unilateral sneak attacks. He said he would welcome Mr. Trump to his presidential palace for a dialogue, and was adamant that Colombia got no warning about the U.S. strikes.",
      "\"We don't even know where\" they're going to happen, he told CBS News. \"Nothing. We don't know if they had or didn't have cocaine.\"",
      "Petro said launching missiles at small boats carrying a few people is a war crime, and he noted that at least 37 people had been killed in the U.S. strikes \u2014 before Hegseth's announcement on Friday that six more alleged \"narco-terrorists\" were struck.",
      "Petro doesn't call the people killed on the boats traffickers; he says they're people who work for the traffickers",
      "\"Killing the business' workers is easy,\" he said. \"But if you want to be effective, you have to capture the bosses of the business.\"",
      "He said major shipments should be targeted, not small smuggling boats.",
      "This week, President Trump said his war on drugs could soon move from the water onto land, and on Thursday, two long-range U.S. B-1 bombers flew near Venezuela.",
      "Petro told CBS News that he hoped no U.S. operations would cross Colombia's borders, and he warned that any such move could lead to more violence by inspiring more people to join insurgency groups.",
      "\"I myself was an insurgent myself,\" he said. \"I am not threatening, but anyone who reads the history of Colombia in two centuries will know that when farmers are attacked, they head up to hide in the mountains and they take up arms.\"",
      "\"It's better to talk instead,\" he urged President Trump, who has threatened to halt all U.S. aid to Colombia.",
      "Petro said if that happens, his government will be able to fill funding gaps, and he's not losing sleep over the Trump administration's tariffs threats, either.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:19:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Ukraine's leader was greeted by King Charles as he arrived in the U.K. on Friday to strategize with European backers on ways to defund Putin's war machine.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy began his third visit to Britain this year with a highly symbolic show of support from one of his country's most vociferous Western partners.",
      "Zelenskyy was greeted on Friday by both rare British autumn sunshine and King Charles III at Windsor Castle, ahead of a summit with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders from the so-called \"coalition of the willing,\" who are determined to show that dozens of countries stand united behind Ukraine as Russia's devastating full-scale invasion nears the four-year mark.",
      "After the pomp and ceremony of his meeting with Charles, Zelenskyy headed into central London to spend the day meeting with Starmer and other senior European and NATO figures, discussing how to pile more pressure on Vladimir Putin's Russia to end the war.",
      "The objective, as highlighted this week by newly-announced sanctions against Russia from both the Trump administration and the European Union, is to hit Putin where it hurts \u2014 in the bank account.",
      "Russia's ability to continue selling oil and gas despite the ever-mounting sanctions aimed at choking off Putin's energy-fueled war economy will be one of the primary focuses of the coalition meeting on Friday.",
      "Moscow has proven adept at maneuvering around the sanctions, thanks to willing global partners and a so-called \"shadow fleet\" of tankers that still ply the seas.",
      "Partners including Starmer, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof will be there in person to strategize with Zelenskyy, while about 20 other leaders are set to join via video link.",
      "According to a statement posted online by Britain's government, the leaders \"are expected to use the meeting to focus the world's attention on how they can further strengthen Ukraine's hand and cripple Russia's ability to continue to wage war.\"",
      "\"The only person involved in this conflict who does not want to stop the war is President Putin, and his depraved strikes on young children in a nursery this week make that crystal clear,\" Starmer said in the statement. \"Time and again we offer Putin the chance to end his needless invasion, to stop the killing and recall his troops, but he repeatedly rejects those proposals and any chance of peace. From the battlefield to the global markets, as Putin continues to commit atrocities in Ukraine we must ratchet up the pressure on Russia and build on President Trump's decisive action.\"",
      "The leaders will discuss with Zelenskyy how to disincentivize China and India from buying Russian energy at the discounted prices Moscow gives them. The profits from those sales go to help fund Russia's \"war machine,\" as President Trump put it this week.",
      "Another focus will be on how to use Russian assets frozen by authorities in accounts across Europe to help fund Ukraine's defensive efforts. European authorities say there's as much as $250 billion in such Russian assets held within the EU.",
      "And the coalition summit's hosts will make their own specific announcements of additional support on Friday, with Starmer vowing to speed up delivery of more missiles to Ukraine.",
      "Starmer \"will announce that a U.K. missile building program has been accelerated to deliver more than 100 extra air defense missiles ahead of schedule to bolster Ukraine's defenses through the depths of winter,\" according to the statement from the British government.",
      "The additional missiles are part of a wider deal announced in the spring between the U.K. defense industry and Ukraine's government, worth about $2.1 billion, that will see Britain provide \"more than 5,000 lightweight-multirole missiles (LMM) to support Ukraine's defense,\" the U.K. government statement said.",
      "The laser-guided missiles have a relatively short range, up to about five miles, and they are intended to help Ukraine defend its airspace more than for offense.",
      "Zelenskyy has been pushing for months to get both his European and U.S. partners to supply more long-range missiles, too, but President Trump declined to grant him his biggest wish from Washington during his visit there last week: Tomahawk missiles. With a range of about 1,000 miles, the weapons in the hands of Ukrainian forces would easily be capable of reaching Moscow, and beyond.",
      "The Ukrainian leader says such long range Western missiles \u2014 and the greenlight to use them to target deeper inside Russia \u2014 are vital if his country is to stop the relentless airstrikes that continue to kill civilians on a near daily basis.",
      "With Mr. Trump's push for a ceasefire deal frustrated and going nowhere fast, both Ukraine and Russia continue launching daily attacks. Russia's strikes often hit civilian infrastructure, and they have killed at least six people, including two young children, in the recent days alone, according to Zelenskyy.",
      "Russian authorities say a Ukrainian drone struck an apartment building on the outskirts of Moscow before dawn on Friday, meanwhile, purportedly wounding five people, including one child.",
      "But for the European leaders gathered and calling into London on Friday, the impetus to heap pressure on Putin is growing fast, not only due to his military's daily barrage in Ukraine, but because of Russia's ramped-up probing of NATO defenses.",
      "Lithuania's leader said two Russian fighter jets breached its airspace \u2014 NATO airspace \u2014   again on Thursday night. NATO scrambled two Spanish fighter jets stationed in the Baltics in response.",
      "President Gitanas Naus\u0117da called it \"a blatant breach of international law and territorial integrity of Lithuania. Once again, it confirms the importance of strengthening European air defense readiness.\"",
      "Russia rejected the accusation, saying its jets conducted \"scheduled training flights\" over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, but that they \"neither deviated from the flight route, nor violated the borders of other countries.\"",
      "But it was just the latest in a series of unclaimed, but suspected Russian drone and other aircraft incursions into NATO's European airspace.",
      "Starmer was due to hold a joint news conference with Zelenskyy later Friday in London. CBS News' partner network BBC News said Keir was likely to urge his fellow European leaders on Friday to ramp up the provision of long-range weapons to Ukraine, following a successful Ukrainian attack on a chemical plant in Bryansk, Russia, using British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, earlier this week.",

      "Separate bear attacks in Japan killed one and injured four on Friday, officials said, days after the government vowed to toughen measures because of a record year of deadly assaults by the animals.",
      "Before Friday's attacks, bears had killed a record nine people this year, surpassing the previous high of six in the fiscal year that ended in March 2024.",
      "The animal has been increasingly encroaching into Japan's towns due to factors ranging from a declining human population to climate change.",
      "In a mountainous village in the northern region of Akita, police received a report of a bear mauling on Friday involving four people.",
      "\"One died and three are being treated at a hospital\" after the attack, a local police officer told AFP.",
      "Public broadcaster NHK and other local media reported that two of those hurt were doing farm work at the time of the attack, while the other two were injured as they went to help.",
      "A local hunter reportedly killed a bear nearby, and police are investigating if it is the one that attacked the four.",
      "In a separate incident in central Toyama region, an official told AFP \"a woman in her 70s was injured in a bear attack\" on Friday.",
      "This week Japan's new environment minister vowed to get tough on bears, calling the attacks \"a serious problem.\"",
      "\"We are committed to further strengthening various measures including securing and training government hunters and managing the bear population,\" the minister said.",
      "In one of the previous fatal attacks, a 60-year-old went missing earlier this month while cleaning an open-air bath in northern Iwate prefecture, an environment ministry official told AFP.",
      "Bears have attacked tourists, entered stores and appeared near schools and parks, particularly in northern regions. In August, a\u00a0hiker in northern Japan\u00a0tried to fight off a bear but was pulled into the nearby woods where he was found dead.",

      "Thousands of bears are shot every year.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",

    "story": [
      "As many as 48 bags containing human remains were discovered and recovered from a clandestine grave near Guadalajara, Mexican authorities said Thursday.",
      "Guadalajara is the capital of Jalisco state, where one of Mexico's most violent and powerful drug cartels operates and where thousands of people have been reported missing.",
      "The bags with the remains were located four weeks ago by a search group on a vacant lot in Zapopan, a vast outlying municipality in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, the state prosecutor's office said.",
      "Officials said they were still trying to pin down an exact number for victims whose remains were found in the bags. They declined to give an estimate, but said they were carrying on with a search to see if more remains were around.",
      "\"We need to make progress on the forensic issue so that we can tell you how many victims this number of bags represents,\" Blanca Trujillo, deputy state prosecutor for missing persons, told a press conference.",
      "In the meantime, the remains in the 48 bags that were recovered would need to be analyzed, officials said.",
      "Since the grisly discovery, authorities have been working to recover the remains with the support of members of the Guerreros Buscadores collective.",
      "In presenting an official report on the search efforts, Trujillo said her office had the support of the National Commission for the Search for Persons. Because of the vastness of the land, the search has required the use of heavy machinery, she said.",
      "Hundreds of mass graves discovered",
      "The discovery of the grave site adds to dozens of similar cases in Jalisco, the state hardest hit by the crisis of missing persons affecting Mexico, where more than 127,000 victims have vanished nationwide.",
      "The vast majority of disappearances have occurred within the framework of intensified violence that has shaken Mexico since December 2006, when the federal government launched an anti-drug military operation.",
      "One of the\u00a0largest mass graves in Mexico\u00a0was reported in 2017 when more than 250 skulls were found in what appeared to be a drug cartel mass burial ground on the outskirts of the city of Veracruz.",
      "More recently, last June, forensic experts located the remains of 34 people buried near a residential area in Zapopan. In January, at least\u00a056 bodies\u00a0were discovered in unmarked mass graves in northern Mexico, not far from the U.S. border.",
      "According to official data, Jalisco has more than 15,900 cases of missing persons, a toll that experts attribute to the activities of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).",
      "Last February, the United States designated the CJNG as a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" after identifying it as one of the main organized criminal groups trafficking fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans.",
      "CJNG has been accused of using fake job advertisements to lure new members and of\u00a0torturing and killing recruits\u00a0who resist. In March, a group of people looking for missing relatives found\u00a0charred bones, shoes and clothing\u00a0at a suspected training ground for the cartel.",
      "The cartel is led by Nemesio Rub\u00e9n Oseguera Cervantes, who is better known as\u00a0\"El Mencho.\"\u00a0Washington has offered a\u00a0$15 million reward\u00a0for information leading to his capture.",

      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

      "With less than two weeks before critical elections across the country, Democrats have tough questions to grapple with in terms of their messaging and whether they can navigate the growing movement in their party that is embracing or downplaying political violence, attorney and political commentator Kaitlin Puccio told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"We do hear a lot of just the Democrats are against Trump, but we don't hear a lot of what they're actually for, which is problematic and it kind of seems to me like they don't really have a cohesive message,\" Puccio,\u00a0adjunct professor at Fordham Law and\u00a0the Director of the Art and Bioethics Initiative of the UNESCO Chair in Bioethics and Human Rights, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",

But we don't have a king. We all know that. We're not supposed to take this phrase literally, but what about the policies that are in place right now, do you think are authoritarian? And what do you want instead? So we're hearing a lot of slogans and phrases and kind of catch phrases. And really that leaves the message without substance.\"",

Look at what they've done or tried to do to John Fetterman. When he tries to think for himself instead of having the party tell him what to think, they ostracize him.

      "Puccio told Fox News Digital that Platner's apology seemed to show remorse compared to the reaction from Jones, which could serve as a blueprint going forward on how Democrats can acknowledge past mistakes.",
      "\"The point is that every situation has to be evaluated separately, but the conversation still has to be had over what to do within our Democratic Party about this violent rhetoric, which is, it's basically being accepted right now,\" Puccio said. \"What we're about to see, I don't know how long it's going to take, but I do think there's going to be a shift toward the middle because I think there is going to be a realization that we are leaving out and by we, I mean, all Americans in general were forgetting from both sides of the political aisle about the middle.\"",
      "While Democrats are expected to perform strongly in next year's midterms, given that, historically, the party not in power does well in those elections, Republicans have been closing the gap in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections being held in early November, which could send a signal that Democrats aren't in as strong of a position as many experts think.",

      "In nearly every modern conflict, disabling enemy aircraft on the ground has been the first move. When Israel struck Iranian nuclear sites earlier this year, it began by destroying Iranian runways \u2014 grounding Tehran\u2019s air force before it could take off. Russia and Ukraine have done the same throughout their ongoing war, targeting airfields to cripple enemy aircraft. And when India clashed with Pakistan, the opening salvos hit Pakistani air bases.",

Shield AI, based in San Diego, has unveiled a new AI-piloted fighter jet designed to operate without runways, without GPS, and without constant communication links \u2014 an aircraft that can think, fly, and fight on its own.",
      "Shield AI says the jet, called X-BAT, can take off vertically, reach 50,000 feet, fly more than 2,000 nautical miles, and execute strike or air defense missions using an onboard autonomy system known as Hivemind. It\u2019s designed to operate from ships, small islands, or improvised sites \u2014 places where traditional jets can\u2019t. The aircraft\u2019s dash speed remains classified.",
      "\"China has built this anti-access aerial denial bubble that holds our runways at risk,\" said Armor Harris, Shield AI\u2019s senior vice president of aircraft engineering, in an interview with Fox News. \"They\u2019ve basically said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to compete stealth-on-stealth in the air \u2014 we\u2019ll target your aircraft before they even get off the ground.\u2019\"",
      "The jet launches vertically, and three X-BATs can fit in the space of one legacy fighter or helicopter.",
      "According to Harris, the U.S. has spent decades perfecting stealth and survivability in the air while leaving its forces vulnerable on the ground. \"The way to solve that problem is mobility,\" he said. \"You\u2019re always moving around. This is the only VTOL fighter being built today.\"",
      "X-BAT\u2019s Hivemind autonomy allows it to operate in denied or jammed environments, where traditional aircraft would be blind. The system uses onboard sensors to interpret its surroundings, reroute around threats, and identify targets in real time. \"It\u2019s reading and reacting to the situation around it,\" Harris said. \"It\u2019s not flying a pre-programmed route. If new threats appear, it can reroute itself or identify targets and then ask a human for permission to engage.\"",
      "That human element, he emphasized, remains essential. \"It\u2019s very important to us that a human is always involved in making the use of lethal force decision,\" Harris said. \"That doesn\u2019t mean the person has to be in the cockpit \u2014 it could be remote or delegated through tasking \u2014 but there will always be a human decision-maker.\"",

      "Shield AI says X-BAT will be combat-ready by 2029 and is designed to deliver fifth- or sixth-generation performance at a small fraction of the cost of manned fighters. The aircraft\u2019s compact footprint allows up to three X-BATs to fit in the deck space of a single legacy fighter or helicopter, giving commanders more flexibility in launching sorties from limited space.",

      "While Shield AI isn\u2019t disclosing specific numbers, the company says X-BAT is priced in the same range as the Air Force\u2019s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, the next generation of autonomous wingmen meant to fly alongside \u2014 and eventually ahead of \u2014 manned fighters. Costs vary depending on mission systems and configurations, but the company\u2019s goal is to scale production to keep the jet affordable and sustainable throughout its lifecycle, breaking what it calls the traditional \"fighter cost curve.\"",
      "The company estimates the aircraft will deliver about a tenfold improvement in cost per effect compared to legacy fifth-generation jets, including the F-35, while remaining \"affordable and attritable\" enough to be risked in high-end combat.",
      "Designed with a potential Indo-Pacific conflict in mind, which would require maneuverability on small island chains.\u00a0 (Shield AI\u00a0)",
      "Shield AI is in discussions with both the Air Force and Navy about integrating X-BAT into future combat programs and with several allied militaries exploring joint development opportunities.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Harris said the company views X-BAT as part of a generational shift toward distributed airpower \u2014 one that mirrors what SpaceX did in space. \"Historically, the United States had a small number of extremely capable, extremely expensive satellites,\" he said. \"Then you had SpaceX come along and put up hundreds of smaller, cheaper ones. The same thing is happening in air power. There\u2019s always going to be a role for manned platforms, but over time, unmanned systems will outnumber them ten-to-one or twenty-to-one.\"",
      "For Harris, that shift is about restoring deterrence through flexibility. \"X-BAT presents an asymmetric dilemma to an adversary like China,\" he said. \"They don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from, and the cost of countering it is high. It\u2019s an important part of a broader joint force that becomes significantly more lethal."

    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo has a theory on why Democrats want the Epstein files released and explains why nobody should mess with Cardi B on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "In her posthumous memoir, Virginia Giuffre recounts being groomed as a teenager and sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 writing that the abuse included rape by an unnamed prime minister and encounters with powerful men such as former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump.",
      "The book, \"Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,\" was released Tuesday and garnered global attention. While it made no explicit allegations against Clinton or Trump, Giuffre did chronicle meetings with both in contexts not related to Epstein's alleged crimes.",
      "The story Giuffre recounts of how she was sucked into Epstein and Maxwell's high-powered orbit begins when her father helped get her a job at Mar-a-Lago, where he worked as a maintenance worker. Giuffrie's discussions of Trump in the book largely place him as a background figure during her early days at Mar-a-Lago, where she eventually met Maxwell in the summer of 2000.",

      "Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, had her memoir released posthumously.\u00a0 (Cassie Basford)",
      "\"It couldn\u2019t have been more than a few days before my dad said he wanted to introduce me to Mr. Trump himself. They weren\u2019t friends, exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that\u2014I\u2019d seen photos of them posing together, shaking hands,\" Giuffre writes. \"Trump couldn\u2019t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. 'Do you like kids?' he asked. 'Do you babysit at all?' He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends, many of whom had children that needed tending.\"",
      "Giuffre also recounts how Epstein and Trump's relationship eventually broke down, an explanation for which differs from the one Trump has publicly provided. Giuffre said Trump withdrew Epstein's membership at Mar-a-Lago after hitting the teenage daughter of another guest, but Trump has publicly said that a spat about Epstein coaxing his Mar-a-Lago spa employees was what led to the end of their relationship.",
      "Giuffre, working an entry-level position at the resort's spa, recounted how Maxwell sought to hire her as a masseuse despite her lack of experience. Before she knew it, Giuffre was traveling alongside Epstein and Maxwell around the world performing sexual favors. According to Giuffre, it was difficult to reconcile the fact that her abusers commanded so much respect from such powerful figures.",
      "\"This was a man who displayed framed photographs of himself with the Dalai Lama, with the pope, and with members of the British royal family. A photo in his Palm Beach house showed Epstein posing behind the podium of the White House briefing room,\" Giuffre writes. \"This was a man who\u2019d had former president Bill Clinton over for dinner (I was at the table that night) and who\u2019d hosted Al and Tipper Gore as well (again, I was there).\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW VIEWED SEX WITH TEENAGE VIRGINIA GIUFFRE AS HIS 'BIRTHRIGHT', NEW MEMOIR CLAIMS",
      "\"Maxwell was proud of her friendships with famous people, especially men,\" Giuffre added in the memoir. \"[Maxwell] loved to talk about how easily she could get former president Bill Clinton on the phone.\" According to Giuffre, Epstein and Maxwell visited the White House together during Clinton's tenure in the Oval Office. In the book, Giuffre also recalled how Clinton flew on Epstein's plane in 2002, but she was not present for that trip.",
      "Bill Clinton was among the high-powered people in disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's orbit, according to a new memoir released by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. (Photos by: Alex Kent and Rick Friedman/Getty Images)",
      "\"On September 21, Epstein and Maxwell were leaving New York on an extended trip to Africa. Marcinkova was flying with them on Epstein's Boeing 727, as were several high-profile guests: the actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey and former president Clinton, not to mention six U.S. Secret Service agents. (Clinton has said the trip was a humanitarian mission that included stops related to the work of his foundation.)\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "However, despite naming Clinton in the book about her experience being sex trafficked by Epstein, Giuffre lamented the media's propensity to connect the former president to Epstein's crimes. \"Right away, the article noted that I had never been \u2018lent out\u2019 to the former president. But I guess the Mail found it newsworthy simply that I\u2019d witnessed Epstein and Clinton together,\" she writes.",
      "Among the various trafficking incidents Giuffre talked about in her book, which do directly involve powerful people from Epstein and Maxwell's orbit, was a brutal rape by an unnamed former prime minister on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2002. According to Giuffre's account of the incident, she was ordered by Epstein to have sex with the prime minister, who choked her nearly to unconsciousness and mocked her fear of the situation. Giuffre said that upon returning to Epstein after the incident, she begged not to be sent back to the prime minister, but Epstein told her the brutality was just part of the job.",
      "According to Giuffre, this horrific incident was a turning point for her.",

      "\"Before the Prime Minister\u2019s attack, Epstein had me fooled. I thought that Epstein\u2019s predilection for childlike girls was a sickness, but that, in his twisted way, he meant well. After the attack, I couldn\u2019t stay a fool. Having been treated so brutally and then seeing Epstein\u2019s callous reaction to how terrorized I felt, I had to accept that Epstein meted out praise merely as a manipulation to keep me subservient. Epstein cared only about Epstein,\" Giuffre writes in her memoir. \"At that point, I hit bottom. I now knew I wouldn\u2019t survive. I saw only two possible options: either someone Epstein trafficked me to would kill me or I would take my own life.\"",
      "Giuffre would eventually die by suicide in April, roughly six months before the release of her memoir."

During that first election cycle, according to The Washington Free Beacon, Ossoff raised 60% of his contributions from outside the state of Georgia.",

      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "More than 1 million patients have been affected by a data breach involving SimonMed Imaging, one of the country's largest outpatient radiology and medical imaging providers. The breach came to light after a cyberattack compromised sensitive patient data, with reports indicating that ransomware operators may have been behind the incident. What makes this case particularly concerning is the scale of the attack and the type of information stolen, which could easily be misused for financial or identity fraud.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",
      "Unfortunately, the attackers had already gained access. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5, 2025, cybercriminals exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to around 1.2 million individuals. The Medusa ransomware group later claimed responsibility, alleging they had stolen more than 200 GB of data, including patient IDs, financial records and medical scans.",
      "DISCORD CONFIRMS VENDOR BREACH EXPOSED USER IDS IN RANSOM PLOT",
      "SimonMed Imaging discovered suspicious network activity in January 2025, prompting an immediate security response and system lockdown. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The attackers reportedly demanded 1 million dollars to delete the stolen files, or 10,000 dollars per day to delay publishing. SimonMed was later removed from the Medusa leak site, which could suggest a ransom payment, although the company has not confirmed this. In the aftermath, SimonMed brought in cybersecurity experts to investigate and has offered complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.",

      "Hackers linked to the Medusa ransomware group stole data from 1.2 million patients, including IDs, financial details and medical scans. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data got exposed in the SimonMed breach",
      "While SimonMed's official filing described the exposed data as names and other data elements, the ransomware group's claims suggest a much broader leak. According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces. Identity details and medical records are often sold in bulk to fraud operators who use them to commit financial scams, insurance fraud, or obtain prescription drugs. Medical breaches are harder to recover from because you cannot reset or replace a medical history or a government ID scan the same way you can change a password.",
      "We reached out to SimonMed for comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "DELIVERY GIANT'S DATA BREACH EXPOSES 40,000 PERSONAL RECORDS",
      "After the breach, SimonMed hired cybersecurity experts, tightened defenses and offered free credit monitoring to affected individuals.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay protected",
      "Even though the company is offering free credit monitoring, leaked data often circulates long after an incident is closed publicly. That is why it is important to take additional precautions on your end to reduce the long-term impact of this breach and future-proof your personal security.",
      "People-search sites collect personal records and make them publicly accessible. Data removal services handle outreach and removals on your behalf, which reduces your exposed footprint online. With less information easily available, it becomes harder for attackers to assemble a complete identity profile for scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If you have ever interacted with SimonMed or any related platform, change your passwords immediately. Avoid reusing old passwords across different accounts. A password manager helps generate strong credentials and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them manually. This reduces the risk of one breach affecting multiple accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Enabling 2FA adds an important layer of verification to your accounts. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they will not be able to log in without the code delivered to your phone or app. It is one of the simplest and most effective security upgrades you can make.",
      "Modern malware includes remote access tools and silent monitoring modules that can stay hidden before launching an attack. Strong antivirus software can detect unusual behavior, protect against ransomware and alert you in real time if something attempts to access your data without permission. This is no longer just about traditional virus protection but active threat monitoring.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and potentially access your private information is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Regularly review your bank statements, insurance records and medical billing activity. Cybercriminals often test stolen information with small, easily overlooked transactions before moving to larger fraud attempts. Catching and reporting these early can prevent a much bigger loss.",
      "Because breaches involving medical providers often expose sensitive identifiers, an identity protection service can be useful. These services scan dark web listings, alert you when your information appears in leaked databases and assist with recovery if fraud occurs. Some plans include legal support and help with credit restoration.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "After a major breach, attackers often launch phishing campaigns that reference the affected company to appear legitimate. Be skeptical of emails or texts mentioning SimonMed or credit monitoring, especially if they request payment or personal verification. Staying aware of current scams and keeping your software updated adds a strong layer of defense.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The SimonMed Imaging breach is another reminder that cyberattacks on healthcare providers are becoming more frequent and far more invasive. Once data is taken, it can circulate indefinitely across criminal networks. Taking protective steps early, including monitoring your identity and reducing your exposed data online, can help you stay ahead of potential misuse.",

These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks. While WEEX operates as a legitimate platform, scammers often exploit the name of real exchanges to sound credible. They'll encourage victims to \"trade gold\" through what seems like an official account but actually directs them to fake sites or wallets designed to steal money.",
      "Why this could be a scam",
      "John's experience shows several red flags. The conversation began with a friendly invitation, then quickly shifted to a financial pitch. That's a classic move in online relationship scams.

      "One day, we might see glowing cities of glass scattered across the Moon's surface, shining softly under Earth's light. NASA is teaming up with Skyeports, a California-based company, to explore how lunar dust could be turned into massive glass spheres strong enough to live in.

      "Turning moon dust into homes",
      "Skyeports has developed a way to transform lunar dust, known as regolith, into durable glass that can be shaped into massive spheres. Using a microwave furnace, the regolith melts and expands like a bubble before cooling into a hard, transparent shell. These spheres could one day serve as living and working spaces for astronauts.",
      "The innovation lies in building directly on the Moon using local materials. No costly shipments from Earth are required. The same pipes used to blow the molten glass will become entrances, while 3D printers inside the spheres will create furniture and fittings using lunar materials.",

      "Self-healing and solar-powered living",
      "The planned glass spheres go far beyond simple shelters. They are designed as self-sustaining ecosystems. The glass can repair small cracks caused by micrometeorites or moonquakes, and built-in solar panels will allow each habitat to generate its own energy.",
      "Inside, temperature layers could create condensation to support plant growth. This would produce oxygen, water and food, making each sphere a self-contained life-support system.",
      "The science behind the glass sphere design",
      "The spherical shape is more than a design choice. It evenly distributes pressure, giving the structure incredible strength. By adding elements like titanium, magnesium and calcium, the glass becomes even tougher and stronger than steel.",
      "Dr. Martin Bermudez, CEO of Skyeports, shared that current prototypes are only a few inches wide, but future spheres could stretch up to 1,640 feet across. His long-term vision is a network of glass cities connected by transparent bridges across the lunar landscape.",

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy. Once you install the app, it drops a malware strain called Klopatra. It's a new and highly sophisticated Android malware currently being used in active campaigns targeting financial institutions and their customers.",
      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Fake VPN apps can hide dangerous malware that steals your data and money. (iStock)",
      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",
      "The infection chain is carefully planned. It starts with social engineering, tricking you into downloading and installing the app from outside the official Play Store. From there, Klopatra bypasses Android's built-in protections and reaches deep into the system to gain persistence and control.",

Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",
      "When fake apps like Mobdro are combined with these weaknesses, users are left exposed.

      "Only download VPNs, streaming services and apps from Google Play, Apple App Store or the official developer's website. Avoid links in forums, social media messages or emails promising free content.",

      "An Ohio lawmaker is taking aim at artificial intelligence in a way few expected. Rep. Thaddeus Claggett has introduced House Bill 469, which would make it illegal for AI systems to be treated like people. The proposal would officially label them as\u00a0\"nonsentient entities,\" cutting off any path toward legal personhood.",
      "And yes, it also includes a ban on marrying AI.",
      "Claggett, a Republican from Licking County and chair of the House Technology and Innovation Committee, said the measure is meant to keep humans firmly in control of machines. He says that as AI systems begin to act more like humans, the law must draw a clear line between person and program.",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute.

      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture.

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",
      "CHATGPT MAY ALERT POLICE ON SUICIDAL TEENS",
      "How to prompt for accuracy without being a jerk",

      "Start with the goal.\u00a0Tell the model what you want right away. Include the format and any limits up front so it knows where to focus.Get specific.\u00a0Use numbers instead of vague words. \"Write three bullet points\" works better than \"Write a few ideas.\"Add a check.

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",
      "So, how should you use this in real life?",
      "The findings might sound odd, but they offer a clear takeaway for anyone who uses AI tools daily. Here's how to put them into practice.",

Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord.

      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month.

      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",

First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord.

      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

      "When chatbots cross the line",
      "Some AI systems meant to help can actually cause harm. Therapists have warned that chatbots sometimes break their own safety rules and give dangerous advice to teens in distress. Some have been caught encouraging self-harm, giving diet tips for eating disorders or pretending to be romantic partners.

    "summary": "Thieves used a stolen truck-mounted moving lift to scale the Louvre and steal royal jewels worth over $100 million in a lightning-fast Paris heist.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot has the details on how thieves pulled off the bold crime.",
      "The thieves behind the daring Louvre Museum heist in Paris, France, appear to have used a truck-mounted moving lift \u2014 the kind professional movers use to hoist furniture up to apartment windows \u2014 in order to scale the building\u2019s second floor, according to Laure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor.",
      "The burglars pretended they were hiring the freight lift for a move and when the equipment owner or representative arrived to verify the job, the suspects threatened that person, forcing them to hand it over and leave the scene, Beccuau said in an interview with RTL radio, according to The New York Times.",
      "Authorities said the thieves spent less than four minutes inside the Louvre on Sunday morning. They allegedly wheeled the vehicle to the Seine-facing fa\u00e7ade, a window was forced open and two vitrines were smashed.",
      "The thieves made away with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense. The heist has prompted a national reckoning, with some officials comparing the shock to the 2019\u00a0burning of Notre-Dame cathedral.",
      "They also stole an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s second wife, and a reliquary brooch. Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s diamond diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch \u2014 an imperial ensemble of rare craftsmanship \u2014 were also part of the loot.",

      "Beccuau said the stolen items were valued at around $102.1 million and that the team investigating the heist has grown to 100 people.",
      "The pieces were not insured, which is not uncommon for state collections because of the prohibitive costs, the Times reported, citing France\u2019s culture ministry. The ministry reportedly said that the state \"acts as its own insurer\" when works are in their usual place of conservation \"given the cost of taking out insurance\" and the fact that \"the accident rate is low.\"",

      "Beccuau told local media that investigators believe the robbers may have been commissioned by a collector or were purely motivated by the value of the jewels and precious metals, Reuters reported.",
      "\"We\u2019re looking at the hypothesis of\u00a0organized crime,\" Beccuau told BFMTV, noting that the thieves could be professionals operating on spec for a buyer.",
      "Beccuau added that if a collector did commission the heist, there is hope that the stolen pieces will remain intact and well-preserved until recovered, the outlet reported. If the thieves acted independently, they may have targeted the jewels for their potential use in laundering criminal proceeds.",
      "\"Nowadays, anything can be linked to\u00a0drug trafficking, given the significant sums of money obtained from\u00a0drug trafficking,\" Beccuau said, according to Reuters.",

      "\"The terms of the 20 point plan that the president put out there is very clear. It's supported not just by Israel, by, but by all of our Gulf Arab friends. It's that Hamas has to disarm. It's that Hamas has to actually behave itself and that Hamas, while all the fighters can be given some sort of clemency, they're not going to be able to kill each other, and they're not going to be able to kill their fellow Palestinians,\" Vance said.",
      "\"Right now, where I stand, I feel confident that we're going to be in a place where this peace lasts, where it's durable, and if Hamas doesn't cooperate, then, as the United States has said, Hamas is going to be obliterated,\" Vance added.",

      "During a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday, Trump said that Hamas would be eradicated if it did not hold up its end of the deal. The president issued similar warnings since the peace deal went into effect last week.",
      "In addition to his warning to Hamas, Vance scolded the media over its apparent \"desire to root for failure,\" saying that any setbacks or hiccups did not necessarily mean the end of the deal.",
      "\"Every time something bad happens and every time that there's an act of violence, there's this inclination to say, \u2018Oh, this is the end of the ceasefire. This is the end of the peace plan.\u2019 It's not the end. It is, in fact, exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time. We are doing very well. We are in a very good place,\" Vance said before praising the team working to implement the Gaza deal.",

We know that Hamas has to comply with the deal, and if Hamas doesn't comply with the deal, very bad things are going to happen.

      "As Britain marked the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birth last week,\u00a0Japan made history of its own on Tuesday by electing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a self-declared admirer of the \"Iron Lady.\"",
      "Takaichi, 64, who has long cited Thatcher as a personal and political inspiration, was chosen by Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), during an extraordinary session of the country's lower house, replacing former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ending several months of political turbulence that saw the party lose its upper-house majority in July.",
      "In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt \"the tough work starts here\" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan\u2019s security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher\u2019s \"strength and womanly warmth\" as qualities she seeks to emulate. In 2013, shortly before Thatcher\u2019s death, Takaichi met her in London \u2014 a moment she later described as \"life-changing.\"",

      "Economically, she praises Abenomics, the policies adopted by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and favors fiscal and monetary stimulus. Abe was Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and was assassinated in 2022 at a campaign rally, two years after leaving office.",
      "\"She\u2019s very different from the other people in the Liberal Democratic Party, and that\u2019s why she was selected this time,\" said Gordon Chang, author and Asia analyst, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital. \"After losing its upper-house majority, the LDP realized it needed to protect its right flank by electing someone more conservative than in the past \u2014 so the Margaret Thatcher comparison does make sense.\"",
      "Known for her hawkish stance\u00a0on China, Takaichi is expected to maintain Japan\u2019s close alignment with the United States. Chang said her election could bolster Washington\u2019s strategic position in Asia, especially as tensions with Beijing remain high.",

      "Takaichi\u2019s rise has been hailed as a milestone for female representation, though Chang emphasized that her selection was driven more by ideology than identity.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think she was chosen because she was a woman,\" he said. \"She was chosen because the party needed to shore up its right flank \u2014 and it just so happened that the most conservative of the possible candidates was a woman.\"",

    "summary": "People familiar with pardon discussions told NBC News that top White House officials became concerned about attempts from outsiders to profit from the clemency process.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As soon as Donald Trump took office for his second term, he began using his clemency power at a steady clip. It started with the pardons of the roughly 1,500 criminal defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and continued each month, with more pardons or commutations.",
      "At the end of May, he had issued 73 clemency actions, not including all the Jan. 6 defendants. Trump once called the power to pardon \u201ca beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou got to get it right,\u201d he told reporters during his first term.",
      "But after May, the pardons stopped.",
      "Four people familiar with discussions around pardons told NBC News that top White House officials became concerned about attempts from outsiders to profit from the clemency process, and two of those people said the White House paused on Trump issuing pardons in order to get more control over matters. These people, like others in this story, were granted anonymity to speak candidly. Another factor has been the president\u2019s crowded agenda, which included foreign and domestic priorities, one of those people said.",
      "Two senior White House officials said chief of staff Susie Wiles, who has played a central role in reviewing pardons, became more outspoken after reports emerged that lobbyists and consultants were advertising themselves as offering access to Trump\u2019s pardon authority for steep prices.",
      "Those officials said Wiles pushed back hard against these efforts and tightened the process to distance it from those attempting to broker influences. While it\u2019s legal to engage lobbyists on these issues, Wiles didn\u2019t like the look. That meant making clear to those on the outside that she would not tolerate people trying to profit from the clemency process, one of the senior White House officials said.",
      "\u201cChief of staff Wiles does not mess around, especially when it comes to outsiders wrongly tossing around proximity to the president to gain fortune and favor,\u201d this person said.",
      "Urgency grew after Bloomberg reported in August that two intermediaries seeking to cash in on a burgeoning pardon economy were floating a plan to Roger Ver, a man known as Bitcoin Jesus for his early crypto evangelism, to secure a presidential pardon for him in exchange for $30 million. The White House denied any knowledge of the plan to Bloomberg.",
      "The report set off alarms inside the White House, the two White House officials and two others familiar with the discussions told NBC News. Last week, Ver reached a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve the federal tax charges brought against him. He has not yet been granted a pardon.",
      "In late May, NBC News also reported that some lobbyists had received proposals as high as $5 million to press cases before the president. More recently, an associate of former Sen. Bob Menendez, who is accused of bribing the senator with gold bars, paid $1 million to a Washington lobbyist with ties to Trump to help secure clemency, three sources told NBC New York. Lobbying disclosure filings described the payment as for \u201cexecutive relief.\u201d",
      "Clemency actions picked up again this month.",
      "Last week, Trump commuted the seven-year prison sentence of former New York Rep. George Santos, with the timing of the move surprising even some close allies. Trump granted another pardon this week, for Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of crypto currency exchange Binance, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. Binance has ties to World Liberty Financial, which has administered many of the Trump family\u2019s crypto projects.",
      "A pardon was not certain; Zhao\u2019s lawyers had received conflicting signals, at times believing it would happen and other times not, a person familiar with the discussions said. In confirming Zhao\u2019s pardon, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Zhao had been unfairly prosecuted by then-President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, declaring that \u201c[t]he Biden Administration\u2019s war on crypto is over.\u201d",
      "The Zhao pardon came after Trump met with Wiles and White House Counsel David Warrington on Monday again to review a new slate of candidates. The senior White House official said more people are poised for relief once the president has an opportunity to sign them.",
      "A person familiar with the discussions said that now, Wiles \u201cis at least controlling the timing\u201d of pardons.",
      "Others seeking relief from the president include Pras Michel, a member of the Fugees who was convicted in 2023 in a foreign lobbying and campaign finance case, according to one of the people familiar with the discussions. This person said they believe Michel is likely to receive a pardon once the president\u2019s signings pick back up again.",
      "According to the two senior White House officials, clemency requests are received and reviewed by the White House counsel\u2019s office, with Warrington briefing Wiles before the two meet with Trump to present a slate of candidates for the president\u2019s consideration. Alice Johnson, who became a prominent advocate for criminal justice reform after Trump commuted her life sentence during his first term and now serves as the president\u2019s \u201cpardon czar,\u201d advises the process, focusing on drug-related cases, among others, one of the officials said. The Justice Department also sends pardon requests to the White House counsel.",
      "Trump\u2019s pardons have faced plenty of criticism, including, at times, from his own allies.",
      "Santos was released from prison this week after serving just months into his seven-year sentence. Last year, he pleaded guilty to charges of committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. His short time in political life was plagued by accusations of campaign finance violations and lying about his qualifications. Republican lawmakers who voted to expel Santos from Congress spoke out after Trump commuted Santos\u2019 sentence.",
      "\u201cThe President has the discretion to commute sentences for people convicted of federal crimes. In this case, Santos willingly pled guilty to these crimes and then complained about having to serve his sentence,\u201d Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., said. \u201cThe victims of his crimes still have not been made whole, including the people he stole from and the voters he defrauded. He has shown no remorse. The less than three months that he spent in prison is not justice.\u201d",
      "Presidents largely have unchecked pardon power, and past presidents have also faced criticism for using it to assist allies. Biden received blowback, including from many Democrats, for issuing pre-emptive pardons for his family on his way out of office. But Trump has issued far more pardons at a consistent pace, with many going to allies or well-connected individuals.",
      "After Trump pardoned a Virginia sheriff convicted of bribery, who was a supporter of the president, Trump\u2019s pardon attorney, Ed Martin, posted on X: \u201cNo MAGA left behind.\u201d",
      "\u201cPolicy-wise, Trump is one of the few presidents who tried to commit to doing these pardons regularly,\u201d one of the sources familiar with the discussions said. This person and another close to the White House said they expected the process to resume with pardons issued on symbolic dates \u2014 Juneteenth, July 4, Labor Day or before the start of the government shutdown \u2014 but it never did. The delay was not strictly due to concerns around conflicts of interest, one of the senior White House officials said, but also the president\u2019s lack of signing time.",
      "Trump\u2019s clemency decisions have included well-known figures and political allies \u2014 such as former reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, as well as former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was once a contestant on Trump\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d TV show  \u2014 and people whose cases revisit questions about political persecution and fairness \u2014 including a group of anti-abortion protesters and Devon Archer, a former business partner of Hunter Biden who spoke out against the former president\u2019s son.",
      "Marc Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minnesota who is an expert on clemency, said every president favors certain types of cases. With Barack Obama, it was narcotics defendants, and with Trump, it\u2019s white-collar cases.",
      "\u201cWhat merits examination is the process being used right now. Like Biden at the end of his term, Trump appears to be using an informal, closed and opaque process to evaluate petitioners (or those like George Santos who did not even file a petition), while ignoring the thousands of people who followed the rules and submitted a clemency petition through the pardon attorney,\u201d Osler said. \u201cI agree with Trump that the old evaluation system for clemency needed to be demolished; but now it needs to be remade into something accessible, fair, transparent and lasting.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said that \u201cthe Trump White House takes this process and responsibility extremely seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cEach clemency request is intensely vetted and reviewed, and President Trump ultimately makes every clemency decision,\u201d she added.",
      "After speculation rose this week, the White House said there have not been discussions of clemency for Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who was convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but was acquitted on more damning charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. Combs\u2019 lawyers have previously told NBC News they have been pursuing a pardon for their client.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been no paper pushed on it,\u201d one of the White House officials said, referring to the formal vetting process required for clemency applications.",
      "Trump has occasionally declined to go forward on recommended cases, a senior White House official said, and sometimes requests additional information before making a final decision.",
      "The president has been outspoken granting clemency to those he believes were treated unfairly by the justice system, and seekers have found success in drawing attention to their treatment. When Trump commuted Santos\u2019 sentence, he remarked on the \u201clong stretches of time\u201d the former congressman had spent in solitary confinement, saying Santos, \u201cby all accounts, has been horribly mistreated.\u201d",
      "Recognizing Trump\u2019s instincts for what he views as deliverance, one of the people familiar with discussions expressed hope that Trump would not extend similar leniency to  Combs, who was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. On Oct. 3, a federal judge sentenced Diddy to 50 months in prison.",
      "\u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t pardon Diddy,\u201d this person said. \u201cBut I could see him doing it because he might think he\u2019s served enough.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested he was angling for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, even as the White House has said that no meeting is planned.",
      "\u201cYou know, they don\u2019t have a lot of telephone service,\u201d Trump said, before urging reporters to \u201cput out the word.\u201d",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, Trump is scheduled to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before attending a working dinner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders. Malaysia, this year\u2019s ASEAN chair, has set \u201cinclusivity and sustainability\u201d as the summit theme.",
      "The White House said Trump will also join a signing ceremony for a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, whose deadly border conflict he has claimed credit for helping to resolve. During his first term, Trump attended the annual ASEAN summit only once.",
      "Sandwiched between the summit in Kuala Lumpur and South Korea\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, Trump will pay an official visit to Japan, his fourth, for talks with the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and an audience with Japanese Emperor Naruhito.",
      "Takaichi, a conservative protege of the late Shinzo Abe, has pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by March, two years ahead of schedule, a target likely to draw praise from Trump, who has pressed for allies to spend more. She has also raised the idea of revisiting the U.S.-Japan trade deal announced in July.",
      "Trump and Abe forged a close personal relationship during his first term, before Abe\u2019s assassination in 2022. Trump will also meet with business executives and visit American troops while in Japan, a country that hosts more U.S. service members than any other in the world.",
      "In South Korea on Wednesday, Trump is slated to address business leaders at APEC, hold a bilateral meeting with the president and attend a leaders dinner that evening.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the U.S. president coming to Asia to meet the multilateral schedule; it\u2019s the U.S. president coming to Asia and then bending the multilateral schedule around his schedule,\u201d said Cha, noting Trump is skipping the U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting, the East Asia Summit and formal APEC sessions. Even so, Cha said, regional leaders are eager to engage.",
      "\u201cEverybody still wants to cut a deal with the U.S. president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want tariff relief, and they will try to make a deal to achieve that.\u201d",
      "Central to the trip is Trump\u2019s anticipated meeting with Xi in South Korea on Thursday, though Beijing has not yet confirmed the session. Top officials from the U.S. and China are sitting down in Malaysia on Saturday to find a way forward after Trump threatened new tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods and other trade limits starting on Nov. 1 in response to China\u2019s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "Trump has said he plans to raise the issue of fentanyl, accusing China of failing to curb the flow of precursor chemicals, and a senior administration official said China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil will also be on the table. Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including soybean purchases.",
      "Both leaders want the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the meeting planning said.",
      "Analysts urged caution about what a leader-level encounter can deliver. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first term, high-level exchanges with China did not prevent him from later taking a harder line,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy. \u201cSo the symbolic value of summit diplomacy should not be overstated.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, a senior administration official pushed back on speculation that Trump could reprise his 2019 encounter with North Korean\u2019s Kim, when he made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas in an effort to revive nuclear talks that had collapsed. Trump said before leaving Washington on Friday that he \u201cwould like\u201d to meet with Kim, but was unsure whether it would happen on this trip.",

      "Craig Melvin wears his heart on his sleeve \u2014 and his taste buds on his face.",
      "Asked if he can name the best thing he\u2019s ever eaten during a TODAY Food segment, Craig visibly flips through his Rolodex of memories, finally shaking his head.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because every month or two, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d he says, his eyes lighting up.",
      "He\u2019s getting ready to guide an audience through a cooking demo at the TODAY Fan Fest event Taste of TODAY, hosted at Platform by the James Beard Foundation.",
      "Also in attendance, a slew of super-fans watch TODAY Food segments happen in real life, mingle with the anchors and world-class chefs, and enjoy bites from the demos.",
      "\u201cWe had some Korean fried chicken this morning; she\u2019s here tonight,\u201d Craig says of chef Judy Joo and her recipe. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the most amazing Korean fried chicken I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u201d",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Craig adds that earlier in the week, chef Brian Lewis prepared his Herbed Pork Roast during the 3rd Hour, and he thought the same thing: \u201cOh, my God, this is the best pork I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he remembers.",
      "Sheinelle Jones has a similar reaction to another one of Lewis\u2019 dishes that day: the Roasted Beet and Burrata Salad.",
      "\u201cIt was like a beet salad, but it\u2019s not just any beet salad,\u201d she says, waving her hands in the air, emphatically. \u201cIt had fennel and pistachio. It was, like, amazing.\u201d",
      "Alongside anchors Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Dylan Dreyer, three chefs make their dishes from the \u201cTODAY Loves Food\u201d cookbook. While sampling those foods, attendees are also being served wine, beer and cocktails like Savannah\u2019s Savanita, provided by Diageo, Rockaway Brewing Company and Brooklyn Winery.",
      "On the menu tonight: Ayesha Nurdjaja\u2019s Chicken Shawarma with White Sauce, David Rose\u2019s Ancho Grilled Skirt Steak with Chipotle Chimichurri and Katie Lee Biegel\u2019s Chopped Dill Pickle Salad, all  prepared live for the audience by each chef.",
      "Craig says his favorite thing about food segments is the expertise on display.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the quality of food,\u201d he says, especially from culinary stars like Siri Daly, Edy Massih and Priyanka Naik, who are all in attendance.\u2029\u201cThe untold part of the TODAY Food story is the TODAY Food team, and they just do a remarkable job.\u201d",
      "He enjoys most things he eats on the show, but every now and again, he tries a dish that\u2019s not his thing \u2014 and his face makes that clear.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t hide it,\u201d Craig admits.",
      "\u201cMy mother has said the same thing. But, listen, I\u2019ll try anything,\u201d he says, adding that not everything is for everyone. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better.\u201d",
      "Sheinelle says she\u2019s taken home food from the show that she really enjoyed, but it\u2019s not always a hit with her kids.",
      "\u201cMy kids don\u2019t like their food to touch, so they\u2019re still in the like, \u2018We like chicken, we like potatoes,\u2019 so sometimes I\u2019ll bring something home, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u201d",
      "But the easiest way to tell if an anchor enjoyed the dish is to take a look at their plate at the end of the segment. If it\u2019s empty, it was a hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m called out on a lot on how much food I\u2019m eating,\u201d Dylan says during the event\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cWhen you\u2019re surrounded by the best-of-the best chefs, you want to taste their food.",
      "\u201cAnd then my mom\u2019s texting me after, \u2018Was that really as good as you made it sound? Should I try that recipe?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yes, you have to try that recipe.\u2019\u201d"

Meanwhile Clara, heartbroken by the death of her father and aunt, embarks on a relationship with Miller (Mason Thames), a boy from her school.",

      "Although never explicitly confirmed, it is implied for the rest of the film that Elijah is actually Chris' biological child.",

Jonah does not see Elijah for a few days, until Clara \u2014 whom Morgan has intentionally kept in the dark about her father and aunt's affair \u2014\u00a0shows up to his house and tells him to go and get his child back.",
      "Jonah realizes that even if he is not Elijah's biological father, he loves him and wants to raise him as his son. Jonah runs to Morgan's house and apologizes for leaving Elijah and promises to never leave again.",
      "As Morgan supports Jonah with Elijah, their close friendship from high school resumes and gradually turns romantic. Eventually, it's revealed that when they were teenagers, Jonah had asked Morgan if \"they had it wrong,\" implying he thought he and Morgan were supposed to be together, instead of Morgan and Chris, and Jenny and Jonah.",
      "Does Clara Find out About the Affair?",
      "One of the first scenes of the movie establishes the close relationship between Clara and her aunt Jenny. While running late for family dinner, Clara calls Jenny to tell her a story about Miller, a boy from school who later becomes her boyfriend. She ends the call by saying, \"Don't tell my mom.\"",
      "Their mother-daughter relationship is also strained by Clara\u2019s dreams of studying acting, which Morgan doesn\u2019t believe is a responsible choice.",
      "So when Morgan uncovers the affair, she tells Jonah that Clara can never find out about it, as she does not want to ruin Clara's memories of her dad and aunt.",
      "When Clara arrives home one evening and walks in on Morgan and Jonah sharing their first kiss, she storms into her room upset. Unaware of their shared history, Clara assumes that her mom and her aunt's fianc\u00e9 had moved on.",
      "Clara avoids her mother for a few days, until one morning when Morgan helps her overcome a hangover. As they are sitting at the kitchen table, Morgan finally reveals to Clara that Chris and Jenny had been having an affair.",
      "How Does 'Regretting You' End?",

      "Miller announces he has been accepted off the waitlist to a film school, the same school Clara plans to attend for their acting program the next year.",
      "Miller and Clara are overjoyed to be attending the same college, and he plays a short film that he made for Clara. In the film, Miller shows videos of him and Clara from the past year, and he asks Clara to be his date to prom.",
      "After the film, Morgan pulls Clara aside to say she supports her dream to study acting in college, despite her initial doubts. Morgan tells Clara she has an incredible talent, and that she will be able to succeed. The mother and daughter finally embrace."

I am scared that if we move in together now then that\u2019ll be it and we will never deal with the question of conversion because we won\u2019t have to and I will be unhappy and maybe even resentful,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cYou made me feel like I was special, like you saw all the darkest parts of me and you found them endearing. And I don\u2019t know, it made me ignore things that I should\u2019ve paid attention to. And if I\u2019m being really honest with myself, Joanne\u2019s relationship made me rush into this with you and I wanted to catch up with her.

      "\u201cI think in Season 2, her journey is a real self-discovery journey. \u2018Are these the decisions I would\u2019ve made if we didn\u2019t just get pregnant with Miriam (Shiloh Bearman)?\u2019 And now I\u2019ve just been sort of on this high speed train of, \u2018This is how you live life if your mother-in-law\u2019s a nag, but you deal with her. And this and that and the other. And we have this daughter and she\u2019s gonna have the bat mitzvah and the whole thing,\u2019\u201d she explains.",

      "\u201cThere are 100 different ways I could convince you to be with me right now but I\u2019m not going to do that. Nothing good happens when it\u2019s forced. I don\u2019t want to be the person who\u2019s asking you to be someone different. We can\u2019t start our life that way. You would wake up in 20 years and hate me,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not giving up. It\u2019s accepting the truth of our situation,\u201d he replies.",
      "\u201cIs this happening right now? Are we breaking up right now?\" she asks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what other choice we have. I love you but we can\u2019t keep doing this. It\u2019s too hard,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cI feel like you have this idea of being Jewish that\u2019s so much more complicated than it really is. You feel Jewish to me. You\u2019re warm, cozy, you always want to chat about everything. You\u2019d be a pretty good get for us,\u201d Esther says.",
      "Fresh off a tough conversation with Sasha, Esther doubles down on her advice to Joanne, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re waiting for. Whether it\u2019s a sign or the waters to part or what. But the whole thing is just a feeling and enjoying all those little things is the feeling.\u201d",
      "In that moment, Joanne seems to finally get clarity.",
      "\u201cWith or without Noah, you\u2019re Jewish,\u201d Esther says.",
      "Joanne runs out to be with Noah at the same time he does. At first, they miss each other but then come face-to-face.",
      "\u201cNone of it matters. You are my soulmate. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Jewish. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not Jewish. I choose you every time,\u201d Noah says.",
      "\u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck,\u201d Joanne replies and they kiss.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Bell reflects on what was going on in Joanne's head as she spoke with Esther.",
      "\u201cSometimes all you need is someone in your life to point out a different framework, a different pair of glasses that you can look through, and all of a sudden, everything becomes clear,\u201d she said. \u201cPrior to that scene, Joanne was seeing conversion or Judaism as something so different from what she was and so far away from what she could attain.\u201d",
      "After talking with Esther, Joanne was able to see \u201cthat she\u2019s a lot closer to who she wants to be and what she wants than she previously thought.\u201d"

That\u2019s exactly how the experiment is supposed to work, so I would say not only is the experiment working, I think it\u2019s working better than ever,\" he said."

      "But there was a time when he wasn\u2019t sure he would be able to sing again following his operation in 2022. If his powerful vocals hadn\u2019t returned after the rehabilitation process, he said he would\u2019ve stopped performing.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like training for a marathon,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnyone can go for a run. Being able to go the distance is a whole different set of commitment. You have to physically, mentally and spiritually be ready to do that again.\u201d",
      "He faced some doubts along the way, but he never stopped pushing himself. Some days he\u2019d experience \u201ca little ray of hope,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe next day was brighter and until the next time, you know, you get punched in the nose by some setback. And you pick yourself up again and do it again,\u201d he continued.",
      "Bon Jovi revealed that the thought of taking the stage again is a little scary. But, he said he knows he\u2019ll have his band members, like pianist David Bryan and drummer Tico Torres, supporting him, as well as encouragement from their devoted fans.",
      "The tour will include songs from the band\u2019s upcoming collaboration album, \u201cForever (Legendary Edition),\u201d out Friday, Oct. 24.

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan elected hard-line conservative Sanae Takaichi as prime minister Tuesday, making her the first woman in modern times to lead the key U.S. ally.",
      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

    "summary": "In the space of just 7 minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",

      "Vice President JD Vance stressed Wednesday that U.S. officials were not seeking to babysit the Gaza Strip ceasefire and that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions rose over the next steps in the Middle East.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has hosted a string of senior American officials in recent days, exchanged words of friendship and optimism with Vance at a joint news conference in Jerusalem as Washington worked to ensure the truce brokered by President Donald Trump will hold.",
      "\u201cI never said it was easy, but what I am is optimistic that the ceasefire is going to hold and that we can actually build a better future in the entire Middle East,\u201d Vance said, speaking alongside Netanyahu.",
      "The vice president\u2019s visit followed the arrival of Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to follow Thursday and meet with Netanyahu on Friday, the Israeli government said.",
      "The vice president and the Israeli leader championed each other\u2019s efforts in securing the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on Oct. 10.",
      "But as a succession of U.S. representatives flocked to Israel this week after flares of violence threatened to undermine the ceasefire, Vance also appeared to seek to reassure the Israeli leader \u2014 and the world \u2014 that the U.S. wasn\u2019t looking to overstep.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a vassal state and that\u2019s not what Israel is. We don\u2019t want a client state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a partnership.\u201d",
      "He later clarified the role of the Americans in Israel this week as the ceasefire looked fragile and the path to the second phase of the deal appeared uncertain.",
      "It wasn\u2019t about \u201cmonitoring in the sense of, you know, you monitor a toddler. It\u2019s about monitoring in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of work, a lot a good people who are doing that work and it\u2019s important for the principles of the administration to keep on ensuring that our people are doing what we need them to do,\u201d Vance said.",
      "Netanyahu was asked by a reporter whether Israel was becoming a \"protectorate of the United States.\" He dismissed the idea as \"hogwash\" but maintained that \"we make the decisions for the security of Israel.\"",
      "The planned international security force in Gaza has loomed as a major question mark, with some in Israel concerned that such a force could limit its freedom to act in Gaza in the future.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that \u201cnumerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East,\u201d had \u201cexplicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force.\u201d",
      "He added that he had \u201ctold these countries, and Israel, \u2018NOT YET,\u2019\u201d but he warned that if Hamas did not \u201cdo what is right,\u201d or it violated the ceasefire agreement, the militant group could meet a \u201cFAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL\u201d end.",
      "The president did not directly reference the international security force that he envisions entering Gaza to help maintain peace in the territory in the future under his 20-point plan, but appeared to be referring to the initiative.",
      "Vance had said Tuesday that the international stabilization force envisioned by the president was still in its early planning stages, as he acknowledged that coordinating troops from different countries could be a difficult task."

      "After \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which counts Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara as executive producers, received a nearly 23-minute standing ovation at its Venice Film Festival premiere in September, filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania took a slew of meetings with potential North American distributors.",
      "Executives praised the film, which follows the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s failed attempt to save Hind, a Palestinian child  who was killed in Gaza in 2024 after being trapped in a car under Israeli fire. But not a single major studio or streamer made an offer on the movie, the official Oscar submission of the Tunisian Culture Ministry, Ben Hania said.",
      "\u201cPeople never say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid to pick up a movie,\u2019\u201d Ben Hania said. \u201cMaybe they are. I don\u2019t know. They can\u2019t openly talk about it, because it\u2019s a shame to be afraid of talking about the killing of a child.\u201d",
      "Four movies that tell stories about Palestinian people, set from 1936 to 2024, are competing for this year\u2019s Academy Award for best international feature, just as a ceasefire takes hold in the region. The films, \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d \u201cThe Sea,\u201d and \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d are screening for awards voters this fall. Three of them are slated to run at the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles this week.",
      "Despite interest at the start of filming, and in some cases A-list backers, none of these films have secured a deal with a major studio or streamer, which is uncommon when a title receives buzz overseas. In past years, other foreign language films about major conflicts in history, such as Brazil\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Germany\u2019s \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d and the United Kingdom's \u201cZone of Interest\u201d all found prominent distributors.",
      "As Hollywood has grown more outspoken in recent months about the situation in the Middle East, the challenges of convincing its distributors \u2014 the lifelines that can take movies from obscurity to national recognition \u2014 remain.",
      "The batch of movies arrives as the crisis in the Gaza Strip remains a flashpoint issue in the entertainment industry. More than 5,000 film and television professionals have signed on to a boycott of Israeli film institutions, while two studios, Paramount and Warner Bros.. have condemned the boycott. Just as some in Hollywood have worried about saying the wrong thing in a social media post or a red carpet interview, others have been vocal, like Javier Bardem, who wore a keffiyeh to the Emmy Awards in September and openly criticized the war in interviews on the red carpet, or Amy Schumer, who posted frequently on her Instagram account calling for the release of the Israeli hostages.",
      "Foreign films that get picked up for distribution often land with smaller independent companies, limiting the films to a few cities and small marketing budgets. International films have also long struggled with marketing to English-speaking audiences with non-English language films.",
      "Multiple distributors declined to comment on the record about why studios aren\u2019t buying the movies about Palestinians, but studio sources said either that their slates were already full or that the movies don\u2019t seem likely to draw large audiences to theaters.",
      "Without a major distributor, it can be hard for films from the region to demonstrate theatrical potential. But last year\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank, shows both an appetite among American audiences for Palestinian stories and the complex issues these films face.",
      "When \u201cNo Other Land\u201d failed to close a theatrical deal in North America, producers paid to release it in theaters themselves, collecting $2.5 million domestically, enough to make theirs the third highest grossing documentary of the year so far, after films featuring Taylor Swift and Led Zeppelin. The filmmakers then turned down an offer to stream on U.S. platforms from Mubi, citing the London company\u2019s backing from Sequoia Capital, which also invests in an Israeli defense tech startup called Kela. (In August, Mubi\u2019s CEO responded to backlash about Sequoia financing by saying that the profits Mubi generates \u201cdo not fund any other companies in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\u201d)",
      "For the filmmakers working in the region over the past two years, it\u2019s been a long, arduous road to reach audiences, as the war impacted their physical productions and made potential distributors wary of facing political backlash for releasing their films.",
      "Seeking to fill what they see as a void in the marketplace, Palestinian-American brothers and producers Hamza and Badi Ali formed their own company, Watermelon Pictures, in April 2024. The duo also tapped model Alana Hadid as Watermelon\u2019s creative director and unofficial brand ambassador.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we wish there was more competition,\u201d Hamza Ali  said. \u201cIt is almost like all of the pressure is on us to release these films and we feel obligated to do so. We hope that distributors of all sizes will start to engage.\u201d",
      "The Chicago-based company is distributing \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d submitted by the Royal Film Commission\u2013Jordan for Oscar consideration, and \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d submitted by the Palestinian Culture Ministry, both of which also received long ovations at film festivals and strong reviews from critics.",
      "Over a year since the company\u2019s launch, the Ali brothers said that when they meet with executives at larger studios and streamers about buying films on Palestinian people, the buyers defer to higher ranking executives, citing the sensitivity of the subject matter, and effectively ending any conversation about a deal.",
      "For some directors, the barriers have come from their own governments.",
      "In Israel, filmmaker Shai Carmeli-Pollack won the country\u2019s version of the Oscar for \u201cThe Sea,\u201d the Ophir Award, only to have the Israeli government condemn the film and pull funding for the organization that granted the award. Each country chooses its own film to submit for Oscar consideration, and in Israel, the winner of best film at the Ophir Awards is automatically the country\u2019s submission.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d said Carmeli-Pollack, whose film is about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who wants to join a school trip to the beach. \u201cI\u2019m not the first film that they attacked. In a way, they saved us a lot of explaining to the world that we do not represent this government.\u201d",
      "In a statement issued on social media in September regarding the decision, Israeli Culture Minister Miki Zohar wrote in Hebrew that he believes the country\u2019s taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to support a \u201cceremony that spits on the heroic Israeli soldiers. (The film features a soldier questioning a Palestinian boy and his father as they are trying to go to the beach).",
      "Carmeli-Pollack shot his movie in the West Bank in the summer of 2023, and he said he saw distributors\u2019 enthusiasm for it evaporate after the Oct. 7 attacks. \u201cThe Sea\u201d is now being released in the U.S. by Menemsha Films, a small Los Angeles-based company that distributes a variety of Jewish films.",
      "Stories shot in the Palestinian territories have always faced hurdles when it comes to securing locations, but the crisis in Gaza made physical production virtually impossible, directors who spoke to NBC News said.",
      "Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You,\u201d was scheduled to start shooting her film in October 2023 in Jericho. Plans changed after the Oct. 7, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which led Dabis to evacuate her cast and crew from the West Bank.",
      "\u201cWe were hearing fighter jets and cities were being sealed off, checkpoints were closing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought maybe we\u2019d come back to Palestine, things would blow over. We had no idea.\u201d",
      "We need to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to the masses.",
      "-Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You\"",
      "Dabis, whose movie she said is backed by a mix of European and Arab financing, ended up shooting in Greece, Cyprus and Jordan, telling the fraught history of the region through three generations of one family who were expelled from Jaffa in 1948.",
      "\u201cPalestine 36\u201d director Annemarie Jacir was also scheduled to shoot her historical drama in October 2023 in the West Bank, with a cast that includes British actor Jeremy Irons and Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass.",
      "But after Oct. 7, \u201cThere was no more insurance,\u201d Jacir said. \u201cNo agents were going to send any of their cast to Palestine to film.\u201d Jacir shot most of her movie in Jordan but was eventually able to return, with a much smaller crew, to film some scenes in Bethlehem, Jaffa and Jerusalem.",
      "In order to help their movies find wider audiences, some are enlisting high-profile Hollywood advocates.",
      "Dabis recruited Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, two of the entertainment industry\u2019s most outspoken figures on Gaza, as executive producers.",
      "\u201cGiven what we\u2019ve watched unfold in the last two years, we understand that we need to break out of any kind of echo chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to the masses.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 16, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce a narrowed list of 15 movies in contention for the international Oscar, ahead of the awards telecast March 15."

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 President Donald Trump arrives in Southeast Asia on Sunday for his first visit to the continent since returning to office, a three-nation tour through Malaysia, Japan and South Korea that is expected to culminate in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies tick higher.",
      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested he was angling for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, even as the White House has said that no meeting is planned.",
      "\u201cYou know, they don\u2019t have a lot of telephone service,\u201d Trump said, before urging reporters to \u201cput out the word.\u201d",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, Trump is scheduled to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before attending a working dinner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders. Malaysia, this year\u2019s ASEAN chair, has set \u201cinclusivity and sustainability\u201d as the summit theme.",
      "The White House said Trump will also join a signing ceremony for a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand, whose deadly border conflict he has claimed credit for helping to resolve. During his first term, Trump attended the annual ASEAN summit only once.",
      "Sandwiched between the summit in Kuala Lumpur and South Korea\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, Trump will pay an official visit to Japan, his fourth, for talks with the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and an audience with Japanese Emperor Naruhito.",
      "Takaichi, a conservative protege of the late Shinzo Abe, has pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by March, two years ahead of schedule, a target likely to draw praise from Trump, who has pressed for allies to spend more. She has also raised the idea of revisiting the U.S.-Japan trade deal announced in July.",
      "Trump and Abe forged a close personal relationship during his first term, before Abe\u2019s assassination in 2022. Trump will also meet with business executives and visit American troops while in Japan, a country that hosts more U.S. service members than any other in the world.",
      "In South Korea on Wednesday, Trump is slated to address business leaders at APEC, hold a bilateral meeting with the president and attend a leaders dinner that evening.",
      "Topping the agenda at every stop is trade, with negotiators still ironing out the details of pacts with South Korea and Japan and taking steps toward agreements with China and Malaysia. U.S. and Chinese delegations are meeting in Malaysia over the weekend ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the U.S. president coming to Asia to meet the multilateral schedule; it\u2019s the U.S. president coming to Asia and then bending the multilateral schedule around his schedule,\u201d said Cha, noting Trump is skipping the U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting, the East Asia Summit and formal APEC sessions. Even so, Cha said, regional leaders are eager to engage.",
      "\u201cEverybody still wants to cut a deal with the U.S. president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want tariff relief, and they will try to make a deal to achieve that.\u201d",
      "Central to the trip is Trump\u2019s anticipated meeting with Xi in South Korea on Thursday, though Beijing has not yet confirmed the session. Top officials from the U.S. and China are sitting down in Malaysia on Saturday to find a way forward after Trump threatened new tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods and other trade limits starting on Nov. 1 in response to China\u2019s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "Trump has said he plans to raise the issue of fentanyl, accusing China of failing to curb the flow of precursor chemicals, and a senior administration official said China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil will also be on the table. Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including soybean purchases.",
      "Both leaders want the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the meeting planning said.",
      "Analysts urged caution about what a leader-level encounter can deliver. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first term, high-level exchanges with China did not prevent him from later taking a harder line,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy. \u201cSo the symbolic value of summit diplomacy should not be overstated.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, a senior administration official pushed back on speculation that Trump could reprise his 2019 encounter with North Korean\u2019s Kim, when he made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas in an effort to revive nuclear talks that had collapsed. Trump said before leaving Washington on Friday that he \u201cwould like\u201d to meet with Kim, but was unsure whether it would happen on this trip.",
      "Kim says he will negotiate only if the U.S. recognizes North Korea as a nuclear power, and he has only further strengthened his weapons programs since Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cI think they are sort of a nuclear power,\u201d Trump said as he began his journey to Asia on Friday, perhaps paving the way for a possible meeting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of nuclear weapons. I\u2019ll say that.\u201d"

      "A boy who swallowed up to 100 high-powered magnets purchased online has undergone major surgery to remove them.",
      "After four days of stomach pain, the 13-year-old boy was admitted to Tauranga Hospital on New Zealand's North Island, where doctors discovered the magnets had joined together to form four chains inside his intestines.",
      "Surgeons extracted the magnets and removed parts of the boy's damaged intestines, according to a report by doctors at the hospital, published Friday in the New Zealand Medical Journal.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the report, had swallowed \u201capproximately 80\u2013100 5x2mm high-power neodymium magnets\u201d a week prior to his hospitalization, the doctors said. He was discharged after spending eight days in the hospital.",
      "New Zealand banned the sale of small, high-powered magnets in 2013, after the government warned that children could suffer serious injuries if they swallowed the magnets, whether out of curiosity or while playing with them as \u201cmock jewellery.\u201d",
      "\u201cThough these magnets tend to be marketed at adults as office toys and many brands carry strict safety warnings, it is clear from the cases here and overseas that they pose too great a risk to children,\u201d Simon Bridges, then New Zealand\u2019s consumer affairs minister, said in a statement at the time, citing previous child hospitalizations in the U.S. and Australia.",
      "However, the authors of the New Zealand Medical Journal report noted that enforcing the long-standing ban remains challenging, as the magnets can still be easily purchased through online marketplaces.",
      "\u201cWhile these laws can be enforced locally, it is more difficult to regulate products supplied by overseas merchants on large-scale online marketplaces,\u201d the authors said.",
      "\u201cThese platforms are easily accessible especially by children, with purchases being inexpensive and not always requiring age verification,\u201d they added.",
      "The report said that the magnets had been purchased via the Chinese online marketplace Temu. In a statement to NBC News, Temu said it has not yet been able to confirm whether the magnets in question were purchased through its platform.",
      "\u201cWe are sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery,\u201d Temu\u2019s spokespersons said.",
      "\u201cWe take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\u201d they said.",
      "The marketplace platform said it has reached out to the New Zealand Medical Journal for more details on the case, and its teams are reviewing relevant listings to ensure they meet local safety standards, adding that any noncompliant products will be removed and sellers found violating platform rules or local laws will face firm action."

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan tries to placate President Donald Trump amid contentious trade talks, officials may be eyeing an icon of American manufacturing that has virtually no presence there: The Ford F-150 pickup truck.",
      "Trump, who is visiting the key U.S. ally next week as part of his first trip to Asia since returning to office, has long criticized the lack of American vehicles sold in Japan, citing what he believes are non-tariff barriers.",
      "Japanese auto brands such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Subaru are ubiquitous in the United States, where Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). Cars are Japan\u2019s top export to the U.S., though according to JAMA most Japanese cars sold there are actually assembled in North America.",
      "By contrast, Japanese brands account for more than 90% of new cars sold in Japan, which imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association.",
      "The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more American cars, including as part of a trade deal announced in July that imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese autos and auto parts. A joint statement on the agreement published last month said Japan would allow vehicles built and certified for safety in the U.S. to be sold in the country without additional testing.",
      "In August, Trump suggested that there would soon be a market in Japan for American cars, specifically the Ford F-150.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re taking the very beautiful Ford 150, which does very well and I\u2019m sure will do very well there,\u201d he told CNBC. The model has long been the best-selling vehicle in America, according to industry outlets.",
      "Reuters reported this week that Ford F-150s were part of a purchase package being finalized to present to Trump during talks in Tokyo next week, citing two sources with knowledge of the preparations. It said the trucks might be used in Japan as snow plows.",
      "Local media in Japan have also said the government is considering buying the trucks.",
      "Japanese officials have not confirmed the reports, and the new trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, was not asked about them at his first news conference on Friday.",
      "Akazawa, who was previously Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator with the U.S., said earlier this month that while Trump\u2019s frequent mentions of the Ford F-150 suggested they were a \u201cfavorite\u201d of his, he did not have information to share on any potential purchases by the Japanese government.",
      "Despite the advocacy by Trump, large, expensive American cars have long been a hard sell in Japan, where roads are typically smaller and narrower than their American counterparts.",
      "\u201cFully-sized pickups simply wouldn\u2019t fit on Japanese roads and into the standard pay parking lots,\u201d Mike Smitka, a member of GERPISA, an international network dedicated to the global automobile industry, told NBC News.",
      "Many of the vehicles sold in Japan are mini or \u201ckei\u201d cars that are far smaller and more fuel efficient than the ones produced by American automakers. They are required by law to be no more than about 11.2 feet long and 4.9 feet wide, compared with the F-150 which is typically more than 17 feet long and 6.6 feet wide.",
      "European vehicles are also far more popular in Japan than American ones, accounting for more than 200,000 imports last year. The top-selling European car brand in Japan is Mercedes-Benz.",
      "\u201cUnlike European car companies, Ford and General Motors (GM) don\u2019t have dedicated port facilities or dealerships,\u201d Smitka said in emailed comments. \u201cThey\u2019d be very expensive to import, expensive to market, and because there\u2019s no network, expensive to service.\u201d",
      "Ford did not respond to an emailed request for comment. In 2016, the company said that it would close all operations in Japan, saying it had struggled to gain market share and saw \u201cno reasonable path to profitability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t try to sell pickups because they understand the market,\u201d Smitka said.",

    "summary": "Russia reacted with outrage after President Donald sanctioned Russian energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil.",
    "story": [
      "Russia reacted with outrage Thursday after the United States imposed substantial sanctions on its two largest oil companies, the first economic punishments slapped on Moscow by President Donald Trump during his second term.",
      "Experts said it remains to be seen, however, the extent to which this move may damage the Russian economy or Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine, as Trump hopes to pressure Moscow to halt its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Days after canceling a planned summit with Putin, citing a lack of progress in the negotiations, Trump took the major step by effectively blacklisting Rosneft and Lukoil.",
      "The announcement was welcomed by Kyiv and its European allies, which added their own new raft of sanctions on Moscow, earning the ire of Russian officials and the state-controlled media.",
      "Speaking to journalists at the Kremlin on Thursday, Putin called the sanctions an \"unfriendly act\" but quickly brushed off their likely impact. \"They are serious in nature and will have certain consequences, but they will not have a significant impact on the health of our economy,\" he said.",
      "Putin added that sanctions on Russian oil could lead to \"a sharp increase\" in gas prices across the world, adding: \"If you take into account the domestic political calendar in the United States, it is clear how sensitive some processes would be. Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",
      "Hawkish ex-President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, was more forthright in his criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cThe USA is our adversary, and their loquacious \u2018peacemaker\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning Trump \u2014 \u201chas now fully taken up the path of war with Russia,\u201d Medvedev wrote in a social media post.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added in a news briefing: \u201cIf the current U.S. administration decides to follow the example of its predecessors, who tried to pressure or force Russia to abandon its national interests through illegitimate sanctions, the outcome will be exactly the same: a failure, both politically at home and harmful to global economic stability.\u201d",
      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

      "LONDON \u2014 Music met medicine when a patient played a clarinet solo as she underwent brain surgery for Parkinson's disease and proved that the treatment was working in real time.",
      "Denise Bacon, 65, saw her finger movements improve instantly during four hours of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery \u2014 all while staying awake and performing on the musical instrument, London's King\u2019s College Hospital said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "The retired speech and language therapist was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2014, She has since suffered difficulties walking, swimming, dancing and playing her beloved clarinet as the  progressive neurological disorder that affects movement has taken hold of her body.",
      "To help Bacon get these abilities back, Keyoumars Ashkan, professor of neurosurgery, performed DBS on her, implanting electrodes in Bacon's brain and tracking her body\u2019s reaction in real time.",
      "\u201cStimulating electrodes are placed into the deep structures of the brain,\u201d Ashkan said in the hospital\u2019s news release, adding that it was \u201ca long-established procedure to improve motor symptoms in patients with movement disorders.\u201d",
      "Although the brain itself has no pain receptors, Bacon was given local anesthetic to numb her scalp and skull, as doctors made holes half the size of a small coin in her skull and implanted the stimulating electrodes inside.",
      "A pulse generator, similar to a pacemaker, was then connected to the electrodes to send targeted electrical signals to the brain.",
      "\u201cAs a keen clarinetist, it was suggested Denise bring her clarinet into the operating theatre to see whether the procedure would improve her ability to play, which was one of Denise\u2019s main goals for the surgery,\u201d Ashkan said.",
      "An amateur musician, Bacon played the instrument with the East Grinstead Concert Band until Parkinson\u2019s symptoms made it impossible for her to continue five years ago.",
      "However, as she played during the surgery, she noticed an immediate improvement in her hand movements.",
      "\u201cI remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with,\u201d she said in the news release.",
      "Brain surgeries usually require general anesthesia, but certain procedures require the patient to be awake so doctors can ensure they aren't damaging vital brain functions.",
      "It is not the first procedure of this kind to be performed by Ashkan at King\u2019s College Hospital. In 2020, a violinist played jazz classics as a tumor was removed from her brain.",
      "Bacon also said she had seen early progress in her walking and is now looking forward to returning to activities such as swimming and dancing.",
      "For the next 20 years, the chest-implanted pulse generator will help Bacon by constantly delivering electrical impulses, and giving her the chance to return to the hobbies and passions she loves, King\u2019s College Hospital said in the release."

      "The new \u201cK visa,\u201d which launched Oct. 1, aims to make it easier for the world\u2019s top young talents in science and technology to live and work longer in China as it vies with the United States for global dominance in the fields.",
      "The new category requires no job offer, with the only requirements being an as-yet-unspecified age cap and having at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in science, technology, engineering or math from a top Chinese or foreign university, or relevant teaching or research experience there.",
      "Though many of the details have yet to be announced, the new Chinese visa program is already drawing interest in India, where China is seen as an increasingly appealing destination amid warming relations and the Trump administration\u2019s surprise announcement last month that it is raising the fee for the equivalent H-1B worker visa to $100,000.",
      "Beijing\u2019s talent-friendly move could also give it a boost amid continuing trade tensions and tech rivalries with Washington, which has imposed export controls on chips and other advanced technology that are spurring China to develop its own.",
      "But the new visa scheme has not gone over so well with young job seekers in China, who face intense competition even as universities churn out millions of new graduates a year amid an economic slowdown. Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24, excluding students, was at 17.7% last month, according to government figures released Wednesday.",

      "\u201cChina already has an abundant, even surplus, supply of highly educated young talent,\u201d Geng wrote in a post on the popular social media platform Weibo. \u201cSince these local talented individuals aren\u2019t even fully employed yet, why do we need to bring in foreign bachelor-degree holders?\u201d",
      "Loosening restrictions",
      "Chinese work visas generally come with strict, complex requirements and allow limited stays for a small group of high-end applicants who are sponsored by employers. Immigrating to China is difficult, and there are many obstacles to living and working there long-term.",
      "Consequently, China is less attractive for foreign professionals than many advanced economies with skilled migration policies, experts say.",
      "Only about 950,000 foreigners work in China, making up just 0.12% of the country\u2019s labor force of about 775 million, according to the Chinese Science and Technology Ministry. In contrast, foreign-born workers accounted for more than 19% of the U.S. civilian work force in 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The new visa aims to loosen restrictions and enhance China\u2019s global appeal, promising more generous terms such as longer validity periods and multiple entries.",
      "Though China is a relative \u201clatecomer\u201d with this initiative, it represents an \u201cupgrade\u201d to China\u2019s existing talent schemes, said Liu Guofu, a law professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology.",
      "Notably, the new visa does not require employer sponsorship or invitation, resembling \u201cindependent skilled immigration,\u201d Liu said.",
      "However, Liu stressed that Beijing\u2019s new talent scheme, which was announced in early August, \u201cbears little direct relation\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s shake-up of the H-1B visa fees, which was announced several weeks later.",
      "With the visa\u2019s focus on early-career STEM talents, Beijing is pivoting away from repatriating Chinese scientists and selectively inviting senior foreign experts, said Denis Simon, a leading expert on U.S.-China science and technology affairs.",
      "\u201cBy codifying a youth-focused, flexible entry channel, Beijing is normalizing inbound STEM mobility as part of its innovation strategy,\u201d Simon said.",
      "It offers a \u201clower-friction alternative\u201d for foreign STEM talents who may be frustrated by the higher U.S. fee for H-1B visas, he added, noting that more than 70% of H-1B visa holders are from India.",
      "\u201cEven small diversions of applicants can shift the geography of labs and startups at the margin \u2014 precisely where innovation clusters are won,\u201d Simon said.",
      "Public backlash",
      "Beijing\u2019s K visa has been met with strong backlash on Chinese social media, where commenters complained of a lack of transparency and public discussion in policymaking.",
      "Matthew Ma, 18, a freshman majoring in integrated circuits in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d that he had read \u201cnothing\u201d about the new visa in the two months since it was announced.",
      "\u201cThe biggest misstep they took in this whole process was not giving out enough information in time,\u201d Ma said. \u201cAnd this is, I think, the major reason why people are so angry about this visa.\u201d",
      "Others are angered that the visa requires only an undergraduate STEM degree, saying that is setting the bar too low at a time when young people in China feel pressured to rack up advanced degrees in order to compete with their peers in the job market.",
      "Social media has also been flooded with racist and xenophobic comments, especially about Indians, amid fears that an influx of foreigners could erode national identity in China, where the population has fallen for the past three consecutive years.",
      "In a strongly worded editorial last month, China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper dismissed such concerns as \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cmisleading.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo secure its future, China must attract and utilize the best minds from around the globe,\u201d it said, noting that there is a projected shortage of nearly 30 million skilled workers in the country\u2019s key manufacturing sectors this year alone.",
      "\u201cSuch talents are in high demand, and the more we have, the better,\u201d it added. \u201cThe K visa is just to facilitate young foreign science and tech talents to work and live in China. It shouldn\u2019t be equated with immigration.\u201d"

      "The company \u201cproactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected \u2018scam centers,\u2019\u201d Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX\u2019s vice president of business operations, wrote on X late Tuesday.",

      "The SpaceX announcement came after Myanmar\u2019s military shut down a major online scam operation known as KK Park.",
      "According to state-run news outlet Myanma Alinn, the army seized 30 sets of Starlink terminals and detained nearly 2,200 people in the Monday raid on the cybercrime center outside Myawaddy, a major trading town in Myanmar\u2019s Kayin state.",
      "Myanmar, where the civilian government was overthrown in a military coup in 2021, is notorious for cybercrime. The Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in a civil war with various ethnic groups fighting the military, creating an almost lawless situation in many parts of the country and allowing scam operations to thrive.",
      "Workers in the scam compounds are often trafficked from third countries, usually under the pretense of a lucrative job offer, and then forced to scam people online with investment pitches or romantic ploys.",
      "Following international pressure, particularly from neighboring Thailand and China, whose nationals have also been trafficked to work in these compounds, the junta \u2014 working alongside the same armed ethnic groups it opposes \u2014 launched a massive operation in February and released hundreds of workers.",
      "The practice is also well documented in other countries around the region such as Cambodia, where the U.S. last week seized more than $14 billion in bitcoin and formally charged the chairman of a Cambodian conglomerate over his alleged involvement in a massive cryptocurrency scam.",
      "The U.S., along with the U.K., also sanctioned the company, which was declared a transnational criminal organization by the Treasury Department.",
      "Last year, Americans lost at least $10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, according to the Treasury Department, a 66% increase from the year before."
