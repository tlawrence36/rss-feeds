      "Faith-based films are gaining traction in Hollywood, with recent successes sparking renewed interest",
      "LOS ANGELES -- At the movies this fall, Josh O\u2019Connor plays a hot priest with a complicated past, Keanu Reeves is an angel who lost his wings and Elizabeth Olsen has a romantic dilemma in the afterlife.",
      "Hollywood, it seems, has found God.",
      "But it\u2019s not just starry big-budget Netflix films or A24 indies that are grappling with religion and its place in entertainment. In recent years, there\u2019s been an explosion of films and television made from a confessional perspective that evangelize or portray a particular faith, often Christianity, that have performed particularly well with audiences.",
      "There are animated biblical films from Angel, like the upcoming musical \u201cDavid,\u201d which the company said has already exceeded $14 million in theatrical pre-sale tickets ahead of its release this Friday, to docudramas like Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Saints.\u201d While episodes from Season 2 are still being released, the first season of the Fox Nation series, which premiered last year, was the most watched on the platform.",
      "\u201cThere has been a revival, a revolution of sorts, of spirituality and faith content,\u201d proclaimed Traci Blackwell, head of targeted content for Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, at a recent Variety event in Beverly Hills for faith and spirituality in entertainment. Earlier this year, Amazon premiered the first season of its own biblical drama, \u201cHouse of David,\u201d and gained exclusive U.S. streaming rights to \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d a massively popular drama series about the life of Jesus.",
      "Historically some faith-based entertainment has performed well at the box office \u2014 Mel Gibson\u2019s 2004 epic \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d was notoriously the highest-grossing R-rated film in the U.S. and Canada for two decades. But faith-based hits have been few and far between for most of this century.",
      "\u201cHollywood has taken a lot of criticism by those in the faith community for not providing films that speak to them, that reflect their values,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst, emphasizing the box-office potential of faith-based films.",
      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",
      "\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to watch it,\u201d recalled Angel CEO and co-founder Neal Harmon. \u201cPeople have this idea that faith means cheesy or preachy. And we had to break through that barrier.\u201d",
      "Once they did, it paid off. Since Fathom Entertainment began distributing \u201cThe Chosen\u201d theatrically in 2023, the series has grossed more than $116 million domestically.",
      "Though not a Christian company, Angel aims to distribute and market \u201cvalues-based entertainment\u201d that includes but is not limited to stories of faith. They\u2019ve released a host of religious films, with \u201cZero A.D.,\u201d a biblical epic about the Massacre of the Innocents recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, on the docket for 2026.",
      "Meanwhile, Lionsgate is set to premiere \u201cI Can Only Imagine 2\u201d in theaters February, a sequel to the 2018 biopic starring Dennis Quaid, which was one of the highest-grossing Christian films of all-time in the United States.",
      "Co-director Andrew Erwin said he noticed a \u201cmassive shift\u201d take place about five years ago, after years of disconnect between the demand for these kinds of films and Hollywood\u2019s willingness to make them.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, movie studios are really giving us a fair shake,\u201d he said, though he thinks the quality of the content was also a factor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the knowledge of how to do the filmmaking side of things. And so, I think the storytelling has gotten a lot better.\u201d",
      "Lionsgate is also set to distribute the first of Gibson\u2019s two-part sequel to \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d in 2027.",
      "Trying to define what counts as faith-based programming is a bit like trying to define what counts as pornography.",

      "Amanda Seyfried preaches celibacy and endures persecution in \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee,\u201d the musical biopic about the founder of the Shakers sect, in theaters Christmas. But in all the acclaim and Oscar buzz surrounding the film, there\u2019s little talk of its engagement with faith.",
      "Even Scorsese\u2019s 1988 \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d or filmmaker Paul Schrader\u2019s Oscar-nominated \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d which also stars Seyfried, are hardly thought of broadly as Christian films, despite the fact that both men have been outspoken about their respective traditions.",
      "\u201cThis film was his way of exploring his faith and exploring who his God is,\u201d Scorsese\u2019s daughter Francesca, who directed one of the episodes of \u201cThe Saints,\u201d said of \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ.\u201d",
      "Conversely, the people behind some of these recent projects resist them being called explicitly religious, even when audiences perceive them as such.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterize it so much as overtly Christian,\u201d Jonathan Roumie, who plays Jesus in \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d told The Associated Press last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical drama that centers on Jesus.\u201d",
      "For studios and filmmakers, acknowledging that a project is told from a religious perspective can be a double-edged sword.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re buying in on going to the movie theater for a faith-based movie, you know you\u2019re gonna have people around you who are really into the experience,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThe minute you say faith-based though, it kind of puts a movie in a box.\u201d",
      "Many Christians celebrate the trend beyond its monetary potential. Phil Wickham, a Grammy-nominated Christian recording artist who voices the character of David in the upcoming Angel film, said it\u2019s been gratifying to see the success of shows like \u201cThe Chosen\u201d and \u201cHouse of David.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, anything that was Christian media felt so preachy,\u201d Wickham said. \u201cEven as a pastor\u2019s kid, it was a turn off. But now I think there\u2019s just more opportunity to tell bigger stories over the course of a series and more people willing to really dig in and tell something with excellence and beauty.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s too soon to tell whether there's been a sea change in Hollywood or if it's a short-term fad, the success of some of these projects has stood out amid an otherwise perilous time in the business.",
      "\u201cHollywood usually follows money,\u201d Jason Klarman, Fox News Media\u2019s chief digital and marketing officer, said as he touted Fox Nation\u2019s packed slate of upcoming faith-based content, including Zachary Levi's \u201cDavid: King of Israel\u201d docudrama. \u201cEven when the trend ends, we\u2019ll still be doing it.\"",

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

      "Horror stories were popular on radio in the late '30s, Bak says. Williams first thought of radio plays as an \u201cexercise,\u201d but he would eventually take them more seriously. While writing \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d he was already haunted by the mental health struggles of his sister, Rose, who would later inspire the fragile Laura Wingfield of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Williams would long explore the idea of madness, Bak says, and how we respond to people who seem to see things \u201cno one else can see.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- The ongoing strike at the Louvre is no longer just a labor dispute. It has become a test of how securely, credibly and competently the world\u2019s most visited museum is being run.",
      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",
      "The October daylight robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels, intensified scrutiny from lawmakers and auditors and reframing workplace complaints as questions of institutional failure.",

      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",
      "French senators were told last week that thieves who stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million escaped the Louvre with barely 30 seconds to spare, a detail that crystallized the scale of the breakdown.",
      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",
      "When the alarm finally sounded, police were initially sent to the wrong location, investigators said, a delay that proved decisive.",

A court audit flagged considerable delays in deploying modern security equipment and found that only a fraction of allocated funds had been spent on safety.",

      "Alex Warren's song \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025",
      "New York -- It jolted the winter, came alive in the spring, dominated the summer and went three-times platinum in the fall. Alex Warren's bombastic ballad \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025. It's also an unusual hit: slower than a traditional song of the summer, full of gloss, an ascendent hook and inoffensive, religious-adjacent lyricism.",
      "For those reasons, \u201cOrdinary\u201d has fast-tracked the 25-year-old singer/songwriter into mainstream musical fame, coming to a head in November when he earned his first Grammy nomination. The nomination for best new artist arrived just four months after the release of his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI bawled in my wife's arms,\u201d he said of the moment he found out about the nomination. For those who didn't believe in his music career, he says, \u201cthe biggest justification ever was the nomination.\u201d",
      "Most know Warren for \u201cOrdinary,\u201d but fame is not new for him. Before the chart-topping hit, Warren made a name for himself as a social media prankster in the TikTok collective \u201cHype House.\u201d And while that past might seem at odds with his new public persona, Warren always exuded perspicacity, the result of a troubled childhood that separated him from his comedic cohort. His father died of cancer when he was 9, he says, and his mother of complications due to alcoholism. A period of homelessness followed in his teens, before the TikTok fame.",
      "Still, he's remained curious and playful. At The Associated Press headquarters in New York, he chatted with staff and made disarming, self-deprecating comments.

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China\u2019s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",

The film deals with themes of Palestinian displacement and personal loss.",

      "Dabis, born and raised in the United States to Palestinian-Jordanian parents, said her passion and inspiration to become a filmmaker grew from a lack of authentic Arab and Palestinian representation in Western media. \u201cI became aware that I wanted to go into storytelling in order to tell our authentic stories, because I couldn\u2019t find us anywhere,\u201d she said.",
      "She said growing up in the U.S. offered better opportunities for a career in cinema than the Arab world, but the racism her family faced reinforced her desire to challenge harmful stereotypes. \u201cMy experience in the diaspora is really what compelled me to become a storyteller,\u201d she said.",
      "And she still struggled to be taken seriously, feeling pressure to adopt a more authoritative, even masculine tone to counter assumptions about women directors. \"There is this image of women filmmakers as overly emotional or unable to command a set,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us felt we had to overcome these unfair ideas.\u201d",

When one of the granddaughters suddenly disappears in the desert, the film follows the search for her across southern Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ameen traces her passion for filmmaking back to her childhood, inspired by the historical television dramas that once dominated Arab screens. \u201cI felt that as Arabs, we need to make our voices heard by ourselves, not have someone else speak on our behalf,\" she said.",

      "\u201cAbsorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller. There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to \u2018mockumentary\u2019 to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him.

      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s 2025 word of the year is \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwith a key\u201d \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",

      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake\u2019s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",

      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material.

      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- When actor Amy Baik was cast in a South Korean commercial last year, she thought she had landed a promising gig.",
      "But after filming wrapped, she was shocked to learn that both the director and advertiser had cut her scenes \u2014 not because of her performance, but because she lacked a facial feature prized in South Korean beauty standards.",
      "\u201cThe reason was that I don\u2019t have double eyelids,\u201d said Baik, 26.",
      "\u201cAfter receiving that feedback, I started to reconsider what kind of appearance Korea wants,\" she said, adding it \"made me wonder how I can survive as an actor in South Korea.\u201d",

The global success of \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cMinari\u201d and \u201cSquid Game\u201d has opened doors for South Korean performers in Hollywood \u2014 and spawned a cottage industry of consultants helping actors navigate American casting.",
      "\u201cHollywood\u2019s the dream (...) the ultimate pinnacle of acting accolades,\u201d said Julia Kim, a Korean American casting director who worked on \u201cMinari,\u201d Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cButterfly\u201d and \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "While established stars like Park Hae-soo and Lee Byung-hun have both South Korean and American representation, most aspiring Korean actors lack such connections. That gap is what talent agencies like Los Angeles-based Upstage Entertainment are trying to bridge.",

She attributes that shift partly to the global popularity of South Korean entertainment.",
      "Still, stereotypes persist. \u201cThe one that irritates me is the nerdy tech programmer,\" Dumbell said. \u201cSometimes I just won\u2019t even submit my actor for that because I know that they\u2019re much more nuanced as actors.\u201d",
      "For most South Korean actors without connections or know-how, Hollywood is still uncharted territory.",
      "Kim, who typically casts high-profile stars and works with local casting directors for co-productions, also finds actors via social media. \u201cI usually put out an open call on my Instagram,\u201d she said.",
      "But for actors without major agency backing, the right contacts are hard to find. The American and Korean industries operate differently, and U.S. casting information rarely reaches those outside established networks.",
      "Kim said South Korean talent faces a steep learning curve. \u201cI would get questions \u2014 should I change my Korean name to a Western name? Do I pay to get an agent? Can I look into the camera when I\u2019m doing an audition?\u201d she said. Even name consistency is an issue: Kim recalled a K-pop artist turned actor whose name appeared five different ways online.",
      "Technical standards also differ. Actor Misun Youm noted American audition tapes require clean white backgrounds, while \u201cin Korea, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "Headshots diverge too: South Korean profiles feature modellike images, while American headshots match character types.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, you shoot profile photos like a fashion magazine model,\u201d said veteran actor Shin Ju-hwan, who goes by Julian Shin. He played a masked soldier in second and third seasons of \u201cSquid Game,\" and stars in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d Season 3.",
      "Shin found Upstage by chance \u2014 his wife, a producer, discovered them on LinkedIn.",
      "His Hollywood dream was partly motivated by colleagues at his former agency \u2014 Han Yeri in \u201cMinari\u201d and Jung Ho-yeon in \u201cSquid Game.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though I wasn\u2019t a main character \u2014 I was just a \u2018soldier\u2019 \u2014 people who saw even that brief appearance started leaving comments on my Instagram,\u201d Shin said. \u201cThe impact of that show was truly unparalleled.\u201d",

      "The 22-year-old rapper, whose real name is Kevin Perez, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman, who criticized Perez for sending the wrong message to his young peers by glorifying violence during a less-than-18-month stretch from 2020 to 2021 that prosecutors said left dozens of people on Bronx streets shot at, injured or killed.",
      "\u201cYou taunted, you celebrated and you helped create a cycle of violence,\u201d Liman said, noting that Perez bragged on social media that he was exonerated on the top count and wrote \u201cKILL ALL RATS\u201d on Instagram after a trial in which gang members testified against him.",
      "The judge called Perez a \u201cman of promise\u201d but said a lengthy prison sentence was necessary for four separate shootings that injured multiple people while he led a gang known as \u201cSev Side/DOA.\u201d Perez was convicted in March of charges including racketeering conspiracy and attempted murder.",
      "Perez insisted that he had changed, saying: \u201cWhat I was at 18 is not what I am today.\u201d",
      "Saying everyone deserves a second chance, he added: \u201cI was just a kid. Didn't really know better.\u201d",
      "But Liman criticized him for not expressing any concern for his victims.",
      "\u201cTo date, you've shown no real remorse for your conduct,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Perez was named Billboard Magazine\u2019s R&B/Hip-Hop Rookie of the Month in November, 2021, following the release of his first album: \u201cThe D.O.A. Tape.\u201d It put him on the map as a newcomer in New York's drill rap scene, which features performers who wield weapons and lyrics containing slang about violence.",

      "In their sentencing brief, prosecutors wrote that Perez signed with a music label and used violence to further his career.",
      "\u201cThe music that had glorified gang violence made the defendant famous and now rich,\u201d they wrote, accusing Perez of encouraging violence through private messages.",
      "Defense attorney Michael Ashley, who asked the judge to levy the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, said his client grew up in one of the nation's most dangerous neighborhoods and fell under the influence of an older man who encouraged gang activity.",
      "The judge said he took into consideration that the crimes occurred while Perez's brain was \u201cstill evolving and maturing\u201d and that six of his friends died from gun violence before he turned 18.",
      "\u201cThe life of the street, it seems to me, is all you've ever known,\u201d Liman said.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Missouri's top prosecutor said China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on a roughly $25 billion court judgment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said Tuesday in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Wuhan. The Chinese government also is seeking compensation equivalent to $50.5 billion plus legal fees and the right to claim further compensation.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",
      "Last month, Missouri escalated its efforts to collect, asking the U.S. State Department to formally notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment.",
      "Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of the new case. But he said the earlier Missouri lawsuit was \u201ca purely politically motivated maneuver.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes it, will never accept it, and reserves the right to take strong countermeasures,\u201d Pengyu said.",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier this year that its actions during the pandemic aren\u2019t subject to U.S. jurisdiction and it doesn\u2019t recognize the ruling.",

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed the lawsuit in 2022, saying Missouri couldn\u2019t sue China, its Communist Party and seven other government or scientific agencies. But an appeals court allowed one part of the lawsuit to proceed: the allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment, such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.",
      "After Chinese officials didn\u2019t respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri\u2019s estimate of past and potential future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until it\u2019s collected.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, an ally of President Donald Trump who subsequently won election to the U.S. Senate, and alleged that Chinese officials were to blame for the pandemic. It was carried on by Attorney General Andrew Bailey, another Trump ally who resigned in September to become co-deputy director of the FBI.",

      "The complaint accuses Missouri, as well as Schmitt and Bailey, of \u201cfabricating enormous disinformation, and spreading stigmatizing and discriminating slanders\u201d that have harmed China's reputation.",
      "Schmitt said he would wear the suit \u201clike a badge of honor\u201d and accused Chinese authorities of \u201cattempting to absolve themselves of all wrongdoing in the early days of the pandemic.\u201d",

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet.

      "But he had no choice, and so his daily drudgery began. Each morning, he wakes at 7 and walks for half an hour to the factory to pick up the treats. Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",
      "There are boys like Arfan all over the camps, selling food they\u2019re desperate to eat and collecting trash in exchange for cash, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, skin seared by the sun.",
      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",
      "\u201cI feel shame working,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the time I should be studying.\u201d",
      "Each night when the sun sets, Arfan packs up and heads back to his shelter. And it is here where he lies on a mat on the bamboo floor, crying himself to sleep and pining for the life he was forced to leave behind.",
      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was taught that God is merciful and compassionate, and so must we be,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis includes permitting a merciful option to those facing the unimaginable and searching for comfort in their final months in this life.\u201d",

The request would then have to be approved by the person\u2019s attending physician as well as a consulting physician.",
      "The governor said the bill's sponsors and legislative leaders have agreed to add provisions to require confirmation from a medical doctor that the person \u201ctruly had less than six months to live,\u201d along with confirmation from a psychologist or psychiatrist that the patient is capable of making the decision and is not under duress.",

    "story": [
      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A former leading scientist at the National Institutes of Health sued the Trump administration Tuesday, saying she was illegally fired for warning that abrupt research cuts were endangering patients and public health.",
      "The NIH has cut billions of dollars in research projects since President Donald Trump took office in January, bypassing the usual scientific funding process. The cuts included clinical trials testing treatments for cancer, brain diseases and other health problems that a recent report said impacted over 74,000 people enrolled in the experiments.",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo is a well-known HIV expert who led NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Last spring, Marrazzo was put on administrative leave after she challenged NIH officials about the cuts. Among her objections were that some cuts would endanger clinical trial participants while others curtailing infectious disease and vaccine research would harm public health, according to Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "In September, Marrazzo filed a complaint alleging whistleblower retaliation with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and publicly shared her concerns. Weeks later she was fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland that claims violations of whistleblower protections.",
      "In a statement issued by her lawyers, Marrazzo said the lawsuit \"is about protecting not just my right to expose abuse and fraud by our government but those rights for all federal employees, so we can safeguard essential public health priorities and the integrity of scientific research.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

      "The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug's modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women's rights issue.",

      "Susan Monarez was fired as the CDC\u2019s director and Dr. Debra Houry resigned as the agency\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director over disputes about changes at the agency. The two will work with California's public health department to help build trust in \u201cscience-driven decision-making,\u201d Newsom's office said.",
      "\u201cWe're not just wringing our hands right now \u2014 we're fighting back,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference. \u201cThis is a substantive response to what is not happening in Washington.\u201d",
      "California has increasingly positioned itself as a counterweight to federal health policy, and Newsom has amped up his criticisms of President Donald Trump and challenged the Republican's policies in court. The governor's final term ends in just over a year, and he's gearing up for a possible presidential run in 2028.",
      "California joined Washington and Oregon \u2014 two other states with Democratic governors \u2014 to launch an alliance in September to establish their own public health guidance and vaccine recommendations, as the Trump administration makes sweeping changes to vaccine and health policy.",

      "\u201cCalifornia has serious problems, and we need serious solutions from a serious leader,\u201d Strickland said in a statement.",
      "The White House and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to emails seeking comment on the Monarez and Houry hirings.",
      "Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeated falsehoods about vaccines, and the administration has given health recommendations this year that experts say were not backed by science.",
      "Trump in September urged pregnant women not to take Tylenol, saying it could pose a risk of autism to their babies, remarks medical experts said were irresponsible. The CDC website was changed last month to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. A federal vaccine advisory panel voted earlier this month to reverse decades-old guidance recommending that all U.S. babies get immunized against the liver infection hepatitis B on the day they're born. The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "Houry, who spent more than a decade at the CDC, was among a handful of top officials at the agency who resigned around the time Monarez was fired. Houry said in August she was concerned about the rise of vaccine misinformation during the Trump administration, as well as planned budget cuts, reorganization and firings at the CDC.",

      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",

Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",

      "In 2018, German artist Michael Triegel asked a homeless man in Rome to pose for a drawing, thinking that he would make an ideal model for St. Peter if he ever needed to paint the first pope",
      "VATICAN CITY -- In 2018, German artist Michael Triegel asked a homeless man in Rome to pose for a drawing, thinking that he would make an ideal model for St. Peter if he ever needed to paint the first pope.",
      "Seven years on, the man\u2019s likeness has gone on display in the Vatican, a reunion of sorts that came about by improbable chance.",
      "This is a story both big and small, of art and faith and a human tragedy that caught the attention of Pope Francis: homeless German man Burkhard Scheffler died from the cold in 2022 on the edge of St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The saga began in Germany, where Triegel in 2019 won a commission from the Protestant cathedral in the city of Naumburg to create a new central panel for its altar by Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder. The panel would replace an original that was destroyed in 1541 during the Reformation, the upheavals that convulsed parts of Europe as Protestantism emerged in the 16th century.",
      "Cranach\u2019s two side panels survived. Triegel, a Catholic convert, leapt at the prospect of a \u201ccollaboration with Cranach.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had the idea of completing this altar again, in what I find a beautiful gesture \u2014 not to undo these wounds from the 16th century but to mitigate them, to heal them,\u201d he said in an interview in his studio in Leipzig.",
      "Triegel planned out his painting and drew on that encounter he had in 2018 with the homeless man in Rome.",
      "The man took his place as St. Peter among the saints gathered around Mary and the infant Jesus. Triegel said it was important that his subjects not be idealized archetypes but figures the viewer would feel were people \u201cwho could have something to do with me in the here and now, who are not just historic.\u201d",
      "St. Paul was based on a rabbi Triegel drew in Jerusalem, while Mary was modeled on the artist\u2019s daughter. In the back was Protestant pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, an opponent of the Nazis who was executed in 1945.",
      "Triegel\u2019s St. Peter is bearded, wears a red baseball cap and holds a small key \u2014 a reference to the biblical keys of heaven that are often associated with the saint.",
      "The artist found his saint sitting at the entrance of a Roman church begging. As he was about to give the man money, Triegel recalled, \u201che looked at me and at that moment I had the feeling, if you ever need a Peter for a picture, he would be your Peter \u2014 that flowing beard and those alert eyes.\u201d",
      "Triegel asked the man in Italian whether he could draw and photograph him, and the man just nodded \u2014 \u201cso I had no idea what nation he was from.\u201d",
      "Unbeknownst to Triegel, his St. Peter had a rough time after their 2018 encounter.",
      "The man, Burkhard Scheffler, had suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Italy's harsh lockdowns, fewer and fewer people ventured out to provide handouts and food to those in need.",
      "Scheffler was arrested in May 2020 after he apparently threatened someone with a knife for refusing to give him change. He was sentenced to three years in prison and released in late 2022.",
      "Known to many in the Vatican, Scheffler had grown weak in prison. \u201cHis hands, which were always warm, had grown cold,\u201d a Vatican journalist, Gudrun Sailer, would later recall.",
      "On the night of Nov. 25, 2022, Scheffler died from the cold.",
      "His death caught the attention of Francis, who had made a priority of caring for the homeless people around the Vatican. Under Francis' watch, the Vatican installed showers, a barber shop and clinic in the colonnade of St. Peter\u2019s. Francis' almsgiver went out on cold nights to distribute sleeping bags.",

      "Hours after Scheffler died, the Vatican spokesperson issued a statement saying he had been cared for by the Vatican\u2019s charity office but \u201cunfortunately, the rain and cold last night contributed to aggravate his fragile condition.\u201d The spokesperson said Francis remembered in his prayer that day \u201cBurkhard and all those who are forced to live without a home, in Rome and the world.\u201d",
      "Shortly after, Francis said in his weekly Sunday prayer: \u201cI remember Burkhard Scheffler, who died three days ago under the colonnade of St. Peter\u2019s Square: died of cold.\u201d",
      "And the pope returned to the theme in his Palm Sunday homily in April 2023. \u201cI think of the German so-called street person, who died under the colonnade, alone and abandoned. He is Jesus for each of us. So many need our closeness, so many are abandoned.\u201d",
      "Francis asked that Scheffler be buried at the Teutonic cemetery on the grounds of the Vatican, alongside many German-speaking priests, pilgrims and notables. His simple tomb is in the small pilgrim section, in the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica and just a few yards from the tomb of the real St. Peter.",
      "Back in Germany, Triegel spent three years working on the altar for the Naumburg Cathedral, but a problem arose.",
      "There were concerns that the Triegel-Cranach altar could cost the building its place on the UNESCO World Heritage List. UNESCO experts felt that it hindered the overall view of the west chapel, including famous statues. In July, regional authorities said the verdict was that the altar could stay \u2014 but would have to be shown elsewhere in the cathedral.",
      "While that discussion played out, the idea arose of lending the altar to the Catholic chapel of the Teutonic pontifical college at the Vatican, a residence for German-speaking priests adjacent to the cemetery. The chapel has an altar of its own from the period of Cranach\u2019s original.",
      "And it was then in the Teutonic chapel that a Vatican-affiliated art expert recognized Triegel's St. Peter as none other than Scheffler.",
      "\u201cSomeone said, 'This guy with the red cap, we know him because he was living here at St. Peter\u2019s Square,\u201d said Monsignor Peter Klasvogt, rector of the Campo Santo Teutonico, as the complex is known. \u201cThat was a moment you never forget.\u201d",
      "The altar is now on a two-year loan to the chapel, a stone's throw from Scheffler's grave, itself just steps from the tomb of St. Peter.",
      "When Triegel learned that his altar might end up next to Scheffler's grave, he recalled thinking, \u201cthere can't be so many coincidences.\u201d",
      "With the arrival of the painting, \u201cthe story gets another outcome and another exit, and this is so wonderful to see,\u201d Klasvogt said. \u201cWe honor him with the altar, we honor him with his grave and we pray here in the church for him.\u201d",
      "After the argument about the altar\u2019s placement in Germany, the coincidence also appeals to the artist.",
      "\u201cIf this whole dispute was necessary for this picture to go to Rome and for this man to be seen again, for him to get a name, for ... people to take notice of him and remember him, then this whole Naumburg project was really worth it for me,\u201d Triegel said.",

      "The raid is bound to increase tensions between the U.S. and South Africa.

      "The South African Home Affairs Ministry didn't immediately say who the Kenyans worked for, but the U.S. government contracted a Kenya-based company, RSC Africa, to process the refugee applications by white South Africans, according to the U.S. Embassy in South Africa. RSC is operated by Church World Service, a U.S.-based nongovernment organization offering humanitarian aid and refugee assistance across the world.",
      "The statement by South Africa's Home Affairs Ministry said Kenyan nationals had previously been denied visas to travel to South Africa to work on the U.S. refugee program and questioned why the workers who entered the country on tourist visas were working at the refugee application site alongside U.S. officials.",

      "The bulk of the assets \u2014 some 193 billion euros ($227 billion) as of September \u2014 are held in the Brussels-based financial clearing house Euroclear. Russia\u2019s Central Bank sued Euroclear last week.",
      "\u201cGive me a parachute and we\u2019ll all jump together,\u201d De Wever told members of the Belgian parliament just before the summit began. \u201cIf we have confidence in the parachute that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d",
      "Belgium fears that Russia will strike back and would prefer that the bloc borrow the money on international markets. It wants frozen assets held in other European countries to be thrown into the pot as well, and for its partners to guarantee that Euroclear will have the funds it needs should it come under legal attack.",
      "European officials say Russia is waging a campaign of sabotage and disruption across the continent. The Central Bank lawsuit ramped up pressure on Belgium and its European partners ahead of the summit.",
      "The \u201creparations loan\u201d plan would see the EU give 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine. Countries like the U.K., Canada and Norway would make up any shortfall.",
      "Russia's claim to the assets would still stand, but the assets would remain locked away at least until the Kremlin ends its war on Ukraine and pays for the massive damage it's caused over four years of war.",
      "In mapping out the loan plan, the European Commission set up safeguards to protect Belgium, but De Wever remains unconvinced.",
      "\u201cI have not yet seen a text that could satisfactorily address Belgium\u2019s concerns,\" he said. \"I hope to see one today.\u201d",
      "De Wever insisted that Belgium remains \u201ca faithful ally\u201d of Ukraine and wants to continue to help.",
      "Whatever method they use, the leaders have pledged to meet most of Ukraine's needs for the next two years. The International Monetary Fund estimates that would amount to 137 billion euros ($160 billion). The war-ravaged country is at risk of bankruptcy and needs the money by spring.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Silence used to prevail in the forest of a private Caribbean islet until environmentalists transformed it into a love nest for the critically endangered Lesser Antillean iguana.",
      "Now, the sounds of iguanas plopping on the ground and scurrying about as they multiply are making scientists smile.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s ours,\u201d said Devon Carter, a research officer with the nonprofit Anguilla National Trust. \u201cWe don\u2019t have lions, we don\u2019t have elephants, but what we do have, we need to appreciate.\u201d",
      "The population of the Lesser Antillean iguana, also known as Iguana delicatissima, was zero on Prickly Pear East Cay nearly a decade ago.",
      "But scientists in nearby Anguilla who were determined to save the species from extinction tucked 10 iguanas into small, breathable cotton bags and ferried them by boat to the cay with no predators in hopes they would breed.",
      "And breed they did. The population has surged to 300 and counting, converting the cay into one of five sites worldwide where the iguana is trying to make a comeback. It is estimated that there are fewer than 20,000 species remaining, according to conservation groups.",
      "\u201cPrickly Pear East has become a beacon of hope for these gorgeous lizards and proves that when we give native wildlife the chance, they know what to do,\u201d said Jenny Daltry, Caribbean alliance director for the conservation groups Fauna & Flora and Re:wild.",
      "Indigenous people are estimated to have arrived in the eastern Caribbean roughly 7,000 years ago.",
      "The Lesser Antillean iguanas were already there, likely having reached the islands by floating atop debris spewed by rivers that had burst their banks in South America, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "At the time, the iguanas inhabited some 10 islands, but they are now extinct on Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Martin, and have largely vanished from Guadeloupe, St. Barts and Martinique, according to the Re:wild conservation group.",
      "Its biggest threat? The green, or stripe-tailed, iguana. Originally from Central and South America, it was introduced to Guadeloupe in the 1800s and then spread to other islands thanks to Hurricane Luis, which pummeled the northeast Caribbean in 1995.",
      "The green iguanas have more offspring, they are more territorial and they eat more food than the Lesser Antillean iguanas.",
      "But the biggest issue is that both species mate with each other.",
      "\u201cIt really jeopardizes the genetic viability,\u201d said Isabel Curtis, a conservation officer with Anguilla National Trust. \u201cIf your genetics are diluted, your species as a whole can\u2019t continue.\u201d",
      "So in 2015, scientists in Anguilla armed themselves with long poles with a noose at the end to lasso Lesser Antillean iguanas and transport them to Prickly Pear East, where there are no dogs, cats, traffic, green iguanas or other deadly threats.",

      "After one year, scientists captured 23 Lesser Antillean iguanas in Anguilla, a number believed to be almost the island\u2019s entire population of that species.",
      "The iguanas were genetically tested to ensure they were full breeds and then the first 10 were tagged and released on nearby Prickly Pear East, Mukhida said.",
      "Once that population seemed to adapt well to its new home, scientists released the remaining 13 iguanas.",
      "\u201cWe were seeing babies, we were seeing their burrows where they were nesting,\u201d Mukhida recalled. \u201cIt was really encouraging that they were breeding.\u201d",
      "Lesser Antillean iguanas are bright green when young but morph into a slate gray or dusty black as adults, with a lifespan of more than 20 years in the wild.",
      "But concerns remained despite the successful breeding.",
      "Scientists reached out to officials in the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica to obtain more female iguanas in a bid to boost the genetic diversity of the lizards procreating in Prickly Pear East. Dominica has the region's largest population of Lesser Antillean iguanas, but they too are now threatened by green iguanas that arrived after Hurricane Maria hit the region in 2017.",
      "The petition was sent during the pandemic, so Carter and other scientists had to quarantine first before traveling to Dominica. Once there, they built homes for the captured iguanas, monitored their health and ran DNA tests to make sure they weren\u2019t hybrid iguanas.",
      "They fed the iguanas flowers, pumpkins and carrots, although some had to be hand-fed with a syringe, Carter recalled with a laugh.",
      "\u201cThose are the ones you remember the most,\u201d he said, adding that he nicknamed one of them \u201cGreen.\u201d",
      "The captured iguanas were then flown out of Dominica in a special type of pillowcase and boxes with lots of breathing holes and landed in Anguilla, where they were then whisked by boat to Prickly Pear East.",
      "Curtis said saving the Lesser Antillean iguanas is important to maintain biodiversity: \u201cEach species has a specific function.\u201d",
      "They are now breeding across Prickly Pear East. It remains uninhabited but welcomes boaters to the cay\u2019s only two restaurants, which sell barbecued chicken, ribs and lobster. Iguanas are not on the menu.",

Judicial authorities had ruled the building was unsafe.",
      "While the eviction was completed without violence, there were moments of tension when people who were losing their homes had to walk past armored officers.",

      "Africa has been the hardest hit by the Trump administration's expanded travel ban that includes 20 more countries",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Africa has been the hardest hit by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add 20 countries to a list of travel restrictions but reactions on the continent of some 1.5 billion people were largely muted on Wednesday as affected nations mulled the implications of the measure and their next moves.",
      "The new restrictions expand on the list from June and are broader and more punitive than those during Trump\u2019s first presidency, which largely targeted Muslim-majority countries and which were reversed in 2021.",
      "The African Union urged the United States to protect its borders in \u201ca manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing ties and partnership\" between the U.S. and Africa, the bloc's spokesman Nuur Mohamu said.",
      "The stance was a repeat of the statement by the bloc in June, when U.S. President Donald Trump revived the travel restrictions from his first term in office.",
      "Of the five countries whose citizens joined the list on Tuesday of those banned from entering the United States, four are in Africa \u2014 Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and South Sudan, which was already facing significant travel restrictions. Also on the list are Syria and people with travel documents issued by the Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank.",
      "Some other countries \u2014 including Sierra Leone in Africa and Laos in Asia \u2014 were subject to partial restrictions during Trump's first presidency and also in June, and were now moved to the full restrictions list.",
      "Twelve of the 15 countries that face partial restrictions are also in Africa. They include Angola, Benin, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The rest are two Caribbean nations \u2014 Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica \u2014 and Tonga in the South Pacific.",
      "Trump\u2019s expanded measures also link entry limits to security, documentation and visa-overstay concerns.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court on Thursday formally removed the country\u2019s impeached police chief for deploying hundreds of officers to support ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December 2024.",
      "The court said Cho Ji-ho \u201cactively disrupted\u201d legislative activities by sending police forces to the National Assembly and trying to block lawmakers from reaching the main chamber to vote to lift Yoon\u2019s decree.",
      "Cho also infringed upon the independence of the National Election Commission, the court said, by dispatching police to help the military\u2019s seizure of two NEC offices. Yoon said the actions were intended to investigate unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.",
      "Cho, who was impeached by lawmakers and arrested a week after Yoon\u2019s power grab, is the first commissioner general of the National Police Agency to be removed by the Constitutional Court. He was granted bail in January after a Seoul criminal court cited his need for cancer treatment and faces a separate criminal trial on charges of assisting a rebellion.",
      "Yoon imposed martial law on Dec. 3, 2024, describing the action as necessary to suppress an \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition controlling the legislature. Hours later a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through the military and police blockade and unanimously voted to revoke the order.",
      "Lawmakers later in December voted to impeach Yoon, suspending his powers and placing his fate with the Constitutional Court, which formally removed him from office in April. He was rearrested in July and faces a slew of serious charges including rebellion, which is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty.",
      "In its ruling on Cho\u2019s impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court said he cannot remain as the national police chief when he carried out Yoon\u2019s orders despite being clearly aware they were \u201cunconstitutional, unlawful.\u201d",

      "Cho argued his actions did not constitute support for Yoon\u2019s martial law, claiming he sent police to the Assembly to maintain order and prevent accidental clashes.",
      "\u201cConsidering that lawmakers and others had no choice but to enter the National Assembly by abnormal means, such as climbing over fences, due to the respondent\u2019s order to block the entrances, the respondent\u2019s claim is not acceptable,\u201d the court said in a statement.",

      "The Associated Press has documented 145 incidents in what Western officials say is a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022",
      "In November, a train carrying almost 500 people came to a sudden halt in eastern Poland. A broken overhead line had smashed several windows, and the track ahead was damaged. Elsewhere on the line, explosives detonated under a passing freight train.",
      "No one was hurt in either case and the damage was limited, but Poland, which blamed the attack on Russia\u2019s intelligence services, responded forcefully: It deployed 10,000 troops to protect critical infrastructure.",
      "The sabotage in Poland is one of 145 incidents in an Associated Press database that Western officials say are part of a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia. Officials say the campaign \u2014 waged since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 \u2014 aims to deprive Kyiv of support, create divisions among Europeans and identify the continent's security weak spots.",
      "So far in this hybrid war, most known acts of sabotage have resulted in minimal damage \u2014 nothing compared to the tens of thousands of lives lost and cities decimated across Ukraine.",
      "But officials say each act \u2014 from vandalism of monuments to cyberattacks to warehouse fires \u2014 sucks up valuable security resources. The head of one large European intelligence service said investigations into Russian interference now swallow up as much of the agency\u2019s time as terrorism.",
      "While the campaign places a heavy burden on European security services, it costs Russia next to nothing, officials say. That\u2019s because Moscow is carrying out cross-border operations that require European countries to cooperate extensively on investigations \u2014 while often using foreigners with criminal backgrounds as cheap proxies for Russian intelligence operatives. That means Moscow notches up a win just by tying up resources \u2014 even when plots aren\u2019t successful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a 24/7 operation between all the services to stop it,\u201d said a senior European intelligence official, who like the head of the European intelligence service and other officials who spoke to AP insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.",
      "Over the course of the year, AP spoke to more than 40 European and NATO officials from 13 countries to document the scope of this hybrid war, including incidents on its map only when linked by Western officials to Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus.",
      "Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AP that Russia doesn't have \u201cany connection\u201d with the campaign.",
      "AP\u2019s database shows a spike in arson and explosives plots from one in 2023 to 26 in 2024. Six have been documented so far in 2025. Three vandalism cases were recorded last year, meanwhile, and one this year.",
      "The data is incomplete since not all incidents are made public, and it can take officials months to establish a link to Moscow. But the spike matches what officials have warned: The campaign is growing more dangerous.",
      "The countries most frequently targeted, according to the map, border Russia: Poland and Estonia. Several incidents have also occurred in Latvia, the U.K., Germany and France. All are major supporters of Ukraine.",
      "The European official, a senior Baltic intelligence official and another intelligence official said the campaign noticeably calmed in late 2024 and early this year. Their analysis showed Moscow likely paused the campaign to curry favor with U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration. It has since resumed at full pace.",
      "\u201cThey are back to business,\u201d the European official said.",
      "The man officials say was behind the attack on the Polish railway that carries supplies to Ukraine is Yevgeny Ivanov \u2014 a Ukrainian convicted of working with Russian military intelligence to plot arson attacks at home improvement stores, a cafe and a drone factory in Ukraine, according to court documents.",
      "Ivanov, who left Poland after the attack there, worked for Yury Sizov, an officer from Russia's GRU military intelligence service, according to Ukraine\u2019s security service.",
      "Ivanov was convicted in absentia in Ukraine but managed to enter Poland because Ukraine did not inform Polish officials of his conviction, Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski said. Ukraine\u2019s security service said it closely cooperates with allies.",
      "Staging plots that involve perpetrators from several countries or who have crossed borders drains investigatory resources from multiple authorities across Europe \u2014 one of Moscow\u2019s key goals, according to Estonian State Prosecutor Triinu Olev-Aas.",
      "Over the last year, she said the profile of attackers in Estonia has changed from locals largely known to law enforcement to unknown foreigners. That requires increased cooperation among countries to disrupt plots or detain perpetrators.",
      "For two attacks in January \u2014 fires set at a supermarket and a Ukrainian restaurant \u2014 the people hired had never been to Estonia before, Olev-Aas said.",

      "Hundreds of mourners have gathered in Sydney for the funeral of a 10-year-old girl killed in an antisemitic massacre during a Hanukkah celebration",
      "SYDNEY -- Hundreds of mourners bearing bright bouquets and clutching each other in grief gathered at a funeral in Sydney on Thursday for a 10-year-old girl who was gunned down in an antisemitic massacre during a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach.",
      "Matilda, whose last name is being withheld at the request of her family, was enjoying a petting zoo at the festivities on Sunday just before she was killed along with 14 other people in a mass shooting targeting Jews. The suspects, a father and son, were inspired by the Islamic State group, Australian authorities have said.",
      "Beaming photos of Matilda have become a focal point for Australia\u2019s grief at one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever committed in the country. The massacre has prompted a national reckoning about antisemitism and questions about whether the country\u2019s leaders took seriously enough the threat to Australian Jews.",
      "Matilda\u2019s parents, who arrived in Australia from Ukraine, \u201cmoved away from war-torn Eastern Europe to come here for a good life,\u201d Rabbi Dovid Slavin told The Associated Press as he entered the service.",
      "\u201cThey did something that a parent is OK to do, take their child to a family event at Bondi beach,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it ended this way, it\u2019s something for collective responsibility for every adult in this country.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters in Australia\u2019s capital Canberra at the same Matilda\u2019s service began, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unveiled a tranche of legislative plans he said would curb radicalization and hate.",
      "Among his proposals were measures to broaden the definition of hate speech offenses for preachers and leaders who promote violence, to bolster punishments for such crimes, to designate some groups as hateful, and to allow judges to consider hate as an aggravating factor in cases of online threats and harassment.",
      "Officials would have greater powers to reject or cancel visas \u201cfor those who spread hate and division in this country, or would do so if they were allowed to come here,\u201d Albanese added. He didn\u2019t suggest a timeline for the reforms, citing their legal complexity.",
      "\u201cThere have been organizations which any Australian would look at and say their behavior, their philosophy and what they are trying to do is about division and has no place in Australia,\u201d Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told reporters.",
      "\u201cAnd yet for a generation, no government has been able to successfully take action against them because they have fallen just below the legal threshold.\u201d",
      "The announcement followed Albanese's pledge to tighten Australia\u2019s gun controls, which are already some of the toughest in the world. State leaders, too, have promised additional initiatives on firearms and stricter rules for protest gatherings.",
      "Still, the fact that Albanese has not attended any of the victims\u2019 funerals so far \u2014 with local media reporting he has not been invited, despite the presence of other political leaders \u2014 hints at the fury among some Australian Jews feel toward the leader.",
      "Albanese said measures his government has already enacted, including a ban in February on Nazi salutes, show that he has taken the threat of antisemitism seriously.",
      "\u201cI of course acknowledge that more could have been done and I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\u201d Albanese said Thursday. \u201cBut what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, investigators continued to probe the suspected gunmen\u2019s links in Australia and their travel to the Philippines before the attack, said Krissy Barrett, the country\u2019s police chief. Authorities earlier divulged that the younger shooting suspect, Naveed Akram, 24, was investigated for six months by Australia\u2019s security services in 2019.",
      "The older shooter, Sajid Akram, 50, who was shot dead on Sunday, had amassed the guns used in the massacre legally. His gun license was granted in 2023, after his son came to the attention of authorities.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half the workers because they are worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision they plan to announce Wednesday will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Donald Trump. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs for all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\u201cThis proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\u201d Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between \u2019Hell or the highway.' \u201d",
      "The unions say they are worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides over the past two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they are optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Shareholders of both railroads overwhelmingly support it.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",

      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",
      "\u201cNo customer is asking for this. This is strictly a Wall Street play for shareholders,\u201d Andersen said.",
      "Earlier this fall, Buffett and CPKC's CEO both said they weren't interested in any kind of rail merger right now. Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

      "Japan has reported its exports climbed 6% in November from a year earlier as shipments to the United States rose for the first time since March",
      "BANGKOK -- Japan's exports climbed 6% in November from a year earlier, with shipments to the United States rising for the first time since March as uncertainties over tariffs abated following a trade deal with the Trump administration.",
      "The preliminary data released Wednesday showed Japan's total imports rose 1.3% last month over a year earlier, leaving a surplus of 322.2 billion yen (about $2.1 billion).",
      "Exports to the U.S. rose nearly 9% from the year before as shipments of cars, chemicals and cameras helped make up for declines in machinery and iron and steel. Imports of U.S. oil nearly tripled, along with sharp increases in imports of grain and other food products.",
      "Japan\u2019s deal on tariffs with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, setting the baseline import duty for most products at 15% instead of the earlier plan for a 25% tariff, helped boost passenger car shipments by 8% when measured by the number of vehicles. But the value of those cars, trucks and buses inched up only 1.5%, reflecting the reluctance of automakers to pass costs from higher tariffs onto consumers.",
      "Imports from the U.S. climbed more than 7%, though Japan still logged a trade surplus of 739.8 billion yen ($4.7 billion), up 11% from a year earlier.",
      "Japan's exports to the European Union surged about 20% last month from a year earlier, supported by growth in demand for machinery, vehicles and other manufactured goods.",

      "Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos have donated $5 million to David Flink, founder of the Neurodiversity Alliance",
      "NEW YORK -- Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms.",
      "\u201cI feel like there\u2019s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don\u2019t matter,\u201d Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. \"That\u2019s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.\u201d",
      "Flink is among this year's five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals.",
      "The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical.",
      "The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder's net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world.",
      "Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model.",
      "S\u00e1nchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last year that her children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Fly Who Flew to Space,\" is for \"the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn't smart.\" She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested.",
      "The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award's previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice.",
      "The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos\u2019 ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today\u2019s entrepreneur-philanthropists \u2014 Bill Gates, for example \u2014 tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education.",
      "\u201cRather than trying to change the system, what they\u2019re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,\u201d Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. \u201cIt really is a much older model of philanthropy.\u201d",
      "The award's size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million.",

      "A federal judge has blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from revoking an easement that allows Enbridge to run an oil pipeline through a Great Lakes channel",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.",
      "Whitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.",
      "Enbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings  this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.",
      "\u201cAn oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,\u201d Jonker wrote. \u201cBut for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit.",
      "Enbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from \u201csignificant energy disruptions.\u201d",

And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.",
      "In Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.",
      "The Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.",

      "Some oil vessels are diverting away from Venezuela after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving the South American country",
      "MIAMI -- Some oil vessels are diverting away from Venezuela after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving the South American country, a dramatic escalation in the White House\u2019s pressure campaign on leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Trump said Tuesday on social media, in all caps, that he is ordering a \"total and complete blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers\u201d into and out of Venezuela, a move that threatens to choke off revenue from the world's largest oil reserves that are key to Maduro's grip on power.",
      "It\u2019s not clear exactly what Trump meant by his threats. U.S. sanctions adopted during his first administration make it illegal for Americans to purchase Venezuela\u2019s crude oil without a license from the Treasury Department.",
      "Additionally, hundreds of ships themselves have been sanctioned \u2014 part of a massive shadow fleet of often aging vessels that has proliferated in recent years to transport oil on behalf of Iran, Russia, Venezuela and other U.S. adversaries under sanctions.",
      "At least 30 vessels under sanctions are navigating near Venezuela, according to Windward, a maritime intelligence firm that helps U.S. officials target the shadow fleet. A few have started to change their course, perhaps fearing they could face the same fate as the Skipper, a sanctioned vessel seized by U.S. forces last week near Venezuela.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that this has disrupted energy flows to and from Venezuela,\u201d said Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a senior analyst at Windward. \"Every hour when we\u2019re tracking these vessels, we are seeing tankers that are deviating, loitering or changing their behavior.\u201d",
      "Among those is the Hyperion, which had been sailing toward the Jose port in Venezuela before doing a 90-degree turn early Wednesday and starting to head north away from the South American mainland.",
      "The vessel, previously part of Russia\u2019s state-owned shipping fleet, was one of 173 sanctioned in the final days of the Biden administration for allegedly facilitating Russian oil sales in violation of sanctions over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Following the penalties, the vessel changed its flag from the Comoros to Gambia. But the West African nation deleted Hyperion \u2014 along with dozens of other vessels \u2014 from its privately run ship registry in November for allegedly using false certificates claiming to have been issued by its maritime authority.",
      "The vessel\u2019s ownership also is obfuscated under multiple layers of offshore companies, some of them listed in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just screaming that it\u2019s in a position to be seized,\u201d Wiese Bockmann said.",
      "Since the first Trump administration imposed punishing oil sanctions on Venezuela in 2017, Maduro\u2019s government has boosted its reliance on a network of rogue tankers to smuggle a growing share of the roughly 900,000 barrels of oil per day that the OPEC nation produces.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr will face Senate questioning Wednesday for the first time since he pressured broadcasters to take ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air, a stance that drew bipartisan criticism and raised concerns about government interference in the media.",
      "Carr will appear before the Senate Commerce committee for an oversight hearing that will also include the FCC\u2019s two other commissioners, Olivia Trusty and Anna M. Gomez. It will be the first Senate Commerce oversight hearing with all FCC commissioners since 2020, though there are two vacancies on the five-member panel.",
      "Since being tapped by President Donald Trump last November to lead the nation\u2019s top broadcast regulator, Carr has closely aligned with the administration\u2019s aggressive posture toward media outlets it views as hostile.

He called Kimmel's remarks \u201ctruly sick\u201d and warned broadcasters, \u201cWe can do this the easy way or the hard way.\u201d Hours later, ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended indefinitely.",

Nexstar was one of two ABC affiliate owners that said they would preempt Kimmel\u2019s show with local programming following his comments about Kirk.",

      "It\u2019s a sea change from how foreign automakers operated in China for decades by making cars they developed overseas, sharing their technology with local partners. That strategy has been shoved aside by fast-rising local competitors who have sharply cut into the sales of foreign brands.",
      "\u201cThis business model is now gone,\u201d Thomas Ulbrich, the chief technology officer of the Volkswagen Group in China said.",
      "In what Ulbrich calls a paradigm shift, Volkswagen started its latest overhaul of its approach to China in 2022.",
      "It is developing vehicles specifically tailored to Chinese drivers \u2014 cars that will likely never be seen on European roads , though they may make their way to markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.",
      "As the new models roll out, Volkswagen will find out if the investment will pay off by helping it to catch up with the likes of Chinese makers BYD and Geely and win back market share.",
      "Such a strategy is key to regaining competitiveness within China, said Rella Suskin, an equity analyst at Morningstar covering the European automotive sector.",
      "But, she predicted, \u201cit will enable them to maintain market share levels in line with current levels, rather than allow them to regain the market share that has been lost over the last few years.\"",
      "The question is whether it can make money in a hypercompetitive market that has driven prices down to bankrupting levels.",
      "Audi, part of the Volkswagen Group, led the way with this year's introduction of a new brand dubbed \u201cAUDI\u201d \u2014 its name in capital letters. VW is gearing up to launch new 2026 models developed \u201cin China, for China,\u201d as the carmaker likes to say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a million-dollar question whether this strategy will pay off,\u201d said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cWe have to monitor, but I think they are on the right track of catching up in the race.\u201d",
      "Foreign automakers fell behind because of dramatic changes in the Chinese market over the past five years.",
      "Electric vehicles have shot up to about half of new car sales. And buyers expect them to come with the latest digital features, from big iPad-like touch screens to autonomous driving capabilities such as effortless backing into a parking space.",

      "Volkswagens were no longer the right fit in a major market that accounts for about one-third of its global sales, 40 years after it began making sedans in Shanghai with its state-owned local partner, SAIC. For years, basic VW Santana and Jetta sedans were a mainstay of taxi fleets, and the first cars purchased by many city dwellers.",
      "Now, it needs to revamp it's line-up at what has become known as \u201cChina speed.\u201d In a market as competitive as China\u2019s, survival depends on pushing out new models and features quickly, said Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy.",
      "Chinese EV makers bring new cars to market in 12 to 18 months, versus three to five years for global automakers. \u201cThe pace is not a choice but a necessity \u2014 and that pressure fuels global competitiveness,\u201d Russo said.",
      "In the mid-1990s, Ulbrich worked in northeastern China, where VW made sedans with another state company, FAW, or First Auto Works, importing everything from seats to wheel rims. The parts weren't available locally.",
      "Thirty years later, nearly everything is made in China. And now it's being designed here. To speed up product development, Volkswagen headquarters has given decision-making power to the local operation.",
      "Other foreign automakers have reacted in different ways. Some have reduced their operations or even pulled out. Japan\u2019s Toyota, like Volkswagen, has transferred authority to its China team to accelerate decision-making, giving them \"unprecedented autonomy in product planning and development,\u201d Yuan said.",
      "Volkswagen is looking to pick up know-how from China's EV startups. It has teamed up with electric vehicle maker Xpeng to bring new models to market more quickly and develop its own electronic architecture \u2014 essentially the internal computer system that runs all a car's functions.",
      "The approach reflects a growing recognition among foreign automakers that they can learn from China, and not just vice versa. For many, the key is how quickly Chinese firms can turn an idea into a product, slashing development costs and delivering what customers want in a timely way.",
      "\u201cKnowledge flows are a two-way street between China and Germany,\u201d said Martin Hofmann\u200b, a Volkswagen executive who is the chair of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China.",
      "In a recent survey of the chamber\u2019s membership, about half of the more than 600 responding companies said they expect Chinese competitors to become innovation leaders in the next five years \u2014 and 9% said they already are.",

      "Many U.S. consumers say they\u2019ve noticed higher than usual prices for holiday gifts in recent months, according to a a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research",
      "NEW YORK -- The Ah Louis Store in San Luis Obispo, California, turns into a winter wonderland every holiday season.",
      "Green garlands, giant nutcrackers, baubles and bows go up in early November on the historic downtown building that houses the gift shop. Inside, customers can choose from over 500 different types of ornaments and a variety of holiday gift baskets.",
      "\u201cWe really just make it a magical spot,\u201d co-owner Emily Butler said. \u201cWhether you come in or not, we want to make sure that we\u2019re spreading that holiday joy.\u201d",
      "But Butler says she and her twin sister-business partner had to work harder this year to turn browsers into buyers and to make a profit. Many of the decorations and stocking stuffers they sell are made overseas and either did not arrive or got more expensive when President Donald Trump imposed unusually high taxes on imported goods, she said.",
      "In response, the sisters focused their selection on more profitable items like nutcrackers and gift baskets. They've also noticed customers cutting back, selecting a $100 gift basket over the $150 version, or buying one ornament instead of several, Butler said..",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more cautious spending this year,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with the unpredictable tariffs, stubborn inflation and weak hiring have shaken consumer confidence in the U.S. economy. The vast majority of U.S. adults say they\u2019ve noticed higher than usual prices for groceries, electricity and holiday gifts in recent months, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "A Gallup index that summarizes Americans\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions fell to a 17-month low in November. Consumers also indicated less enthusiasm for spending money on holiday gifts; their estimated gift budgets decreased $229 between October and November, the largest drop Gallup has recorded at that point of the holiday shopping season. The survey was conducted in November, partially during the government shutdown, which might have tempered spending plans.",
      "However, the worst-case impact on consumer prices that many economists foresaw from the Trump administration's tariff policies hasn't materialized. Some products have been affected more than others. Here's a look at what has happened with supplies and prices in popular gifting categories.",
      "Game and toys were particularly susceptible to tariff-related price increases since the majority of the ones sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to industry trade group The Toy Association. The tariff rate the Trump administration imposed on Chinese goods became a rollercoaster that started at an additional 10%, peaked at 145% and ended up at 47%.",
      "The uncertainty made it hard for toy shops to decide what to order for the holidays. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said the manufacturers in China that he buys toys from did not pass on their tariff costs all at once but he has seen their prices inch higher with every reorder.",
      "Smith estimated that wholesale prices for 80% of his inventory went up anywhere from 5% to 20%. Some shoppers who don't buy toys regularly might be surprised by price increases he adopted in turn, Smith said. A doll that sold for $20 to $25 last year now costs $30 to $35 at JaZams, he said.",
      "\u201cFor folks with marginal incomes, this is going to be a very difficult holiday,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Consumer electronics are mostly made in China and other Asian countries. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports, and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, according to the Consumer Technology Association trade group.",

But CEO Corie Barry said late last month that the consumer electronics chain made sure to stock computers, phones and other products at different price levels, a decision she credited with helping Best Buy attract more lower-income shoppers.",
      "\u201cThe consumer is not a monolith,\u201d Barry told reporters.",
      "Game consoles are always a popular holiday item, and console makers made news earlier this year when they announced price increases. Sony raised the price of the PlayStation 5 by $50 to $550 in August, following Microsoft and Nintendo raising prices for their game consoles.",
      "Jewelry shoppers will likely see higher prices, but that has more to do with the soaring price of gold than tariffs so far, according to David Bonaparte, president & CEO of trade group Jewelers of America.",
      "The varying tax rates Trump set for countries that import American goods with a total value less than their exports to the U.S. affected jewelry in various ways. Watches from Switzerland, for example, were subject to a 39% tariff from July 31 until the country struck a deal with the Trump administration last month to lower the import tax rate on its products to 15%.",
      "India, which refines many of the diamonds sold in the U.S., rushed in shipments of the gemstones before a 50% tariff on the country's products took effect on Aug. 27. Higher prices for jewelry made with diamonds shipped from India will likely start to be felt in 2026, Bonaparte said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of what happens after Jan. 1,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these tariffs are still in place, then prices will probably increase.\u201d",
      "Holiday decorations are yet another category that mostly comes from overseas, particularly China.",
      "Jeremy Rice co-owns House, a home-d\u00e9cor shop in Lexington, Kentucky, that specializes in artificial flowers, wreaths and table decorations. He said the tariffs slowed down production of much of his fall stock and seasonal merchandise like ribbon. Some larger and more expensive items he didn't order at all because they would have been too expensive to retail.",
      "Rice raised prices on the products he did get. The popular red berry stems that House long has carried increased from $8.95 last year to $10.95 due to higher import costs, he said.",
      "\"We sell thousands of these berry stems, and every time we sold one, I flinched from knowing what it should have been, knowing that our supplier paid more for them, which made us pay more for them, which made our customer pay more for them,\" Rice said.",
      "For those looking to avoid tariff-related price increases, John Harmon, managing director of technology research at technology consulting company Coresight Resarch, recommends checking out secondhand stores and discount retailers like T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods. The off-price chains buy much of their inventory from leftover stock that would have entered the U.S. before new tariffs kicked in.",
      "Joe Adamski, senior director at procurement services company ProcureAbility, said books, food and beverages are some of the domestically produced goods that make good gifts.",

    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s rial has hit a new record low of over 1.3 million to the U.S. dollar, deepening its collapse amid sanctions and regional tensions",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s rial slid further Monday to a new record low of more than 1.3 million to the U.S. dollar, deepening the currency\u2019s collapse less than two weeks after it first breached the 1.2-million mark amid sanctions pressure and regional tensions.",
      "Currency traders in Tehran quoted the dollar above 1.3 million rials, underscoring the speed of the decline since Dec. 3, when the rial hit what was then a historic low.",
      "The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressures, pushing up prices for food and other daily necessities and further straining household budgets, a trend that could be intensified by a gasoline price change introduced in recent days.",
      "Iran on Saturday added a third gasoline price tier, raising the cost of full bought beyond monthly quotes at 50,000 rials (4 U.S. cents). It is the first major adjustment to fuel pricing since a price hike in 2019 that sparked nationwide protests and a crackdown that reportedly killed over 300 people.",
      "Under the revised system, motorists continue to receive 60 liters a month at the subsidized rate of 15,000 rials per liter and another 100 liters at 30,000 rials, but any additional purchases now cost more than three times the original subsidized price. While gasoline in Iran remains among the cheapest in the world, economists warn the change could feed inflation at a time when the rapidly weakening rial is already pushing up the cost of food and other basic goods.",
      "The fall comes as efforts to revive negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran\u2019s nuclear program appear stalled, while uncertainty persists over the risk of renewed conflict following June\u2019s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel. Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.",

At the time the 2015 accord was implemented \u2014 which sharply curtailed Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief \u2014 the rial traded at about 32,000 to the dollar.",
      "After Trump returned to the White House for a second term in January, his administration revived a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, expanding sanctions that target Iran\u2019s financial sector and energy exports. Washington has again pursued firms involved in trading Iranian crude oil, including discounted sales to buyers in China, according to U.S. statements.",
      "Further pressure followed in late September, when the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "Economists warn that the rial\u2019s accelerating decline risks feeding a vicious cycle of higher prices and reduced purchasing power, particularly for staples such as meat and rice that are central to Iranian diets. For many Iranians, the latest record low reinforces concerns that relief remains distant as diplomacy falters and sanctions tighten.",

      "Isaacman, who has promised to bring a business-minded approach to the space agency, was confirmed in a bipartisan vote, 67-30.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Saturn's giant moon Titan may not have a vast underground ocean after all.",
      "Titan instead may hold deep layers of ice and slush more akin to Earth\u2019s polar seas, with pockets of melted water where life could possibly survive and even thrive, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.",
      "They stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system\u2019s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.",
      "But with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, \u201cthere is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,\u201d said the University of Washington\u2019s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "As to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, \u201cnature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.",
      "JPL\u2019s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan\u2019s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.",
      "Computer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).",
      "Because Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn\u2019s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon\u2019s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.",
      "Through improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan\u2019s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan\u2019s orientation in space supported their theory.",
      "Sapienza University of Rome\u2019s Luciano Iess, whose previous studies using Cassini data indicated a hidden ocean at Titan, is not convinced by the latest findings.",

      "Fernando Moreno has been waiting for a kidney transplant for about two years",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Fernando Moreno has been on dialysis for about two years, enduring an \u201cunbearable\u201d wait for a new kidney to save his life. His limited world of social contacts has meant that his hopes have hinged on inching up the national waiting list for a transplant.",
      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them. A second effort, a pilot program with three patients in North Carolina that ended last year, helped match all three with living donors.",

      "Living kidney donations can be a better match, reducing the risk of organ rejection. They allow for surgery to be planned for a time that is optimal for the donor, the recipient and the transplant team. And, the foundation says, living donor kidneys, on average, last longer than kidneys from deceased donors.",
      "The National Kidney Foundation says living donors must be at least 18 years old, although some transplant centers set the minimum age at 21. Potential donors get screened for health problems and can be ruled out if they have uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes or cancer, or if they are smokers.",
      "Many living donors make \u201cdirected donations\u201d to specify who will get their kidney. Nondirected donations are made anonymously to a patient.",

      "A study released last year found that people who volunteer to donate a kidney are at a lower risk of death from the operation than doctors had previously thought.

Newer and safer surgical techniques were credited for dropping the risk from 3 deaths per 10,000 living donors.",

      "It's similar to other apps designed to restrict screen time by forcing users to take a timeout from scrolling. The difference is that Touch Grass requires users to go outside and take a picture of themselves physically touching some grass.",
      "Touch Grass has a free service level that allows you to block two apps. I found it was quite effective at stopping me from opening two of my favorite time-wasters, Reddit and Instagram, though I ended up spending more time on other apps like Facebook. To block all apps, you'll have to shell out for a subscription \u2014 $6 a month or $50 annually.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.",
      "\u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,\" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world\u2019s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.",

      "Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",

      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "Things were very different when his father, also named Alido Luis, started fishing in the 1970s. Back then, they went out in a sailboat, and the coral reefs were so healthy they found plenty of fish close to the coast.",

      "IS, which had seized territory in Iraq and Syria years ago but is now a decentralized alliance of militant groups that share a violent ideology, realized years ago that social media could be a potent tool for recruitment and disinformation, so it's not surprising that the group is testing out AI, national security experts say.",
      "For loose-knit, poorly resourced extremist groups \u2014 or even an individual bad actor with a web connection \u2014 AI can be used to pump out propaganda or deepfakes at scale, widening their reach and expanding their influence.",
      "\u201cFor any adversary, AI really makes it much easier to do things,\u201d said John Laliberte, a former vulnerability researcher at the National Security Agency who is now CEO of cybersecurity firm ClearVector. \u201cWith AI, even a small group that doesn't have a lot of money is still able to make an impact.\u201d",
      "Militant groups began using AI as soon as programs like ChatGPT became widely accessible. In the years since, they have increasingly used generative AI programs to create realistic-looking photos and video.",
      "When strapped to social media algorithms, this fake content can help recruit new believers, confuse or frighten enemies and spread propaganda at a scale unimaginable just a few years ago.",
      "Such groups spread fake images two years ago of the Israel-Hamas war depicting bloodied, abandoned babies in bombed-out buildings. The images spurred outrage and polarization while obscuring the war's actual horrors. Violent groups in the Middle East used the photos to recruit new members, as did antisemitic hate groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.",
      "Something similar happened last year after an attack claimed by an IS affiliate killed nearly 140 people at a concert venue in Russia. In the days after the shooting, AI-crafted propaganda videos circulated widely on discussion boards and social media, seeking new recruits.",

But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",

      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",

This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",

IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",

      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",

That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",

      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",
      "Young, single men are often cited as the driving force behind this trend. But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",
      "Blom\u2019s Holy Theophany launched a second church this year because their 250-capacity building was consistently overflowing, with dozens standing outside each week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost full already,\u201d he said of the new location. \u201cAnd back at our church, again we have a bunch of people standing outside every Sunday. We just can\u2019t keep up.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re already in talks to launch a third church.",
      "While some Orthodox content creators are priests, others have no formal ties to the church. They span ideological and political affiliations, with some leaning far right and others who are conventional religious conservatives on issues like marriage and abortion.",

In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach. And one of the things Orthodoxy hasn\u2019t had in forever is reach.\u201d",
      "Pageau, who converted in 2003, says he and other influencers stress the importance of in-person community to their followers.",
      "\u201cWe tell them to go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live this in your mind online because it is distorting. When you go to church, you meet all kinds of people, people that are on all sides of the political aisle.\u201d",
      "Abia Ailleen researched Orthodoxy online for six months before stepping inside Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles. The 28-year-old Latina, who was chrismated \u2014 or received into the faith \u2014 in April 2024, also sees a disconnect between Orthodoxy online and in the flesh.",

      "Part of what\u2019s fueling the perception that only men are converting is that many influencers overlap with the so-called manosphere \u2014 content online that caters toward men grappling with their understanding of masculinity.

      "Though appealing to some, others believe these influencers distort their idea of Christianity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my cup of tea,\u201d said Aaron Velasco, a 26-year-old filmmaker chrismated last year.",
      "And while Velasco did take an interest in some content creators, and appreciates Pageau\u2019s demeanor and perspective, he thinks many of them preach an inflammatory version of the faith that doesn\u2019t fit his current understanding of it.",
      "Many adherents say the broader church is more ideologically diverse than the rigid conservatism often found online.",

It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s not a masculine image,\u201d said Dina Zingaro, who is studying Orthodoxy at Harvard Divinity School and who was raised in the faith. \u201cAt the same time, there are so many counter-narratives in Orthodoxy that uproot this idea.\u201d",

We need to lift up the real spirit and the core of Orthodoxy, which is really the opposite of this rule-based male domination version.\u201d",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",

      "Frank Athen Walls, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke.

      "The Senate is taking final votes to pass an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is nearing final passage Wednesday of an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs while pressuring Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video of strikes on alleged drug boats in international water near Venezuela.",
      "The annual National Defense Authorization Act, which would raise troop pay by 3.8%, gained bipartisan backing as it moved through the Senate, and the White House has indicated that it is in line with President Donald Trump's national security priorities. However, the legislation, which ran over 3,000 pages, revealed some points of friction between Congress and the Pentagon as the Trump administration reorients its focus away from security in Europe and towards Central and South America.",
      "The bill pushes back on recent moves by the Pentagon. It demands more information on boat strikes in the Caribbean, requires that the U.S. keep its troop levels in Europe at current levels and sends some military aid to Ukraine.",
      "But overall, the bill represents a compromise between the parties. It implements many of Trump's executive orders and proposals on eliminating diversity and inclusion efforts in the military and grants emergency military powers at the U.S. border with Mexico. It also enhances congressional oversight of the Department of Defense and repeals several years-old war authorizations.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it was part of the \u201cinvestment that we need to be making to ensure that in a dangerous world we are prepared to defend America and American interests.\u201d",
      "Still, the sprawling bill faced objections from both Democratic and Republican leadership on the Senate Commerce Committee. That's because the legislation allows military aircraft to obtain a waiver to operate without broadcasting their precise location, as an Army helicopter had done before a midair collision with an airliner in Washington, D.C. in January that killed 67 people.",
      "\"The special carve-out was exactly what caused the January 29th crash that claimed 67 lives,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said at a news conference this week.",
      "Cruz said he was seeking a vote on bipartisan legislation in the next month that would require military aircraft to use a precise location sharing tool and improve coordination between commercial and military aircraft in busy areas.",
      "Republicans and Democrats agreed to language in the defense bill that threatens to withhold a quarter of Hegseth\u2019s travel budget until he provides unedited video of the strikes with the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services, as well as the orders authorizing them.",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill Tuesday ahead of the bill's passage to brief lawmakers on the U.S. military campaign in international water near Venezuela. The briefing elicited contrasting responses from many lawmakers, with Republicans largely backing the campaign and Democrats expressing concern about it and saying they had not received enough information.",
      "The committees are investigating a Sept. 2 strike \u2014 the first of the campaign \u2014 that killed two people who had survived an initial attack on their boat. The Navy admiral who ordered the \u201cdouble-tap\u201d strike, Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, was also appearing before the committees Wednesday in a classified briefing that will also include video of the strike in question.",

The defense legislation requires that Congress be kept in the loop on decisions like that going forward, as well as when top military brass are removed.",
      "The Pentagon is also required, under the legislation, to keep at least 76,000 troops and major equipment stationed in Europe unless NATO allies are consulted and there is a determination that such a withdrawal is in U.S. interests. Around 80,000 to 100,000 U.S. troops are usually present on European soil. A similar requirement also keeps the number of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea at 28,500.",
      "Lawmakers are also pushing back on some Pentagon decisions by authorizing $400 million for each of the next two years to manufacture weapons to be sent to Ukraine.",
      "Trump and Hegseth have made it a priority to purge the military of material and programs that address diversity, anti-racism or gender issues, and the defense bill would codify many of those changes. It will repeal diversity, equity and inclusion offices and trainings, including the position of chief diversity officer. Those cuts would save the Pentagon about $40 million, according to the Republican-controlled House Armed Services Committee.",

      "Prosecutors have tried to show that Dugan intentionally interfered with members of a federal immigration task force's efforts to arrest 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz at the Milwaukee County Courthouse.",
      "Members of the task force testified that they learned Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally after he was arrested in Milwaukee on state battery charges. He was scheduled to appear for a hearing in front of Dugan on April 18. Six agents and officers staked out Dugan's courtroom that morning, ready to arrest him when he emerged from the hearing.",

      "Two agents Dugan missed during her confrontations with the team followed Flores-Ruiz outside and a foot chase through traffic ensued before he was finally arrested. Members of the team testified that Dugan divided them and forced them out of position, leaving them too short-handed to make a safe arrest in the hallway.",
      "Cervera, for her part, testified that she was uncomfortable backing up Dugan during her confrontations with the arrest team. She said she was shocked when she heard Dugan led Flores-Ruiz out a private door, adding that judges shouldn't help defendants evade arrest. Cervera also testified that Dugan told her three days after the incident that Dugan was \u201cin the doghouse\u201d with the chief judge, Carl Ashley, because she \u201ctried to help that guy.\u201d",
      "Dugan's attorneys have countered during cross-examinations that Dugan didn't intend to obstruct the arrest team and was trying to follow a draft courthouse policy from Ashley that called for court employees to refer immigration agents looking to make an arrest in the courthouse to supervisors.",
      "They've also argued that the arrest team could have apprehended Flores-Ruiz at any point after he emerged from the courtroom and Dugan shouldn't be blamed for their decision to wait until he got outside.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died at 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had entered hospice on Saturday while suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN of the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \"They are hitting the center of the city.\"",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966 he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when the soldier paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining The Associated Press as its Indonesia correspondent.",
      "That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies he would find himself in, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at and, if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "He would stay in Vietnam until the capital of Saigon fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975 and in the time leading up to those final days he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "ATLANTA -- After more than a year of legal maneuvering, Fani Willis is facing questions Wednesday from a Georgia state Senate committee over her prosecution of Donald Trump.",
      "The hearing began with Sen. Greg Dolezal, the committee vice chair, questioning Fulton County\u2019s Democratic district attorney about her background and the makeup of her office.",
      "The Republican-dominated state Senate in January 2024 created the Special Committee on Investigation to examine allegations of misconduct against Willis concerning her case seeking criminal convictions for efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss in Georgia. Even before Trump embarked on a retribution campaign against his enemies, Republicans on the Georgia committee were eager to bring Willis in for questioning.",
      "In an email to supporters Wednesday morning, Willis\u2019 reelection campaign accused the committee of \u201ctrying to dig up dirt, slow us down, and distract Fani Willis from her job.\u201d",
      "The email asks people to pack the hearing room in the Capitol or to send her a campaign donation.",
      "\u201cWe want to make today \u2014 the day they tried to tear her down \u2014 our single biggest fundraising day of the year,\u201d it says. \u201cLet\u2019s turn their political stunt into a massive show of grassroots strength.\u201d",
      "In an often testy exchange with Dolezal, Willis denied deciding she was going to prosecute Trump before taking office.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we call a lie,\u201d Willis said.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to commit a crime prior to me taking office. It\u2019s factually impossible,\u201d she said. Willis took office on Jan. 1, 2021.",
      "Asked how much money her office spent prosecuting the election interference case against Trump and others, Willis said she didn't know.",
      "\u201cWhatever it cost, they tried to steal the rights of thousands of Georgians. It couldn\u2019t have been enough,\u201d she said.",
      "When Willis announced the indictment against Trump and 18 others in August 2023, she used the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to allege a conspiracy to try to illegally overturn Trump\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.",

      "Republicans didn't like that, but the committee has focused on Willis\u2019 hiring of special prosecutor Nathan Wade to lead the election interference case. The resolution creating the committee said a romantic relationship between the two amounted to a \u201cclear conflict of interest and a fraud upon the taxpayers.\u201d But now the case is defunct after Willis was removed and another prosecutor dismissed it.",
      "Willis told Dolezal she hired Wade \u201cbecause we were drowning\u201d in other cases. \u201cEvery lawyer I had with that level of experience had a huge project,\u201d Willis said.",
      "\u201cI made a decision, the people of Fulton County elected me to make that decision, and I did,\u201d Willis said.",
      "Democrats have decried the panel as a partisan time-waster driven by political ambition. Four Republicans on the committee are running for statewide office in 2026. Chairman Bill Cowsert of Athens is running for attorney general, while Sens. Dolezal of Cumming, Blake Tillery of Vidalia and Steve Gooch of Dahlonega are each seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. Another Republican who had been on the committee, John Kennedy of Macon, resigned from the Senate last week to pursue his own bid for lieutenant governor.",
      "Thus far, the committee has turned up few new facts regarding Willis\u2019 activities. Trump has called Willis a \u201ccriminal\u201d who should be \u201cprosecuted\u201d and \u201cput in jail.\u201d",
      "Amid a court battle over the committee\u2019s power to order her to appear, Willis didn\u2019t show up last year when subpoenaed. A judge agreed that Willis couldn't ignore the subpoena, and her lawyers worked out an agreement for Willis to appear when the subpoena was reissued this year.",
      "Roy Barnes, the former Democratic Georgia governor representing Willis, counseled Willis against answering some questions and also engaged in some heated exchanges with Dolezal, at one point saying, \u201cThis is a witch hunt. This has always been a witch hunt.\u201d",
      "Willis' prosecution began to fall apart in January 2024, when a defense attorney in the case alleged that Willis was involved in an improper romantic relationship with Wade.",
      "In an extraordinary hearing, both Willis and Wade testified about the intimate details of their relationship. They both vehemently denied allegations that it constituted a conflict of interest.",
      "The trial judge chided Willis for a \u201ctremendous lapse in judgment,\u201d ultimately ruling that Willis could remain on the case if Wade resigned, which he did hours later.",
      "But after defense attorneys appealed, the Georgia Court of Appeals cited an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d and removed Willis from the case. The state Supreme Court in September declined to hear Willis' appeal.",

      "The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion, including medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump\u2019s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China\u2019s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "In separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve \u201cU.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient\u2019s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\u201d the statements said.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\u201d said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.",
      "\u201cThis cannot save the doomed fate of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for \u2018Taiwan Independence\u2019 through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\u201d he added.",
      "Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \u201csufficient self-defense capabilities\u201d and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \u201cis the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\u201d the ministry said.",

      "The arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.",

      "Norman Podhoretz, a leading neo-conservative and the former editor of Commentary magazine, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Norman Podhoretz, the boastful, hard-line editor and author whose books, essays and stewardship of Commentary magazine marked a political and deeply personal break from the left and made him a leader of the neo-conservative movement, has died. He was 95.",
      "Podhoretz died \u201cpeacefully and without pain\u201d Tuesday night, his son John Podhoretz confirmed in a statement on Commentary's website. His cause of death was not immediately released.",
      "\u201cHe was a man of great wit and a man of deep wisdom and he lived an astonishing and uniquely American life,\u201d John Podhoretz said.",
      "Norman Podhoretz was among the last of the so-called \u201cNew York intellectuals\u201d of the mid-20th century, a famously contentious circle that at various times included Norman Mailer, Hannah Arendt, Susan Sontag and Lionel Trilling. As a young man, Podhoretz longed to join them. In middle age, he departed. Like Irving Kristol, Gertrude Himmelfarb and other founding neo-conservatives, Podhoretz began turning from the liberal politics he shared with so many peers and helped reshape the national dialogue in the 1960s and after.",
      "The son of Jewish immigrants, Podhoretz was 30 when he was named editor-in-chief of Commentary in 1960, and years later transformed the once-liberal magazine into an essential forum for conservatives. Two future U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick, received their appointments in part because of essays they published in Commentary that called for a more assertive foreign policy.",
      "Despised by former allies, Podhoretz found new friends all the way to the White House, from President Ronald Reagan, a reader of Commentary; to President George W. Bush, who in 2004 awarded Podhoretz the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, and praised him as a \"man of \u201cfierce intellect\u201d who never \u201ctailored his opinion to please others.\u201d",
      "Podhoretz, who stepped down as editor-in-chief in 1995, had long welcomed argument. The titles of his books were often direct and provocative: \"Making It,\" \"The Present Danger,\" \"World War IV,\" \"Ex-Friends: Falling Out with Allen Ginsberg, Lionel and Diana Trilling, Lillian Hellman, Hannah Arendt, and Norman Mailer.\" He pressed for confrontation everywhere from El Salvador to Iran, and even disparaged Reagan for talking to Soviet leaders, calling such actions \"the Reagan road to detente.\" For decades, he rejected criticism of Israel, once writing that \u201chostility toward Israel\u201d is not only rooted in antisemitism but a betrayal of \u201cthe virtues and values of Western civilization.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Podhoretz became a choice target for disparagement and creative license. New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani called \u201cWorld War IV\u201d an \u201cillogical screed based on cherry-picked facts and blustering assertions.\u201d Ginsberg, once a fellow student at Columbia University, would mock the heavy-set editor for having \u201ca great ridiculous fat-bellied mind which he pats too often.\u201d Joseph Heller used Podhoretz as the model for the crass Maxwell Lieberman in his novel \u201cGood as Gold.\u201d Woody Allen cited Podhoretz's magazine in \"Annie Hall,\" joking that Commentary and the leftist Dissent had merged and renamed themselves Dysentery.",
      "Podhoretz never doubted he would be famous. Born and raised in a working class neighborhood in Brooklyn, he would credit the adoration of his family with giving him a sense of destiny. By his own account, Podhoretz was \u201cthe smartest kid in the class,\u201d brash and competitive, a natural striver who believed that \"One of the longest journeys in the world is the journey from Brooklyn to Manhattan.\"",
      "He would indeed arrive in the great borough, and beyond, thriving as an English major at Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1950, and receiving a master's degree in England from Cambridge University. By his mid-20s, he was publishing reviews in all the best magazines, from The New Yorker to Partisan Review, and socializing with Mailer, Hellman and others.",
      "He was named associate editor of Commentary in 1956, and given the top job four years later. Around the same time, he married the writer and editor Midge Decter, another future neo-conservative, and remained with her until her death in 2022.",

      "In childhood, Norman Podhoretz\u2019s world was so liberal that he later claimed he never met a Republican until high school. When Podhoretz took over Commentary, founded in 1945 by the American Jewish Committee, the magazine was a small, anti-Communist publication. Podhoretz's initial goal was to move it to the left \u2014 he serialized Paul Goodman's \"Growing Up Absurd,\" published articles advocating unilateral disarmament \u2014 and make it more intellectual, with James Baldwin, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe among the contributors. Subscriptions increased dramatically.",
      "But signs of the conservative future also appeared, and of his own confusion over a world in transition. He was a prominent critic of Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and other Beat writers, dismissing the upstart movement in 1958 as a \u201crevolt of the spiritually underprivileged\u201d and branding Kerouac a \u201cknow-nothing.\" In a 1963 essay, Podhoretz admitted to being terrified of Black people as a child, agonized over \"his own twisted feelings,\" wondered whether he, or anyone, could change and concluded that \"the wholesale merging of the two races is the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned.\"",
      "\"Making It,\" released in 1967, was a final turning point. A blunt embrace of status seeking, the book was shunned and mocked by the audience Podhoretz cared about most: New York intellectuals. Podhoretz would look back on his early years and conclude that to advance in the world one had to make a \u201cbrutal bargain\u201d with the upper classes, in part by acknowledging they were the upper classes. Friends urged him not to publish \u201cMaking It,\u201d his agent wanted nothing to do with it and his original publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, refused to promote it (Podhoretz gave back his advance and switched to Random House). Even worse, he was no longer welcome at literary parties, a deep wound for an author who had confessed that \u201cat the precocious age of 35 I experienced an astonishing revelation: It is better to be a success than a failure.\"",
      "By the end of the decade, Podhoretz was sympathizing less with the young leftists of the 1960s than with the way of life they were opposing. Like other neo-conservatives, he remained supportive of Democrats into the 1970s, but allied himself with more traditional politicians such as Edmund Muskie rather than the anti-Vietnam War candidate George McGovern. He would accuse the left of hostility to Israel and tolerance of antisemitism at home, with Gore Vidal (who called Podhoretz a \u201cpublicist for Israel\u201d) a prime target. Echoing the opinions of Decter, he also rejected the feminist and gay rights movements as symptoms of a \"plague\" among \"the kind of women who do not wish to be women and among those men who do not wish to be men.\"",
      "\u201cTact is unknown to the Podhoretzes,\u201d Vidal wrote of Podhoretz and Decter in 1986. \u201cJoyously they revel in the politics of hate.\u201d",
      "Podhoretz was close to Moynihan, and he worked on the New York Democrat's successful Senate run in 1976, when in the primary Moynihan narrowly defeated the more liberal Bella Abzug. From 1981 to 1987, during the Reagan administration, Podhoretz served as an adviser to the United States Information Agency and helped write Kirkpatrick's widely quoted 1984 convention speech that chastised those who \"blame America first.\" He was a foreign policy adviser for Republican Rudolph Giuliani's brief presidential run in 2008 and, late in life, broke again with onetime allies when he differed with other conservatives and backed Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI began to be bothered by the hatred against Trump that was building up from my soon to be new set of ex-friends,\u201d he told the Claremont Review of Books in 2019. \u201cYou could think he was unfit for office \u2014 I could understand that \u2014 but my ex-friends\u2019 revulsion was always accompanied by attacks on the people who supported him. They called them dishonorable, or opportunists or cowards \u2014 and this was done by people like Bret Stephens, Bill Kristol, various others.",
      "\u201cAnd I took offense at that. So that inclined me to what I then became: anti-anti-Trump.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military said Wednesday that it attacked a boat accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing four people on the same day the House rejected efforts to limit President Donald Trump\u2019s power to use military force against drug cartels.",
      "U.S. Southern Command stated on social media that the vessel was operated by narco-terrorists along a known trafficking route. The military didn't provide evidence behind the allegations but posted a video of a boat moving through water before there was an explosion.",
      "The attack brought the total number of known boat strikes to 26 while at least 99 people have been killed, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration. Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy former Hong Kong media mogul who has come to symbolize defiance to Beijing, would devote himself to God and his family rather than political activism if he were released, his daughter said Monday after he was convicted in a national security case.",
      "Claire Lai made an appeal for her 78-year-old father's freedom following the verdict in Hong Kong stemming from his political advocacy. He now faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life behind bars.",
      "\"He just wants to reunite with his family. He wants to dedicate his life to serving our Lord, and he wants to dedicate the rest of his days to his family,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in Washington. \u201cMy father is fundamentally not a man who operates on illegal ground.\u201d",
      "Her words, echoing an op-ed she wrote this month in The Washington Post saying her father's \u201ccrusading days are over,\" come as the legal process is nearing the end. This paves the way for a possible diplomatic solution between Beijing and Western governments, especially the White House.",
      "\u201cI feel so badly. I spoke to President Xi (Jinping) about it, and I asked to consider his release,\" Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office, referencing China's leader. Jimmy Lai is \"not well, he\u2019s an older man, and he\u2019s not well, so I did put that request out. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "Lai was arrested in August 2020 under a national security law that Beijing imposed as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent in the wake of huge anti-government protests in 2019 in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese city. Lai has spent five years in custody, much of it in solitary confinement.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media: \u201cI echo President Trump\u2019s call for Beijing to conclude this ordeal and release Mr. Lai.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guilty verdict in Mr. Lai\u2019s national security case reflects the enforcement of Beijing\u2019s laws to silence those who seek to protect freedom of speech and other fundamental rights,\u201d Rubio said in a separate statement.",
      "In London, one of Claire Lai's brothers is lobbying the British government to secure their father's freedom.",
      "\u201cRegarding the United Kingdom, we talk about normalizing relationships. Well, my father\u2019s freedom should be a precondition to that,\u201d Sebastien Lai said.",
      "Asked if he is optimistic that international pressure can help, he said, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to keep fighting no matter what. I think, taking my father\u2019s example, standing up for what is right is why we\u2019re doing it. This is my way of fighting for it.\u201d",
      "Tom Wells, spokesman for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Jimmy Lai\u2019s case has been a priority for this government and \u201cwe will continue to call for his immediate release.\u201d",
      "Lai's daughter told the AP on Monday that she envisioned her father focusing on religion if he were freed.",
      "\u201cHe started drawing pictures of the crucifixion and of the Blessed Mother in prison,\u201d Claire Lai said. \u201cAnd that is what he wants to continue doing when he\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "She said five years of solitary confinement has taken a toll on Jimmy Lai's health. Once a large and robust man, he has lost a significant amount of weight, she said.",
      "\u201cHe is a lot weaker and has only gotten weaker in the last year,\u201d said Claire Lai, who got to see her father in court and on prison visits. \u201cHe has back pains and waist pains, his nails when we visit we can tell that they\u2019re turning colors and falling off. Some of his teeth are rotting.\u201d",

      "\"I wasn't really that shy about including some of the bad stuff I did,\" Nick Reiner said during the joint interview, \"because a lot of people do things that are pretty unsavory when they're going through that, but in terms of making it a narrative, of course, it's not my life.\" He also said, \"I think I can relate to it, of course, and I hope other people can relate to it.\"",

And life at home wasn't much easier. When his parents divorced in 1957, when he was 11, he moved in with his father, who he says was emotionally and physically abusive.",
      "\"It's hard to navigate because you're going to catch it, especially when you're a bit rebellious like me. You're going to get a beating. After a while, you learn to just expect it,\" Stallone told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King during an interview inside his Florida home.",

You mold them, and you dent them, and you hurt them, or you drop them off the table, and they're not the same shape anymore,\" he said. \"I still walk around with it. And I wish I couldn't.

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

      "Hollywood stars and political leaders alike are paying homage to\u00a0Rob Reiner, the prolific movie director, actor and social activist whose shocking death has triggered a wave of heartfelt tributes online.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home in what police described as an apparent homicide. Police said Monday that their son Nick Reiner has been arrested\u00a0on murder charges.",
      "With a career that spanned multiple genres over more than five decades, Rob Reiner is considered a legend by many in the film and television industry. He rose to fame as a comedic actor in the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family,\" and his directing credits include classic titles like \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\"",
      "Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X. Reiner's coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me\" was based on King's novella \"The Body,\" and he also went on to direct the 1990 screen adaptation of the author's thriller \"Misery,\" both of which won acclaim.",
      "\"Wonderful friend, political ally, and brilliant filmmaker,\" King said. \"Rest in peace, Rob. You always stood by me.\"",
      "The actor and television host Jerry O'Connell, who was one of the young co-stars in \"Stand By Me,\" shared an photo on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0of himself and Reiner on the set of the 1986 movie. In its caption, he wrote: \"Love you Rob. Sincerely.\"",
      "In an interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" O'Connell described Reiner's death as \"surreal\" and reflected on the formative role that Reiner played in his life.",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" he said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. ... It's just a sad, shocking day.\"",
      "\"What a huge loss,\" wrote Ben Stiller, who said Reiner was one of his favorite directors and praised his \"incredible run of movies.\"",
      "\"He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,\" Stiller posted on X. \"'Spinal Tap' is one of the best  comedies ever made \u2014 and the list goes on.

      "\"Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,\" actor Virginia Madsen, who appeared in Reiner's 1996 film \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\"\u00a0wrote on Instagram.",
      "James Woods, who starred in the same film, said in a post on X\u00a0that Reiner had fought for him to play that part, and they \"remained good friends ever since.\"",
      "Actor Josh Gad called Reiner \"one of the greatest directors of our time.\" His Instagram post\u00a0included several photos of them together.",
      "\"He was a friend. He was simply a beautiful person,\" Gad captioned it. \"Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices. This loss is devastating. I cannot express how much this hurts. Love you Rob and Michelle. Thank you for all you gave us.\"",
      "Fellow director Joe Russo said he \"can't handle the truth that one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live is gone\" in\u00a0a post on X, referencing the iconic line from \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "\"We lost one of the few good men. RIP, Rob Reiner,\" Russo added.",
      "Actor and Screen Actors Guild president Sean Astin said in a news release that Reiner was \"one of those most significant figures in the history of film and television,\" whose cultural influence \"simply can't be overstated.\"",
      "\"All in the Family\" creator Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at age 101, \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary,\" Lear's family said in a statement. The family said they were \"devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\"",
      "\"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends,\" the family said.",
      "Politicians from California and beyond have spoken out to express their condolences and celebrate Reiner's accomplishments in cinema as well as political activism. Reiner was a vocal advocate for Democratic campaigns and, in California, led initiatives for LGBTQ rights and early childhood development.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Reiner and his wife \"were dear friends,\" and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, \"are devastated to learn of their passing.\" Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, said Reiner's work \"has impacted generations of Americans.\"",
      "\"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X. \"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "summary": "In their new movie, \"Song Sung Blue,\" Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson play Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life musical impersonators from Milwaukee who sang as the Neil Diamond tribute act Lightning & Thunder.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 17:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

    "story": [
      "Netflix leaders doubled down Monday on their intention to acquire part of Warner Bros. Discovery, while also looking to alleviate concerns in Hollywood about the blockbuster deal's potential impact on the movie business.",
      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery for roughly $108 billion. Unlike Netflix, Paramount is also offering to buy Warner's cable brands, which include CNN, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS and TNT.",
      "Netflix declined further comment.",
      "The company's offer has drawn criticism from lawmakers including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, who said in a statement earlier this month that a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",

      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",
      "They can typically be found near oaks and other hardwood trees, including pine trees, and are easily mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms. But neither cooking, boiling, drying or freezing them will render them safe to eat, the CDPH said.",
      "Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration can begin between six to 24 hours after eating one, and it's possible symptoms will go away after a day, but the CDPH warns the recovery is \"deceptive.\"",
      "\"Patients may still develop serious to fatal liver damage within 48 to 96 hours after eating the mushrooms,\" the CDPH said.",

    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 21:50:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Negative views of the nation's economy persist as 2025 draws to a close.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",
      "The people who are keeping purchases steady or buying more this year tend to be those who say their financial situation is good.",
      "Feelings about the holiday season",
      "Overall, the holiday season evokes more positive feelings than negative ones, with many saying they are happy and grateful.",
      "But those who are having difficulty affording holiday expenses are especially likely to report feeling stressed, too.",
      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",
      "Throughout the year, like today, Americans have had a collectively mixed outlook looking forward. Just over half of Americans expect a slowing economy or one in recession. While others expect a growing economy or one that holds steady.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,267 U.S. adults interviewed between December 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "The Oscars\u00a0ceremony is moving to YouTube starting in 2029, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u00a0announced on Wednesday.",
      "ABC, the Oscars' longtime home, will continue broadcasting the awards ceremony through 2028.",
      "\"We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,\" Academy chief executive Bill Kramer and president Lynette Howell Taylor said. \"The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible \u2014 which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.\"",
      "In a statement, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan called the Oscars \"one of our essential cultural institutions\" and said that the partnership \"to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy.\"",
      "The awards ceremony will be available on YouTube for free, the Academy said, and the platform will retain global rights to stream it through 2033. YouTube, which is owned by Google, will also be home to other Oscars events like nominations announcements.",
      "The Oscars' shift to YouTube marks a major move for awards shows away from broadcast television. The ceremony has aired on ABC since the 1970s.",
      "\"ABC has been the proud home to The Oscars for more than half a century,\" an ABC Entertainment spokesperson said in a statement after the announcement. \"We look forward to the next three telecasts, including the show's centennial celebration in 2028, and wish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences continued success.\"",

    "summary": "Wall Street analysts expect another strong year in stocks in 2026, propelled by continued AI sector gains and additional Fed interest-rate cuts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.",
      "The S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17\u2014 a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.",
      "The key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0percolate?",
      "\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"",
      "Other forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.",
      "J.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.",
      "What will drive stocks in 2026?",
      "Several catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.",
      "\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"",
      "The AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.",
      "Another area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers.",
      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"That's something we haven't seen,\" he said. \"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it.\"",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",
      "\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.",

      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers are warning travelers to beware of a range of scams that tend to proliferate during the holiday season, including phishing schemes involving phony websites, as well as criminals who impersonate airlines and hotels.",
      "Online travel fraud has surged, accounting for $1 trillion in global financial losses in 2024, according to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which issued the warning on Wednesday. For example, such scams can lead to consumers paying for fake trips or booking accommodations that look nothing like how they are pictured online.",
      "\"While the winter holidays are one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, they're also one of the busiest seasons for scammers impersonating airlines, hotels and rental platforms,\" U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, the panel's ranking member, said in a statement. \"As millions of Americans prepare to travel to see their loved ones over the next few weeks, everyone should also prepare to protect themselves against rampant travel scams.\"",
      "The JEC, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers that advises Congress on economic issues, also called on the Federal Trade Commission to indicate what steps it is taking alongside U.S. technology companies to protect consumers from overseas scam networks. Organized foreign criminals stole $10 billion from Americans in 2024, up 66% from the prior year.",
      "In a letter, the panel pressed the FTC to detail how it is working with social media sites, dating platforms, financial technology companies and other actors to disrupt travel fraud. Lawmakers also requested details on how much money the FTC has allocated to protect Americans from overseas fraud.",
      "The panel's Democratic minority cited data from travel and payment firms showing a sharp rise in online fraud around the holidays.",
      "Travel fraud is among the most common types of criminal activity, according to the\u00a0FTC, which said it accounted for $274 million in U.S. consumer losses in 2024. Research from the Mastercard Economics Institute has found that\u00a0fraud spikes by up to 28%\u00a0during peak travel seasons.",
      "Common travel scams",
      "Criminals employ a range of tactics to extract payment details or other personal information from travelers. One common ploy is to send a text message claiming that a person's flight has been canceled, according to the JEC.",
      "\"These texts, which appear to come from major airlines, direct customers to a fake number or link to rebook their travel,\" warned the panel, which advises people to verify any schedule changes with their airline.",
      "Scammers may also pose as legitimate business representatives in replying to travelers' social media posts about flight delays or other travel headaches. In addition, fraudsters are known to pay to appear in online search results, advertising phony customer service numbers that lead directly to a scammer.",
      "How to avoid getting burned",
      "The JEC advised travelers always to consult official company websites or apps when seeking information, and not to click on links sent by text or email directing them to a website. Consumers should also be leery of online ads, sponsored search results or links posted on social media, the lawmakers warned.",
      "If a travel company is unfamiliar, meanwhile, the panel advises travelers to check sites like the Better Business Bureau, where other customers can post reviews and complaints. Clues indicating a possible scam include misspelled or extra words in a website address.",
      "Consumers should also beware vendors that describe accommodations as luxurious, but don't provide details such as a hotel's name or location, the JEC said. If a company does not list its cancellation or refund policy, or requests payment in cryptocurrency, that could also be suspicious, according to the committee.",

      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-us-transcontinental-railroad-2-big-unions/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:25:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads, which would create the first U.S. transcontinental railroad, has lost the support of two major unions.",
    "story": [
      "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half their workers because they're worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision, which they plan to announce Wednesday, will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups, and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Trump.",
      "The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Unions finding fault",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and that it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives, they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs of all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\"This proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between 'Hell or the highway.'\"",
      "The unions say they're worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides in the two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they're optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Over 99% of shareholders of both lines voted in favor of the combination last month.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago, it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Outside views mixed",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",
      "Currently, Norfolk Southern and CSX serve the eastern U.S. while Union Pacific and BNSF serve the west, and the two major Canadian rails compete where they can with their tracks crossing Canada and extending down into the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"This merger is like nothing we've seen before. It's creating a railroad of such enormous scope that it's somewhat of a paradigm shift,\" Schwieterman said.",
      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",
      "\"No customer is asking for this. This is strictly a Wall Street play for shareholders,\" Andersen said.",
      "Earlier this fall, Buffett and CPKC's CEO both said they weren't interested in any kind of rail merger right now. Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

    "story": [
      "Affinity Partners, the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said Tuesday that it has dropped out of Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.",
      "The exit, first reported by Bloomberg, came a week after Paramount Skydance made the all-cash bid to Warner Bros. Discovery, just days after Netflix had\u00a0agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros.\u00a0in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "\"With\u2004two\u2004strong competitors\u2004vying to secure\u2004the future\u2004of this\u2004unique American\u2004asset,\u2004Affinity\u2004has\u2004decided no longer to pursue\u2004the opportunity,\" an Affinity spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The dynamics\u2004of the investment have changed significantly\u2004since we initially became\u2004involved\u2004in October. We\u2004continue to\u2004believe\u2004there is a strong strategic rationale for Paramount's offer.\"",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "In addition to Affinity, Paramount Skydance's bid had other outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Qatar Investment Authority.",
      "Affinity's role in the Paramount offer generated some criticism over the firm's connection to Mr. Trump, and some Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns over foreign money in America's largest media companies.",
      "\"I'm deeply concerned about the implications here for data privacy, democracy and our media ecosystem,\" Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said last week in a joint letter to Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing. Mr. Trump has also said he plans to be involved in the government approval process of a deal. The president had signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" He also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Regardless of Paramount Skydance's bid, Netflix had already reached an agreement to purchase some of Warner Bros. Discovery, including the film studio and streaming service HBO Max.",
      "Netflix's deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Newly released financial documents and photos obtained from the estate of convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0are reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The photos, released Dec. 12 by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, include images of prominent figures such as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Earlier in the month, the same committee had released financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as photos and videos of the financier's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018.",
      "Separately from the Oversight Committee's document release, Congress has passed a bill last month giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. President Trump signed the bill into law on Nov. 19.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has proved politically sensitive\u00a0after Mr. Trump returned to office in January of 2025. The president had earlier urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue, initially describing the effort to release more records as a distraction tactic, but reversed his stance in November.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has been accused of no wrongdoing, had been friends with Epstein but later cut his ties with the businessman.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank in 2023 for a reported $290 million. The money was slated to go to almost 200 Epstein victims, according to the New York Times.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "In October, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, pointed to\u00a0$1.5 billion in suspicious financial transactions that had been flagged by the banks and were tied to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking crimes. The same month, Bank of America was sued by one of Epstein's victims, who alleged the bank facilitated and also benefited from his alleged crimes.",
      "Bank of America had no comment on the lawsuit.",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Hyundai and Kia owners can get free repairs under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.",
      "The settlement comes after a rash of Hyundai and Kia thefts prompted nearly two dozen state attorneys general in 2023 to demand the automakers take action.",
      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "story": [
      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",

    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

      "Four of the nation's top retail stores failed to promptly pull contaminated infant formula tied to a dangerous botulism outbreak from their shelves, federal health officials said in warning letters posted Monday.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent letters to leaders at Walmart, Target, Kroger and Albertsons saying the companies continued to sell ByHeart infant formula for days or weeks, despite a Nov. 11 recall of all products in the outbreak that has sickened more than 50 babies in 19 states.",
      "\"As a participant in the supply chain, your firm should take prompt and effective action when notified of a product recall,\" FDA officials said in warning letters sent to the companies on Dec. 12 and posted online Monday.",
      "The formula was found at Target stores in 20 states \"well after the recall was initiated,\" one letter said. In addition, it was sold at a Target store in New Hampshire on Nov. 16, despite an electronic block on the product's sales code, the FDA noted. And at a Target store in Arkansas, single-serve packs of ByHeart formula were promoted with a \"Sale!\" sign and a $2 discount from Nov. 16 to Nov. 22.",
      "Information from state and local health officials said ByHeart formula was found at Walmart stores in 21 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26. The formula was found in Albertsons stores in 11 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19, and at Kroger stores in 10 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19.",
      "In addition, the companies failed to provide FDA with evidence that corrective actions have been put in place, despite multiple requests, the agency said. The companies have 15 working days to respond to the letters.",
      "Walmart officials said in a statement that no ByHeart formula was sold after cash registers were blocked from selling the formula following the recall.",
      "\"We moved swiftly to issue a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores and clubs and online,\" a company spokesperson said in an email. \"We take all reports of inaction seriously and will respond to the letter.\"",

      "All babies in the outbreak have been hospitalized and treated with an IV medication to stop the progress of the disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the outbreak to include all babies treated for botulism after consuming ByHeart formula since it was first produced in 2023.",
      "Steven Mandernach, executive director at the Association of Food and Drug Officials, said the FDA itself was slow to distribute information about the recall with state and local food safety officials. The agency didn't fully share product lists until Nov. 14, nearly a week after the initial recall of two lots of ByHeart formula on Nov. 8.",

Instead of compensating these workers fairly for their labor, UPS has played the Grinch.\"",

      "\"We offer industry-leading pay and benefits to our more than 26,000 employees in New York, and we remain committed to following all applicable laws,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",

      "UPS allegedly failed to pay seasonal workers for all of the hours they worked, according to the civil lawsuit, which was filed in New York state court.

      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 07:02:04 -0500",
    "summary": "North Carolina was among the GOP-led states this year that redrew congressional lines mid-decade in an attempt to benefit Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina Republicans redrew the state's congressional maps this fall, in the hopes of improving their chances at ousting a Democrat in one of the country's most competitive districts.",
      "In doing so, they may have created a window for a Democrat to make what has been a reliably Republican neighboring seat more competitive.",
      "CBS News has learned that Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran, plans to file Thursday for North Carolina's third congressional district seat. The race in the South could become a key contest in Democrats' quest to win back a majority next fall in the U.S. House.",
      "\"I'm running for Congress because the people of North Carolina's 3rd congressional district deserve someone who will show up and fight for them,\" Jaslow said in a campaign statement.",
      "GOP Rep. Greg Murphy has held the seat since a summer 2019 special election, and won another term in the 2024 election with more than 77% of the vote.",
      "But the physician's political future became a bit more muddled this fall, after Republican legislators in Raleigh changed the boundaries of his seat in an attempt to make the Democratic-held 1st Congressional District more favorable to Republicans. In part, the new map transferred a large swath of the eastern portion of Murphy's 3rd Congressional District to the 1st District, which is held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis.",
      "GOP leaders made the move as similar efforts played out around the country to try to protect the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House.",
      "Murphy announced afterwards that he would run for another term in Congress and was soon endorsed by President Trump.",
      "\"I am very excited about serving my old friends again in Greene, Lenoir and eastern Wayne while looking forward to new friendships in western Wayne and Wilson County,\" Murphy said in a statement at the time. \"These new counties will further strengthen my commitment to our beloved veterans and active-duty military, local manufacturing interests as well as North Carolina's cherished and vital agricultural economy.\"",
      "While the 1st and 3rd Districts are both still viewed as Republican-leaning areas, the impact brought about by redistricting isn't without political risk for conservatives.",
      "Murphy's district is now 43% Democratic, up from 39% Democratic before it was redrawn, whereas Davis' seat went from being 48% to 44% Democratic, according to a CBS News analysis of 2024 presidential election data.",
      "Mr. Trump has won North Carolina in the last three presidential elections, though each of the races in the state has been close. He has offered his support to Murphy.",
      "\"Greg knows the Wisdom and Courage required to Defend our Country, Support our Brave Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,\" Trump said in an October social media post.",
      "Hefty political spending is already expected to head to the state for next year's midterms, where former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper represents his party's best chance at winning back a GOP-held seat in the Senate. To have a reasonable shot at defeating Murphy, Democrats will likely need plenty to break their way, along with the typical political gravity of an incumbent president's party struggling in the midterms.",
      "Jaslow also brings a notable biography to the contest. Until earlier this year, she had worked as the CEO of The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. In announcing her departure, a news release described her as having \"made history in 2023 as the first woman and first openly gay veteran to lead a major veterans service organization.\"",
      "As of Thursday, she does not live in the district, but is expected to soon.",
      "And in opening her campaign, Jaslow made clear what kind of focus she plans to take against the Republican incumbent within this newly shaped North Carolina district.",
      "\"As an American who has dedicated my life to serving my country, first in uniform and with the responsibility of leading soldiers in wartime, I'm furious that Greg Murphy seems to believe that public service is about serving himself and his friends and not his constituents,\" Jaslow said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Every night, Abdullah Ibrahim retreats from the streets into a wooded stretch along the Potomac River.",
      "As night falls and temperatures drop, he erects a tent and builds a fire beneath a canopy of pine, hemlock, and cedar trees.",
      "He evades authorities by rotating use of three tents of different colors at three campsites. As day breaks, he dismantles his shelter, rolls up his belongings, and hides them for the next night. \"They don't see you if you're in the woods,\" the 32-year-old said. \"But make sure it's broken down by morning or they'll find you.\"",
      "During the day, he wanders, stopping at a public library to warm up or a soup kitchen to eat. What's important is to not draw attention to himself for being homeless.",
      "\"Police want us out of the way,\" he said, dressed in a gray jacket and carrying none of his possessions. \"Out of sight, out of mind.\"",
      "Ibrahim has been deliberate about blending in since August, when President Trump placed the district's police under federal control and ordered National Guard soldiers to patrol its streets. The president also ordered homeless people to leave immediately. \"There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY,'\" he posted.",
      "The Trump administration says encampment sweeps have reduced the visibility of homelessness, thereby enhancing the city. \"There is no disputing that Washington, DC is a safer, cleaner, and more beautiful city thanks to President Trump's historic actions to restore the nation's capital,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.",
      "While there may appear to be fewer homeless people in the nation's capital now, they have not disappeared.",
      "In interviews, homeless people said they are in a constant shuffle, hiding in plain sight. During the day, they stay on the move, grabbing meals at soup kitchens and resting on occasion in public libraries, on park benches, or at bus stops. At night, many unsheltered people bed down in business doorways, on park sidewalks, and on church stoops. Some ride the bus all night, while a few shelter in emergency rooms. Others find respite in the woods or flee to suburbs in Virginia or Maryland.",
      "There are about 5,100 homeless people in Washington, D.C., including in temporary shelters, according to an early-2025 homelessness tally. After Mr. Trump ordered the crackdown on public homelessness, people living in makeshift communities scattered and are now living in the shadows. City officials estimated in August that nearly 700 homeless people were living outdoors without tents or other shelter.",
      "As winter draws near, they are exposed to the elements and grow sicker as chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease go untreated. Street medicine providers say that, since the National Guard was deployed, they have faced enormous difficulty finding patients. Many caught up in sweeps have had their lifesaving medications thrown away, and they are more likely to miss medical appointments because they are constantly on the move. Street medicine providers say they can't find their patients to deliver medication or transport them to medical appointments. The constant chaos can suck patients with mental illness and substance use deeper into drug and alcohol addiction, raising the risk of overdose.",
      "Caseworkers report similar disruptions, saying as clients get lost, they break connections essential for obtaining housing documents, particularly IDs and Social Security cards.",
      "District officials and health providers say this cascade will make homelessness worse, threatening public health and public safety and racking up enormous costs for the health care system.",
      "\"It was already hard locating people, but the federal presence just made it worse,\" said Tobie Smith, a street medicine doctor and the executive director of Street Health D.C.",
      "The homeless shuffle",
      "Chris Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but now is homeless, having been pushed out of his tent near the White House in the initial days of the federal homelessness crackdown. He said two of his tents were taken during sweeps. Now, sleeping on a sidewalk outside a church, he doesn't bother trying to get another one. \"Why? What's the point? It'll just get thrown away again.\"",
      "Jones, 57, has a severe knee injury that prevents him from walking some days and said he was scheduled for a knee replacement in December. He said it's important to stay where he is \u2014 he relies on a nearby drugstore to refill his medications for bipolar disorder, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When he's hungry, he goes to a soup kitchen for a meal or tries to get a cheeseburger and a soda from a fast-food joint across the street.",
      "It's important for him to stay outside the church, he said, so his case manager can find him when a permanent housing slot opens up. If it gets too cold, he said, he will cross the street and sleep in the doorway of a business, which can provide a bit more shelter. He wants to get indoors, but for now, he waits.",
      "Since taking control of Washington's police force, the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on cities and counties across the nation to clear homeless encampments under threat of arrest, citation, or detention. It has ordered or threatened similar National Guard deployments in Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and other cities with large homeless populations.",
      "Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said the president is maintaining National Guard and federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital \"to ensure the long-term success of the federal operation.\" Since March, city and federal officials have removed more than 130 homeless encampments, she said, though some local homelessness experts say that number could be inflated.",
      "The Supreme Court last year made it easier for elected officials and law enforcement to fine or arrest homeless people for living outside. Then, in July of this year, the president issued an executive order calling for a nationwide crackdown on urban camping, including a massive removal of people living outdoors and forced mental health or substance use treatment.",
      "President Trump is also spearheading an overhaul of homelessness policy, moving to slash funding for permanent housing and services for homeless people. The move would limit the use of a long-standing federal policy known as \"Housing First\" that offers housing without mandating mental health or addiction treatment. The National Alliance to End Homelessness warns the move risks displacing at least 170,000 people in permanent supportive housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development paused the plan on Dec. 8 to make revisions, which it \"intends\" to do, federal housing officials said.",
      "City officials say they are complying with the Trump administration's forceful campaign against homeless people sheltering outside. Pressured by the White House, local officials said they've gotten more aggressive in breaking up camps. Advocates for homeless people say some of the sweeps have been conducted at night and others with little or no notice to move. City leaders believe they could be done more compassionately by offering services and shelter.",
      "\"We've pivoted from the notion of allowing encampments if they didn't violate public health or safety to a position of, 'We don't want you in the streets,'\" said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for District of Columbia Health and Human Services, who oversees encampment cleanups. \"It's unsafe, it's unhealthy, and it's dangerous.\" Yet he acknowledges the encampment sweeps can waste city resources as caseworkers and street medicine providers scramble to find their clients and patients.",
      "Advocates say the Trump administration is inciting fear and mistrust between homeless people and those working to help them while wasting taxpayer dollars used to provide care and place people into housing. There are, however, far fewer tents and large-scale encampments visible to tourists and residents.",
      "\"People found safety in those communities and service providers could find them. Now there are people with guns and flashing lights dislocating folks experiencing homelessness without notice and just throwing stuff away,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center.",
      "District officials say some people have accepted emergency shelter. But even as the city works to connect people with services and expand shelter capacity, officials acknowledge there isn't enough permanent housing or temporary beds for everyone.",
      "And there will be fewer places for people living outside to go.",
      "The city, in its fiscal year 2026 budget, concentrated its homelessness funding on families, funding 336 new permanent supportive housing vouchers. Yet it cut funding for temporary housing for both families and individuals and provided no new permanent supportive housing vouchers for individuals. That means fewer housing slots for single adults, who make up most of those wandering the streets. City officials said, however, that they have slotted 260 more permanent housing units for homeless individuals or families into their construction pipeline.",
      "Worsening health care",
      "The fallout is inundating local soup kitchens with demand, including Miriam's Kitchen in Foggy Bottom. The local institution provides hot meals, housing assistance, and warm blankets to people in need.",
      "Caseworkers say it's becoming increasingly difficult to help clients secure IDs and other documents needed for housing and other social services.",
      "\"I'm looking everywhere, but I can't find people,\" said Cyria Knight, a case worker at Miriam's Kitchen. \"Most of my clients went to Virginia.\"",
      "It's unclear how much of the district's homeless population has fanned out to neighboring Virginia and Maryland communities. There were an estimated 9,700 homeless people in the region in January, months before the Trump crackdown. Four of six counties around Washington saw homelessness rise from 2024, while it fell 9% in the district.",
      "\"I'm not seeing my patients for a month or more, and then when I do, their chronic conditions are uncontrolled. They've been in and out of the ER, and they're more likely to be hospitalized,\" said Anna Graham, a street medicine nurse practitioner for Unity Health Care, a network of clinics in Washington. \"It's just setting us back.\"",
      "Graham's team stations its mobile medical van outside Miriam's Kitchen at dinnertime to better find patients.",
      "Willie Taylor, 63, was figuring out where to sleep for the night after grabbing dinner from Miriam's. He saw Graham to receive his medications for advanced lung disease, seizures, chronic pain, and other health disorders.",
      "He has difficulty walking and needs a wheelchair, which is complicated because he doesn't have a permanent address. Taylor and his medical providers say his previous wheelchairs have been stolen while he slept outdoors at night. He uses a shopping cart to keep him steady, walking around all day, until nightfall.",
      "On a cold November night, Graham helped Taylor figure out his daily medications and checked his vitals. The team handed him a warm coat and hand warmers before sending him back outside.",
      "After walking for about 45 minutes, he found a piece of park pavement where he could build a bed out of tarps and sleeping bags.",
      "\"My body can't take this,\" Taylor said, preparing to sleep. \"There's ice on the concrete. I'm in so much pain; it hurts so much worse when it's cold.\"",
      "Homeless people die younger and cost the health care system more than housed people, largely because conditions go untreated on the streets, and when they do seek care, many go to the ER. Among Medicaid enrollees, homeless people have been estimated to incur $18,764 a year in spending, compared with $7,561 for other enrollees.",
      "Over at the So Others Might Eat soup kitchen earlier that day, Tyree Kelley was finishing his breakfast of a sausage sandwich and hard-boiled eggs. He was considering going into a shelter. The streets were becoming too dangerous for someone like him, he said, referring to the police and National Guard presence. He was feeling the loss of an encampment community that would watch his back.",
      "He's been to the ER at least seven times this year to get care for a broken ankle he sustained falling off an electric scooter. The accident caused him to lose his job and health insurance as a garbageman, he said. His situation has caused him to sink deeper into a depression that began three years ago after his mother died, he said.",
      "Then his father and sister died this year. He began to numb his pain with beer.",
      "\"You get so depressed, being out here,\" said Kelley, 42. \"It gets addictive. You start to not care about even changing your clothes.\"",
      "His depression also led him to seek out marijuana. Then he smoked a joint laced with fentanyl. The overdose sent him to the hospital for days.",
      "\"I actually died and came back,\" he said, crediting other homeless people with administering naloxone and saving his life. \"I need to get out of this, but I feel so stuck.\"",
      "A few blocks west of the White House sits a vacant plot of land that earlier this year held more than a dozen tents. Workers in the area sense what they don't always see.",
      "\"I was here when this was all cleared. A bulldozer came in, and all their stuff was thrown in a garbage truck,\" said Ray Szemborski, who works across the street from the now-empty lot. \"People are still homeless. I still see them around underneath the bridge. Sometimes they're at bus stops, sometimes just walking around. Their tents are gone but they're still here.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would reschedule marijuana to a lower drug classification, according to two sources familiar with the planning, in one of the most significant changes to drug policy in decades.",
      "One source cautioned that while the plan is for the order to be signed Thursday, the timing could shift.",
      "The order is expected to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Schedule I applies to substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" \u2014 the agency's most stringent classification, which is also for heroin, LSD and ecstasy in addition to marijuana.",
      "The DEA uses Schedule III for substances \"with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" Other Schedule III drugs include Tylenol with codeine, testosterone, anabolic steroids and ketamine",
      "Moving the drug to a lower schedule would not change the fact that it remains illegal for recreational use at the federal level. But it could open the door to more research into marijuana and expanded medical uses. It might also lower the tax burden for state-licensed marijuana dispensaries in the dozens of states that have legalized the drug, since federal law bars businesses that sell Schedule I substances from taking some tax deductions.",
      "Mr. Trump said Monday he is \"considering\" moving marijuana to a different schedule because there are \"tremendous amounts of research that can't be done unless you reclassify.\"",
      "\"Rescheduling will help accelerate research, reduce stigma, attract new investment, and ease some of the tax burdens that have held the industry back. The next transformation will happen when interstate commerce barriers between states are removed,\" said Vince C. Ning, the co-CEO and co-founder of cannabis wholesale platform Nabis.",
      "CNN first reported that the executive order is planned for Thursday.",
      "The president said during his campaign last year that he believes marijuana should instead be a Schedule III drug.",
      "The Biden-era Department of Health and Human Services also recommended bumping marijuana down to Schedule III. The Justice Department, the DEA's parent agency, proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana last year, but the process became mired in over a year of legal and administrative wrangling, leaving the drug in Schedule I status.",
      "Marijuana has been deemed a Schedule I drug since the classification system was created in 1970. In recent years, however, most states have approved the drug for certain medical uses, and 24 states have legalized the drug recreationally. These state policies technically clash with federal law, but the federal government has opted against cracking down on cannabis businesses that are licensed by states.",
      "Some members of both parties have backed looser federal marijuana regulations, often pointing to potential medical benefits \u2014 and polling that shows Americans are increasingly supportive of legalizing medical or recreational uses of the drug.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump said he planned to vote yes on an unsuccessful Florida ballot measure to legalize marijuana recreationally in the state. The measure drew just under 56% of the vote, falling short of the 60% needed to pass.",
      "\"I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product,\" the president wrote on Truth Social last year.",
      "But some lawmakers remain wary. A group of 22 Republican senators penned an open letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday urging him to leave marijuana in the Schedule I category, pointing to health concerns along with worries about intoxicated driving and worker absenteeism.",
      "\"We cannot reindustrialize America if we encourage marijuana use,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\"",
      "A group of nine House Republicans penned a letter over the summer urging Attorney General Pam Bondi not to shift marijuana to a lower schedule, arguing \"there is no adequate science or data\" to support the change.",
      "\"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter states. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"",

      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,\" Southern Command said.",
      "The victims were described as \"four male narco-terrorists.\" The U.S. military provided no evidence to support allegations that the boat was ferrying drugs.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted 26 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific or Caribbean since Sept. 2, killing at least 99 people, according to the Pentagon.",
      "In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny on the strikes after the White House, following a report by The Washington Post, confirmed that in the Sept. 2 attack, the same boat was struck twice, or what has been described as a \"double tap\" or follow-on strike.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that the follow-on strike killed two people who had survived the first strike and were waving overhead. A separate source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the two survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat.",
      "A total of 11 people were killed by both strikes on Sept. 2, according to the U.S. military.",
      "While video of the Sept. 2 strikes has been shown to some congressional lawmakers in classified briefings, there has been a push for the Pentagon to release the video publicly. However, Hegseth, speaking Tuesday on Capitol Hill,\u00a0said he would not do so.",
      "\"Of course we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,\" Hegseth told reporters.",
      "Some lawmakers and legal experts have contended that the second strike could constitute a war crime.",
      "The vessel strikes have been part of a pressure campaign by the Trump administration on embattled Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom it accuses of being involved in trafficking drugs to the U.S. and collaborating with drug cartels. Venezuela has criticized the boat strikes, and Maduro denies working with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",
      "The U.S. has significantly ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean and near Latin America, and President Trump has said he will not rule out either sending troops to Venezuela or conducting land strikes there.",
      "The U.S. military seized a sanctioned oil tanker near Venezuela last week. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump announced\u00a0he had ordered a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers entering or departing Venezuela.",
      "On Wednesday, an effort by House Democrats to force votes on two war powers resolutions that would limit the president's authority to strike Venezuela or continue conducting strikes on alleged drug-running boats failed.",

    "summary": "Negative views of the nation's economy persist as 2025 draws to a close.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",
      "The people who are keeping purchases steady or buying more this year tend to be those who say their financial situation is good.",
      "Feelings about the holiday season",
      "Overall, the holiday season evokes more positive feelings than negative ones, with many saying they are happy and grateful.",
      "But those who are having difficulty affording holiday expenses are especially likely to report feeling stressed, too.",
      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",
      "Throughout the year, like today, Americans have had a collectively mixed outlook looking forward. Just over half of Americans expect a slowing economy or one in recession. While others expect a growing economy or one that holds steady.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,267 U.S. adults interviewed between December 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The latest Democratic-led attempt to limit President Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region failed Wednesday, as tensions with the South American country continue to escalate.",
      "House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump has warned that land strikes against the country could commence \"soon.\" Mr. Trump's threats come amid a months-long military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 95 people.",
      "Both measures fell short.",
      "The first measure, introduced by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, would remove U.S. armed forces \"from hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere,\" unless Congress has declared war or authorized the use of military force for such purposes. It failed in a 210 to 216 vote.",
      "A second measure from Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts would remove the armed forces \"from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" Some 211 voted in favor and 213 voted against it.",
      "Meeks' resolution had the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Don Bacon of Nebraska, while Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against it.",
      "Three Republicans \u2014 Massie, Bacon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 supported McGovern's resolution. Cuellar was the lone Democrat to vote against.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. But the White House has suggested that the decades-old law does not apply to the boat strikes because it does not view the attacks as putting service members in harm's way.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held two separate classified briefings Tuesday for all senators and House members. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee received a more detailed briefing on Wednesday with Navy Adm. Frank Bradley, who ordered a second strike killing survivors of the initial Sept. 2 boat attack.",
      "Meeks left Tuesday's House briefing saying members received no adequate explanation for why the Trump administration has not consulted Congress before the strikes. He also questioned the president's motivations.",
      "\"It doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking,\" Meeks told reporters Tuesday. \"So if this is about regime change, it seems to me that the administration should say that's what it is, and should come to Congress to ask for that authorization, which has not taken place.\"",
      "Bacon said after Wednesday's briefing that he would vote to authorize military action against Venezuela, but he still believes that Mr. Trump needs to get approval from Congress.",
      "\"I think there's enough support in Congress to pass an authorization,\" Bacon added. \"The mission is right, but continued hostilities does require congressional approval.\"",
      "A day before the votes, Vanity Fair published a piece based on nearly a dozen interviews with Mr. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, in which she said the president \"wants to keep on blowing boats up until [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.\"",
      "The statement appeared to be in contradiction with the administration's stance that it is conducting the strikes to stop the flow of drugs to the U.S., not ousting Maduro.",
      "Wiles conceded that strikes on land would require congressional approval.",
      "\"If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then [we'd need] Congress,\" she told Vanity Fair.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"very concerned\" about the U.S. actions around Venezuela.",
      "\"At this point, we still don't have a clear idea of what the president is trying to accomplish,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"But it sure looks like he's trying to accomplish regime change in Venezuela, and that he's willing to go to war and accomplish that, all without any congressional authorization.\"",
      "In a further escalation of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Maduro, the president on Tuesday said he was declaring the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization\" and called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that the president has the authority to order the boat strikes under his constitutional authority.",
      "\"It is certainly appropriate,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. \"It's necessary to protect the United States and our interests.\"",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued the president does not need congressional authorization to carry out \"precise, limited strikes.\"",
      "\"This president wants to be the judge, jury and the executioner,\" said Meeks, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat.",

    "story": [
      "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino will be leaving his role in January, he announced in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "\"I want to thank President Trump, AG Bondi, and Director Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose,\" Bongino wrote in a post on X. \"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you.\"",
      "President Trump appeared to confirm Bongino's exit earlier Wednesday, telling reporters: \"Dan did a great job. I think he wants to go back to his show.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel called Bongino \"the best partner I could've asked for in helping restore this FBI,\" writing on X that he \"not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it.\"",
      "\"We will miss him but I'm thankful he accepted the call to serve. Our country is better and safer for it,\" Patel wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also thanked Bongino, writing on social media that \"Americans are safer\" because of his service.",
      "The former Secret Service agent and conservative pundit's departure from the FBI ends a tumultuous tenure with the Bureau.",
      "Bongino was named to his post in February by Mr. Trump, and helped oversee the firing of hundreds of career FBI personnel alongside FBI Director Patel.",
      "In May, Bongino gave an interview to \"Fox & Friends\" where he spoke about the difficulties of adjusting to work at the Bureau.",
      "\"The biggest lifestyle change is family-wise,\" Bongino said. \"It was a lot, and it's been tough on the family. People ask all the time, do you like it? No. I don't.\" At another time during the interview, Bongino said, \"I gave up everything for this.\"",
      "Over the summer, Bongino clashed with other Trump administration staffers over a Justice Department and FBI review of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.",
      "As a political pundit, Bongino had pushed the government to release more evidence on Epstein and suggested a cover-up was afoot. But during his time atop the FBI, the agency's review found that Epstein had no \"client list\" and there was no evidence to support charges against others \u2014 findings that frustrated some Trump allies.",
      "Sources told CBS News at the time that Bongino attended a White House meeting in July with Attorney General Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles focusing on the fallout of the review. That discussion resulted in a confrontation with Bondi, and at the time, Bongino was weighing whether to resign from his role.",
      "Weeks later, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey was tapped by Mr. Trump to share the role of co-deputy director with Bongino.",
      "Typically, the FBI deputy director role has been a career staffer at the Bureau, but neither of the Trump administration's selections for the role had a history with the FBI before being appointed.",
      "In his role at the FBI, Bongino led a charge to reexamine unsolved high-profile cases, including the 2021 D.C pipe bombings. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested the man suspected of planting pipe bombs outside of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021. Investigators have not revealed a potential motive yet, and court proceedings in the case have just begun.",
      "For years, Bongino spread a conspiracy theory that the act may have been an \"inside job\" and that the bombs were planted by federal law enforcement.",

    "story": [
      "Ghislaine Maxwell asked a federal judge on Wednesday to vacate her 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges, just two days before the federal government is expected to release a massive trove of documents on her associate, Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "In the 50-page Manhattan court filing, Maxwell points to several alleged issues with her case, including a juror in her trial who later revealed that he was a sexual abuse victim, a piece of exculpatory evidence that she says was not made available to her and the long gap between the conduct she was charged with and her eventual indictment.",
      "The filing also resurfaces a controversial 2007 deal between Epstein and federal prosecutors in Florida, in which the prosecutors agreed not to charge Epstein or any co-conspirators. Maxwell and her attorneys have long argued that the non-prosecution agreement should apply to her, which the government has rejected.",
      "Maxwell's petition of habeas corpus \u2014 which she filed and signed herself \u2014 marks her latest attempt to reverse her guilty verdict and 20-year prison sentence, as most of her other legal avenues close. An appeals court upheld her conviction last year, and the Supreme Court\u00a0declined to take up her case\u00a0in October.",
      "The 63-year-old contends that new evidence has emerged in support of her arguments.",
      "\"The newly discovered evidence referenced above is such that when taken as a whole it constitutes a miscarriage of justice in that, the Petitioner did not receive a fair trial by independent jurors coming to Court with an open mind,\" she wrote.",
      "Her request comes ahead of a Friday deadline for the Justice Department to release virtually all of its files on its investigations into Epstein, in accordance with a law passed by Congress and\u00a0signed by President Trump last month. Maxwell's attorney told CBS News on Wednesday that he will not make any requests to block release of the Epstein files.",
      "Courts have previously pushed back on several of Maxwell's arguments for relief. A panel of appeals court judges found last year that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement didn't prevent prosecutors in Manhattan from charging Maxwell. A judge in 2022\u00a0also rejected her request for a new trial on the grounds that a juror didn't disclose his prior sexual abuse, which the appellate court upheld.",
      "Maxwell is currently serving her sentence at a minimum-security federal correctional facility in Texas. She was moved there from a low-security facility in Florida over the summer, drawing controversy. A reason was not given for her transfer.",
      "Prosecutors say Maxwell conspired with Epstein to recruit and abuse underage victims. Epstein himself was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, the year before Maxwell's indictment, but Epstein died by suicide in federal custody while awaiting trial.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that sought to require members of Congress to submit requests a week before visiting and inspecting Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the policy likely violated an appropriations law passed by Congress saying that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, cannot use funds to require lawmakers in Congress to \"provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility\" to conduct oversight.",
      "That DHS policy, announced in June, said members of Congress should file requests to inspect ICE facilities a minimum of seven days before making the visit, and that only Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could waive that requirement. Before that policy, ICE had historically allowed members of Congress to visit ICE facilities, without prior notice.",
      "\"Contrary to Defendants' suggestion, then, (appropriations law) does entitle Members of Congress to access ICE facilities without being subject to a notice requirement,\" Cobb wrote in her ruling Wednesday.",
      "The D.C.-based judge's order stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the groups Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight on behalf of a dozen Democratic lawmakers in Congress who attempted to inspect ICE detention centers.",
      "In a statement, New York Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said Wednesday's order vindicated lawmakers' \"statutory right to conduct oversight.\"",
      "\"For months, masked, unidentified ICE agents have detained law-abiding immigrants in inhumane and unconstitutional conditions, while DHS has repeatedly and unlawfully blocked me and other Members of Congress from inspecting these facilities,\" Goldman said.",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives for DHS seeking comment.",
      "Previously, the Trump administration has argued ICE detention site visits by members of Congress should not interfere with President Trump's constitutional powers. It has also accused Democratic lawmakers of going to ICE facilities for political purposes.",
      "The Justice Department charged Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey with assaulting law enforcement during a clash at an ICE detention facility in Newark. McIver has called the charges politically motivated.",
      "Wednesday's order also suspended a Trump administration policy that argued ICE field offices were not detention centers and thus not subject to unfettered congressional oversight. Democratic lawmakers have argued those facilities, even though they're not long-term detention centers, should be subject to inspections since they have been used to hold detainees for days in some cities, including in New York.",
      "The ruling comes amid a historic expansion of ICE's detention system under the second Trump administration.",
      "As of Nov. 30, ICE was holding roughly 66,000 individuals facing deportation in detention centers across the U.S., an all-time high, according to agency figures. Roughly 47% of those detainees lacked criminal records and were being held solely due to civil violations of immigration law. Some 26% of the detainees had criminal convictions and the other 26% had pending charges, the statistics show.",

    "summary": "Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, saying \"the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.\"",
      "Smith was subpoenaed to testify earlier this month by the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel during the Biden administration. The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of Mr. Trump led by Smith.",
      "Following the question-and-answer session, Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Panel, said Smith answered every question to \"the satisfaction of any reasonable minded person in that room.\"",
      "Smith \"spent several hours schooling the Judiciary Committee on the professional responsibilities of a prosecutor and the ethical duties of a prosecutor,\" Raskin said. \"And he's a sensational and honorable public servant, and we are lucky to have him in the bar in the United States.\"",
      "Rep. Daniel Goldman, a Democrat from New York, criticized Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jim Jordan for having Smith testify behind closed doors first. Previous special counsels, including Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have appeared before lawmakers for public hearings. Mueller investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Hur probed former President Joe Biden's handling of sensitive government documents.",
      "\"The accusations against him are complete bogus, and the American people should hear that for themselves,\" he said.",
      "The president was indicted on more than 40 federal charges in two separate cases. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The president has denied wrongdoing and claimed Smith's investigations were politically motivated \"witch hunts\" that intended to harm his candidacy for the White House.",
      "Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "In portions of Smith's opening statement to the committee obtained by CBS News, the former special counsel defended his prosecutorial record and told lawmakers that he made decisions in the investigations \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "\"The decision to bring charges against President Trump was mine, but the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions, as alleged in the indictments returned by grand juries in two different districts,\" Smith told lawmakers.",
      "He continued: \"Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "Smith said the documents investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, Smith said, \"then repeatedly tried to obstruct justice to conceal his continued retention of those documents.\"",
      "In other portions of his opening statement, Smith defended investigative steps taken by his team, including obtaining phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers as part of the 2020 election probe. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, published a document in October alleging that the FBI obtained phone data from eight GOP senators and one Republican House member as part of the probe.",
      "The records, Smith said, \"were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation.\"",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith said. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",

    "summary": "Military investigators found more than a dozen Navy SEALs had been in a group chat containing racist memes targeting a Black SEAL.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Navy quietly disciplined 18 Navy SEALs earlier this year after military investigators found a private group chat that contained racist memes targeting a Black SEAL who was also in the chat, according to documents and a Naval Special Warfare spokesperson.",
      "Using the Freedom of Information Act, CBS News obtained the Navy's investigation into members of SEAL Team Four, along with years of the unit's internal surveys, which give naval officers insight into the culture, morale and effectiveness. The investigation and other records show racial harassment towards one of the team's own members inside a force that prides itself on unit cohesion and honor\u2014prompting action from the top commander.",
      "One racist meme sent to the SEAL in 2022 was described in the investigation as \"Slave in Chains.\" Another meme sent in 2022 was titled \"Monkey Face\" and depicted the SEAL in uniform with his face distorted to look like a monkey. A meme sent in 2023 compared him to the movie character Radio, a mentally disabled man played by Cuba Gooding Jr.",
      "The full results of the Navy's investigation and the internal surveys have not been reported on until now. The After-Action Report, a national security blog on Substack, first reported on the memes, earlier this year.",
      "The punishments ranged from reduction in rank and forfeiture of pay to administrative measures, like formal letters of instruction and counseling, according to the Navy spokesperson.",
      "CBS News has learned that Rear Adm. Milton Sands, then the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, acted swiftly once the allegations surfaced in March. Sands has since been removed from his position by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The reason for his removal is unknown.",
      "Attorney William Brown of the Parlatore Law Group and a former Navy SEAL himself told CBS News in a phone interview that what happened at SEAL Team Four violates \"everything the Teams stand for,\" and he praised Rear Adm. Sands and other naval special warfare leaders for taking \"unprecedented action\" in this case.",
      "\"This was not a SEAL Team Four issue; it was a platoon-level leadership failure, but Sands took action and the system worked,\" said Brown, who represented the SEAL pro bono.",
      "Brown said Sands and other senior leaders inside the command moved to support the Black SEAL and to send a message to the wider naval special operations community that racist conduct would carry severe consequences. Brown lauded Sands for his leadership in the case, despite the fact that he has had public disagreements with the two-star admiral on other issues.",
      "Sands has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "The Navy launched an investigation into the memes and messages, originally shared in a private Signal group chat between 2021 and 2024, when they were raised in complaints filed by the Black SEAL in March.",
      "The SEAL wrote in the harassment complaint that before joining his platoon, he had not experienced any racial discrimination and had \"great mentors\" while undergoing the notoriously grueling training to become a qualified SEAL, which takes Naval candidates roughly two years to complete.",
      "But after he joined, \"the racism I experienced\u2026was persistent, targeted and deeply dehumanizing,\" wrote the SEAL. \"It wasn't just an attack on me personally \u2014 it reflected a breakdown in the very discipline and integrity the Teams are supposed to uphold.\"",
      "In the complaint, the Black Navy SEAL said his name was scratched off two plaques where it once appeared alongside others serving on SEAL Team Four. On one of the plaques, the names are etched into a piece of wood under a hatchet adorned with Navy SEAL Tridents, the physical pin that signifies a SEAL.",
      "The SEAL described the removal of his name as \"A final, disgraceful act to make it clear that I was not welcome,\" and that it was \"a direct and unmistakable act of hatred.\"",
      "Overall, the SEAL wrote of others' behavior, \"these were men who were supposed to be my brothers, but instead, they either participated in or enabled a culture of bigotry and silence.\"",
      "SEAL Team Four is based out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek in Virginia and falls under Naval Special Warfare Group Two, which oversees Team Four and three other SEAL Teams.",
      "Each SEAL Team can have roughly 250 service members, including Navy SEALs and combat support personnel, according to the command climate surveys obtained by CBS News and former Navy SEALs.",
      "The Black Navy SEAL, who declined to be interviewed, was in Delta platoon, a unit of roughly 16 to 20 SEALs. Prior to becoming a SEAL, he had earned a degree in global studies and was a trained pilot, according to the documents.",
      "He filed the harassment complaints after his Trident, the physical pin that signifies a SEAL, was revoked after review boards found his performance was lacking. But records obtained by CBS News show he was a qualified sniper and a certified joint terminal attack controller or JTAC for short. JTACs fill a high-stress role \u2013 it requires extreme precision, since the controllers coordinate aircraft delivering bombs and missiles, sometimes near their position on the ground. A mistake can be deadly.",
      "Brown, in refuting the SEAL's substandard performance review, pointed out that SEAL leaders typically send their smartest service members to sniper and JTAC school.",
      "After an investigation, the SEAL's Trident was restored. Brown believes he's the first Navy SEAL in history whose Trident was restored after it was revoked. The board that carried out the SEAL's review will undergo reforms, Brown told CBS News.",
      "Moreover, Brown said Rear Adm. Sands also called the SEAL to thank him for his service and extended his Navy tenure to enable him to get military medical treatment and moved him to a command that is closer to his family. The SEAL has since left the Navy.",
      "A Naval Special Warfare spokesperson said the Navy had \"completed accountability\" regarding the SEAL's case.",
      "\"Individuals accepted responsibility for their actions, reinforcing NSW's commitment to accountability, transparency, and upholding the standard of the quiet professional,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The SEAL's superiors did not enable the chat content, according to the spokesperson, but they were counseled in front of their peers because the incident had occurred under their command. Brown, the SEAL's attorney, said those counseled included the commanding officer, executive officer and command master chief of SEAL Team Four.",
      "Brown told CBS News that he had previously served with the commanding officer of SEAL Team Four.",
      "\"He is not a racist man but he made a misjudgment in this case,\" Brown told CBS News. \"They will never command forces in NSW again.\"",
      "The leadership also held all-hands calls at various levels to address the misconduct within the group chat directly with the force, according to the spokesperson.",
      "Some of the misconduct in the chat stemmed from \"meme drop(s)\" the members had periodically on Fridays \"to make fun of things that happened each week,\" according to one individual whom investigators found had contributed to a hostile environment because he did not stop the messages. Four of the six memes investigated were sent on a Friday, according to the investigation.",
      "The investigated messages included one that read, \"I dropped a hard R in front of a black student 3 weeks ago.\" The author had a \"pattern of behavior\" using the word \"n*****,\" investigators found.",
      "In the course of their review, military investigators also discovered some team members had referred to a fellow service member as \"dragon lady\" and mocked her Asian accent.",
      "When asked by CBS News if there is any mandated racial sensitivity training, the spokesperson said there was not, adding that the command is committed to accountability. The investigations helped \"identify shortcomings and implement corrective measures.\"",
      "CBS News obtained Defense Organizational Climate Surveys for SEAL Team Four through the Freedom of Information Act for the years 2018, 2022, 2023 and 2024. These surveys provide commanders with both statistical details and comments from their service members on a wide array of issues within their units.",
      "Troops are not required to fill them out, and the responses are anonymous. But all Defense Department units are required to take them annually or whenever a new officer takes over a command of more than 50 people.",
      "SEAL teams generally have limited numbers of troops representing racial and ethnic minorities. Nonetheless, the records obtained by CBS News show that service members have persistently reported racially harassing behavior. In 2024 for instance, 5 out of the 105 members of SEAL Team Four who took the survey reported it.",
      "The figures were higher in 2022 when 18 out of the 105 members of SEAL Team Four reported experiencing racially harassing behaviors. The Team took two surveys in 2023 showing fluctuating but similar results.",
      "Between 2022 and 2024, SEAL Team Four commanders writing to their direct superior underscored that they believe \"diversity is key to organizational growth,\" and that they \"highly encourage inclusion of all personnel, regardless of ethnicity, background, rate, or otherwise.\"",
      "In a Nov. 2023 letter, Cmdr. Bryan Jennings, the commander of Navy SEAL TEAM Four at the time, wrote: \"Racial and sexual harassing behaviors were 6%-7% negative, which is an overall low number, but any percentage in these categories is a weakness that should be addressed.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A walkway in the White House's West Wing that President Trump has dubbed the \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" now features partisan plaques installed under the portraits of his predecessors.",
      "From \"Sleepy Joe\" Biden references to painting Republican icon Ronald Reagan as a fan of a young Mr. Trump, the plaques include language written in Trumpian style. The installation is the president's latest move to shape the White House in his image, an effort that has spanned from adding gilded decor in the Oval Office to razing the East Wing in preparation for a massive ballroom addition.",
      "An introductory plaque tells passersby that the Presidential Walk of Fame was \"conceived, built, and dedicated by President Donald J. Trump as a tribute to past Presidents, good, bad, and somewhere in the middle.\"",
      "Biden's plaque repeats a false claim that the 46th president, a Democrat, took office \"as a result of the most corrupt election ever,\" when, in fact, he defeated Mr. Trump in 2020 in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Biden is also described as \"by far, the worst president in American history.\"",
      "Another Democrat, Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president and Mr. Trump's first presidential predecessor, is labeled \"one of the most divisive political figures in American history.\"",
      "The plaque below former President George W. Bush's portrait appears to approve of the Republican's creation of the Department of Homeland Security but decries that he \"started wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which should not have happened.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the texts are \"eloquently written descriptions of each president\" and that \"many were written directly by the president himself.\"",
      "Biden had no comment on his plaque. There were no immediate responses to emails sent to aides for Obama and several other former presidents.",
      "Mr. Trump in September refashioned the colonnade that runs from the West Wing to the White House residence with gilded portraits of all former presidents, except for Biden. For him, Mr. Trump instead chose a picture of an\u00a0autopen, reflecting his contention that Biden was not up to the job.",
      "The walkway is the president's usual entrance to the Oval Office, meaning Mr. Trump can easily take his guests \u2014 foreign dignitaries included \u2014 past the exhibit with his framing of his predecessors.",

      "As Mr. Trump makes his mark on the White House grounds, the Trump administration is facing a lawsuit\u00a0from the National Trust for Historic Preservation over the demolition of the East Wing and plans for the new ballroom. The Trump administration insists it didn't need approvals for the demolition.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon on Tuesday denied a motion by the preservation group that would have temporarily blocked construction\u00a0of the new ballroom, but he set out some requirements for the Trump administration moving forward.",
      "The president also undertook a major overhaul of the South Lawn, paving over a former grassy area with concrete to easier facilitate tables and chairs.",

      "Isaacman, a 42-year-old businessman, made his fortune in online payment processing and has a personal passion for space. He paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount in February 2021 to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight \u2014 the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission. He flew again in September 2024 on the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight.",

      "\"America will return to the moon before our great rival, and we will establish an enduring presence to understand and realize the scientific, economic and national security value on the lunar surface,\" Isaacman said.",

    "summary": "The Senate approved a $900 billion defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act, sending it to the president's desk for his signature.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate approved a $900 billion defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act on Wednesday, sending it to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "The measure cleared the upper chamber with broad bipartisan support in a vote of 77 to 20.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, praised the bill's bipartisan tradition ahead of the vote Wednesday.",
      "\"This will be the 65th year in a row, the 65th consecutive year that Congress has come together across the aisle and across two chambers to send the president a bill designed to sustain and strengthen the national defense,\" Wicker said. \"Everyone in this Senate played a role.\"",
      "The NDAA is an annual must-pass piece of legislation that sets lawmakers' defense priorities. This year's version, which is more than 3,000 pages long, aims to codify more than a dozen of President Trump's executive orders, including prohibiting diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the Defense Department, authorizing the use of active-duty troops along the U.S.-Mexico border and deploying a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense shield.",
      "The bill includes a 3.8% pay raise for all service members. It also includes language that prohibits transgender women from participating in women's athletic programs or activities at military service academies.",
      "The House approved the massive defense policy legislation last week in a 312 to 112 vote. House Speaker Mike Johnson struggled to hold his conference together for a procedural vote, facing pushback from conservatives.",
      "Some of the pushback came from the inclusion of aid for Ukraine. The bill authorizes $400 million for military assistance in both fiscal years 2026 and 2027.",
      "The bill would also roll back the legal justifications used to attack Iraq in 1991 and 2003, along with repealing sanctions on Syria under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019. It includes provisions that limit the administration's ability to reduce troop levels in Europe, and withholds part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's travel budget until the Pentagon hands over footage of the strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela.",
      "Since the House approved the bill, some lawmakers have expressed concerns that it doesn't do enough to restrict military aircraft near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Last week, National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy warned that a provision in the NDAA \"does not in any way enhance safety\" and \"reverses safety changes\" made after a midair collision in January between a military helicopter and a passenger jet that killed 67 people. The bill, Homendy said, \"essentially gives the military unfettered access to the crowded and complex D.C. airspace.\"",
      "Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Maria Cantwell of Washington, the chair and ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee, have been pursuing a fix. The panel advanced a measure earlier this year known as the ROTOR Act, which would tighten the rules in D.C. airspace. Later Wednesday, Cruz successfully passed the measure under unanimous consent.",
      "The Texas Republican said he, Cantwell and Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas had made \"significant progress\" and had reached an agreement to pass the bill unanimously. He also noted that the White House backs the bill and \"is committed to helping us work with our House colleagues to see that the ROTOR Act passes in that chamber.\"",
      "\"We still have a few small, outstanding issues, but I'm optimistic that we're going to get this done and signed into law as soon as next month,\" Cruz said.",

    "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said Ray Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, will donate to the Trump accounts initiative.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday unveiled the new website for the Trump Accounts program, a tax-deferred investment vehicle for American children. He also announced a new Trump Accounts partner, billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio.",
      "At a briefing on the program, Bessent projected that the $1,000 deposited into a Trump Account by the government when a child is born would grow to over $600,000 by retirement age, assuming that the historic growth rate continues. For families who invest $5,000 each year in the accounts, that sum would grow to $1 million, he added.",
      "Parents may sign up their children by making an election on a new IRS form \u2014 Form 4547 \u2014 when they file their taxes. A financial institution will receive the child's funds and activate the account. Trump accounts are to be invested in an authorized investment, like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028 are eligible to receive the $1,000 government contribution into their accounts. Children under 18 who have a Social Security number can receive up to $5,000 each year from parents, guardians or others in their account.",
      "Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, is contributing $75 million as part of a 50-state push for businesses and philanthropic organizations to donate in each state. Dalio will \"boost funding for Trump accounts for kids across Connecticut,\" Bessent said.",
      "\"Ray and Barbara Dalio through Dalio Philanthropies announced today that they are joining the Dell family in seeding the new Trump Administration investment accounts with an additional $250 per child for approximately 300,000 children in Connecticut,\" the Dalios said in a statement on their foundation's website.",
      "The accounts were created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill earlier this year. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for the one-time $1,000 government contribution.",
      "Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell donated a historic $6.25 billion earlier this month, pledging to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million children ages 10 and younger as an incentive to save for the future.",
      "Families will be able to start making financial contributions on July 5, 2026. They won't be able to withdraw funds from the Trump account before a child turns 18, except under certain conditions.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department is suing more than a dozen landlords on allegations of sexual harassment, a problem one top department official called \"traumatic for the victims\" and \"inappropriate and illegal.\"",
    "story": [
      "In a crowded neighborhood of duplexes, small apartments and one-story bungalows near a liquor store and pizza shop, William Asper serves as a landlord for nearly two dozen properties.",
      "The Detroit suburb of Westland, Michigan, 10 minutes north of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, is where Asper helps manage some weathered rental properties, many of which were built in the early 1970s and are more affordable to low-income families in this working-class region, according to federal records published by the Justice Department.",
      "Amid surging housing costs, rent in the neighborhood is more affordable, including for families who use federal subsidies and have no other options for housing.",
      "The Justice Department has alleged Asper tried to take advantage of the needs of his tenants, leveraging his position to seek sexual favors. The agency said Asper threatened to withhold repairs or evict tenants who did not comply.",
      "In a court filing in Michigan earlier this month, the Justice Department alleged Asper told one tenant in 2019 \"that there were 'different ways' she could pay rent.\" The government's attorneys also said he \"touched the tenant without her consent, regularly pulling her hair, grabbing her buttocks and kissing her head.\" And they alleged he \"regularly pulled his penis out of his pants in front of the tenant while at her home, often times while her young son was in the room.\"",
      "In their court documents, Justice Department lawyers also alleged that in 2018, Asper told a \"female tenant that he was lonely, wanted someone to spend time with him, and asked if she would go to a hotel with him. Asper allegedly \"told the female tenant that if she did not engage in sexual relations with him, he would give her a 24-hour eviction notice.\"",
      "The allegations appeared in a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Asper, arguing he violated the federal Fair Housing Act. His civil case is pending in the Eastern District of Michigan federal court, and his formal response to the allegations has not yet been posted.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Asper said the accusations are false.",
      "\"I offer low-income housing and people want to blame the landlord or make excuses why they couldn't pay the rent,\" Asper said. \"These women wanted to do more/be my 'girlfriend', side chick and that was not going to happen.\"",
      "Asper isn't the only landlord facing such claims. It is one of at least 52 federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and misconduct against landlords since 2017.",
      "\"It's traumatic for the victims,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. \"People may not believe them. And they may have been the victim multiple times.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which seeks to combat these types of cases, was launched in the first year of the first Trump administration in 2017. Dhillon's team continues to pursue the cases. Several former Justice Department attorneys, including appointees of both the Biden and Trump Administrations, have lauded the program and its work since 2017.",
      "There are 14 federal sexual harassment civil cases pending across the United States, including Asper's case in Michigan.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Dhillon said the filings of these suits can serve as a deterrent to future harassment and abuse. She said the legal challenges \"made all the women in that property feel like they've been seen and heard.\"",
      "Dhillon said the Fair Housing Act, which passed in 1968 amid the sweeping changes of the Civil Rights era, prohibits any kind of quid pro quo involving sex, sexual acts or sexual harassment, either for renting, continuing to rent or obtaining repairs.",
      "\"Every American deserves to feel safe and know this sexual harassment is inappropriate and illegal,\" Dhillon said.",
      "A CBS News review of some of the dozens of recently filed Justice Department cases shows parallels to the accusations against Asper.",
      "In a separate legal challenge filed against a central New York landlord in 2018, the Justice Department alleged the harassment spanned three decades. The Oswego man is accused of \"Demanding that female tenants engage in, or pressuring them to engage in, sexual intercourse, oral sex, or other sexual acts with him in order to obtain or keep rental housing.\"",
      "In a 2017 Justice Department complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, a Wichita-area landlord is accused of entering a female tenant's apartment \"unannounced\" and \"touching her body while she slept in her bed.\" The landlord is also accused of \"Conditioning tangible housing benefits, including forgiving or reducing rent, on engaging in sexual conduct.\"",
      "And in a legal challenge initially filed in Minnesota in 2020, the feds alleged a landlord offered to overlook or excuse unpaid rent and utilities in exchange for sex acts. The landlord was also accused of \"Expressing a preference for renting to single female tenants.\"",
      "The legal challenges filed by the Justice Department can help secure civil penalties against landlords and damages for victims. A CBS News review of Justice Department records showed the agency has recovered approximately $1.5 million since January.",
      "And in the New York, Kansas and Minnesota cases, the Justice Department struck written agreements with the landlords that, among other things, required them to hire independent property managers so they would no longer need to come into contact with tenants themselves.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Fair Housing Alliance, a civil rights group that advocates for tenants and combats discrimination, said instances of sexual harassment by landlords are likely more pervasive than current statistics indicate.",
      "\"Sexual harassment in housing is one of the most underreported instances of housing discrimination, given that the victims often fear facing retaliation or eviction if they file a complaint,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which handles Fair Housing Act sex harassment probes, has experienced a purge of veteran employees this year, amid a Trump-ordered downsizing of the federal government \u2014 led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 and the Trump Administration's dramatic shifts in some of the office's priorities.",
      "Justice Connection, a newly formed organization that supports ousted or resigning Justice Department prosecutors, estimated nearly 75% of career attorneys in the division have departed this year.",
      "Dhillon said the unit that handles the housing cases has been less impacted by the changes and cuts. She told CBS News, \"I don't think we're losing people in that section, and people are pretty happy with the type of work we're doing.\" Dhillon said the Civil Rights section has hired approximately 50 people this year, amid the larger turnover in the agency.",
      "Some tenants have filed their own individual federal civil lawsuits alleging sex harassment in violation of the Fair Housing Act.",
      "In one case, an Alabama woman filed a complaint in federal court alleging a series of personal harms. Her suit alleged \"emotional distress, including humiliation and mental anguish\" from a landlord who \"offered to reduce her rent in exchange for sex.\" The lawsuit alleged: \"When [she] refused his sexual advances, he raised her rent.\"",
      "Housing advocates said low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to harassment, under fear that they could lose their housing if they reject a landlord's unlawful advances.",
      "The Justice Department's posted guidance on its protections of the Fair Housing Act says that \"women, particularly those who are poor, and with limited housing options, often have little recourse but to tolerate the humiliation and degradation of sexual harassment or risk having their families and themselves removed from their homes. The Department's enforcement program is aimed at landlords who create an untenable living environment by demanding sexual favors from tenants or by creating a sexually hostile environment for them.\"",
      "The National Fair Housing Alliance spokesperson told CBS News: \"Each investigation\u2014and especially every resolution\u2014sends a clear message that this egregious conduct, which targets the most vulnerable, will not be tolerated. Home should be a safe place, and these actions ensure that promise is upheld.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on a violent Mexican fuel-theft cartel and its imprisoned leader, amid the Trump administration's crackdown on cartels backing operations through stolen oil and gas.",
      "The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated the Guanajuato-based group known as the \"Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima,\" or CSRL, after U.S. officials found the enterprise turned a profit by stealing fuel and crude oil from Mexico's state-owned energy company, Pemex.",
      "OFAC also sanctioned Jose Antonio Yepez Ortiz. Dubbed \"El Marro,\" or \"the sledgehammer,\" the leader of CSRL is currently serving out a 60-year sentence in Mexico, but U.S. officials have accused him of orchestrating cartel operations from behind bars by \"sending instructions and orders to his collaborators through his lawyers and family members.\"",
      "Fuel theft \u2014 more commonly known as huachicol in Mexico \u2014 has risen to the second most profitable revenue stream for Mexican cartels behind drug trafficking, according to the U.S. Treasury. U.S. officials allege that members of CSRL steal fuel and crude oil from Pemex by bribing insiders, tapping pipelines, siphoning refineries, hijacking tanker trucks, and intimidating employees.",
      "The stolen fuel is then sold across Mexico, the United States and Central America, while crude oil is smuggled north via complicit brokers \u2014 frequently disguised as \"waste oil\" to evade taxes and environmental scrutiny, the U.S. Treasury discovered. Once inside the United States, the oil is then funneled to unscrupulous importers along the southwest border, sold at deep discounts on U.S. and global markets with proceeds quietly funneled back to the cartels \u2014 fueling corruption, violence and a sprawling cross-border energy black market.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday's action is part of President Trump's pledge to \"eliminate\" cartels by cutting them off from the U.S. financial system, regardless of how they generate or launder money.",
      "CSRL, founded around 2014 and named after a community within Guanajuato, has been locked in a bloody turf war with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) since 2017 over control of fuel theft in a pipeline-dense region known as the \"Bermuda Triangle.\" The Treasury says that conflict has helped make Guanajuato one of Mexico's deadliest states. As recently as August, Mexican authorities seized more than 164,000 liters of stolen hydrocarbons linked to the group.",
      "U.S. officials say CSRL has allied with the Gulf Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel and has recruited former Colombian military and paramilitary members. The group is also accused of trafficking narcotics \u2014 including heroin \u2014 into the United States.",
      "Tuesday's sanctions freeze any U.S.-based assets belonging to CSRL and Yepez Ortiz, formally barring Americans from doing business with them and imposing possible civil or criminal penalties against violators.",
      "The decision follows earlier steps by the Trump administration to designate CJNG as a foreign terrorist organization and target affiliated fuel-theft networks tied to the criminal enterprise.",
      "After a May alert from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury says banks reported more than $827 million in suspicious oil-smuggling transactions underscoring the scope of the black market. According to FinCEN's analysis \u2014 and removing outliers \u2014 the average oil smuggling transaction is priced at $5 million, with suspicious activity reports frequently filed in Florida and Texas, including towns near the U.S.-Mexico border like Brownsville, Mission and Eagle Pass.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Columbia Memorial Hospital near Oregon's coastline is forging ahead with emergency plans in case of a major earthquake or tsunami.",
    "story": [
      "ASTORIA, Ore. \u2014 Residents of this small coastal city in the Pacific Northwest know what to do when there's a tsunami warning: Flee to higher ground.",
      "For those in or near Columbia Memorial, the city's only hospital, there will soon be a different plan: Shelter in place. The hospital is building a new facility next door with an on-site tsunami shelter \u2014 an elevated refuge atop columns deeply anchored in the ground, where nearly 2,000 people can safely wait out a flood.",
      "Oregon needs more shelters like the one that Columbia Memorial is building, emergency managers say. Hospitals in the region are likely to incur serious damage, if not ruin, and could take more than three years to fully recover in the event of a major earthquake and tsunami, according to a state report.",
      "Columbia Memorial's current facility is a single-story building, made of wood a half-century ago, that would likely collapse and sink into the ground or be swallowed by a landslide after a major earthquake or a tsunami, said Erik Thorsen, the hospital's chief executive.",
      "\"It is just not built to survive either one of those natural disaster events,\" Thorsen said.",
      "At least 10 other hospitals along the Oregon coast are in danger as well. So Columbia Memorial leaders proposed building a hospital capable of withstanding an earthquake and landslide, with a tsunami shelter, instead of relocating the facility to higher ground. Residents and state officials supported the plans, and the federal government awarded a $14 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help pay for the tsunami shelter.",
      "The project broke ground in October 2024. Within six months, the Trump administration had canceled\u00a0the grant program, known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, calling it \"yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program \u2026 more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.\"",
      "Molly Wing, director of the expansion project, said losing the BRIC grant felt like \"a punch to the gut.\"",
      "\"We really didn't see that coming,\" she said.",
      "This summer, Oregon and 19 other states sued to restore the FEMA grants. On Dec. 11, a judge ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully ended the program without congressional approval.",
      "The administration did not immediately indicate it would appeal the decision, but Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said by email: \"DHS has not terminated BRIC. Any suggestion to the contrary is a lie. The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund. It's unfortunate that an activist judge either didn't understand that or didn't care.\" FEMA is a subdivision of DHS.",
      "Columbia Memorial was one of the few hospitals slated to receive grants from the BRIC program, which had announced more than $4.5 billion for nearly 2,000 building projects since 2022.",
      "Hospital leaders have decided to keep building \u2014 with uncertain funding \u2014 because they say waiting is too dangerous. With the Trump administration reversing course on BRIC, fewer communities will receive help from FEMA to reduce their disaster risk, even places where catastrophes are likely.",
      "More than three centuries have passed since a major earthquake caused the Pacific Northwest's coastline to drop several feet and unleashed a tsunami that crashed onto the land in January 1700, according to scientists who study the evolution of the Oregon coast.",
      "The greatest danger is an underwater fault line known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which lies 70 to 100 miles off the coast, from Northern California to British Columbia.",
      "The Cascadia zone can produce a megathrust earthquake, with a magnitude of 9 or higher \u2014 the type capable of triggering a catastrophic tsunami \u2014 every 500 years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Scientists predict a 10% to 15% chance of such an earthquake along the fault zone in the next 50 years.",
      "\"We can't wait any longer,\" Thorsen said. \"The risk is high.\"",
      "Building for the future",
      "The BRIC program started in 2020, during the first Trump administration, to provide communities and institutions with funding and technical assistance to fortify their structures against natural disasters.",
      "Joel Scata, a senior attorney with the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, said the program helped communities better prepare so they could reduce the cost of rebuilding after a flood, tornado, wildfire, or extreme weather event.",
      "To qualify for a grant, a hospital had to show that the project's benefits were greater than the future danger and cost. In some cases, that benefit might not be readily apparent.",
      "\"It prevents bad disasters from happening, and so you don't necessarily see it in action,\" Scata said.",
      "Scata noted that the Trump administration has also stopped awarding grants through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which predates BRIC.",
      "\"There really is no money going out the door from the federal government to help communities reduce their disaster risk,\" he said.",
      "A recent KFF Health News investigation using proprietary data from Fathom, a global leader in flood modeling, found that at least 170 U.S. hospitals are at risk of significant and potentially dangerous flooding from more intense and frequent storms. That count did not include Columbia Memorial, as Fathom's data did not account for tsunamis. It models flooding from rivers, sea level rise, and extreme rainfall.",
      "In recent days, an atmospheric river \u2014 a narrow storm band carrying significant amounts of moisture \u2014 dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Oregon and Washington, causing catastrophic flooding along rivers and the coast. In the Washington town of Sedro-Woolley, which sits along the Skagit River, the PeaceHealth United General Medical Center evacuated nonemergency patients.",
      "High winds battered Astoria, leaving the city with some minor landslides, according to news reports. But flooding on the road to the nearby beach town of Seaside made the drive nearly impassable.",
      "The Trump administration is leaning on states to take greater responsibility for recovering from natural disasters, Scata said, but most states are not financially prepared to do so.",
      "\"The disasters are just going to keep on piling up,\" he said, \"and the federal government's going to have to keep stepping in.\"",
      "A hospital at risk",
      "Columbia Memorial is blocks from the southern shore of the Columbia River, near the Washington border, where the area's natural hazards include earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, and floods. A critical access hospital with 25 beds, it opened in 1977 \u2014 before state building codes addressed tsunami protections.",
      "Thorsen said the new facility and shelter would be a \"model design\" for other hospitals. Design plans show a five-level hospital built atop a foundation anchored to the bedrock and surrounded by concrete columns to shield it from tsunami debris.",
      "The shelter will be on the roof of the second floor, above the projected maximum tsunami inundation. It will be accessible via an outdoor staircase and interior staircases and elevators, with enough room for up to 1,900 people, plus food, water, tents, and other supplies to sustain them for five days.",
      "With most patient care provided on the second and third levels, generators on the fourth level, and utility lines underground, the hospital is expected to remain operational after a natural disaster.",
      "Thorsen said an earthquake and tsunami threaten not only vast flooding but also liquefaction, in which the ground loosens and causes structures above it to collapse. Deep foundations, thick slabs, and other structural supports are expected to protect the new hospital and tsunami structure against such failure.",
      "Through the years, hospital administrators and civic leaders in Astoria have sought other locations for Columbia Memorial. But relocation wasn't economical. Columbia Memorial committed to invest in a new hospital and tsunami shelter to protect not only patients and staff but also nearby residents.",
      "\"Your community should count on your hospital to be a safe haven in a natural disaster,\" Thorsen said.",
      "Fighting to restore funds",
      "The estimated construction budget for Columbia Memorial's expansion is $300 million, mostly financed through new debt from the hospital. The tsunami shelter is budgeted at about $20 million, for which FEMA's BRIC program awarded nearly $14 million, with a $6 million matching grant from the state, which has maintained its support.",
      "The shelter and the building's structural protections \u2014 featuring reinforced steel, deeper foundations, and thicker slabs \u2014 are integral to the design and cannot be removed without compromising the rest of the structure, said Michelle Checkis, the project architect.",
      "\"We can't pull the TVERS [tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structure] out without pulling the hospital back apart again,\" she said. \"It's kind of like, if I was going to stack it up with Legos, I would have to take all those Legos apart and stack it up completely differently.\"",
      "Columbia Memorial has sought help from Oregon's congressional delegation. In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and former FEMA acting administrator David Richardson, the lawmakers demanded that the agencies restore the hospital's grant.",
      "The hospital's leadership is seeking other grants and philanthropic donations to make up for the loss. As a last resort, Thorsen said, the board will consider removing \"nonessential features\" from the building, though he added that there is little fat to trim from the project.",
      "The lawsuit brought by states in July alleged that FEMA lacks the authority to cancel the BRIC program or redirect its funding for other purposes.",
      "The states argued that canceling the program ran counter to Congress' intent and undermined projects underway.",
      "In their response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration said repeatedly that the defendants \"deny that the BRIC program has been terminated.\"",
      "The lawsuit cites examples of projects at risk in each state due to FEMA's termination of the grants. Oregon's first example is Columbia Memorial's tsunami shelter. \"Neither the County nor the State can afford to resume the project without federal funding,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "In response to questions about the impact of canceling the grant on Astoria and the surrounding community, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said BRIC had \"deviated from its statutory intent.\"",
      "\"BRIC was more focused on climate change initiatives like bicycle lanes, shaded bus stops, and planting trees, rather than disaster relief or mitigation,\" McLaughlin said. DHS and FEMA provided no further comment about BRIC or the Astoria hospital.",
      "Preparing for a tsunami disaster",
      "Located near the end of the Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail, Astoria sits on a peninsula that juts into the Columbia River near the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Much of the city is not in the tsunami inundation area. But Astoria's downtown commercial district \u2014 where gift shops, hotels, and seafood restaurants line the streets \u2014 is nearly all an evacuation zone.",
      "Two hospitals \u2014 Ocean Beach Health in nearby Washington, and Providence Seaside Hospital in Oregon \u2014 are about 20 miles from Columbia Memorial. Both are 25-bed hospitals, and neither is designed to withstand a tsunami.",
      "Ocean Beach Health regularly conducts drills for mass-casualty and natural disasters, said Brenda Sharkey, its chief nursing officer.",
      "\"We focus our planning and investments on areas where we can make a real difference for our community before, during, and after an event \u2014 such as maintaining continuity of care, ensuring rapid triage, and coordinating with regional emergency partners,\" Sharkey said in an email.",
      "Gary Walker, a spokesperson for Providence Seaside, said in a statement that the hospital has a \"comprehensive emergency plan for earthquakes and tsunamis, including alternative sites and mobile resources.\"",
      "Walker added that Providence Seaside has hired \"a team of consultants and experts to conduct a conceptual resilience study\" that would evaluate the hospital's vulnerabilities and recommend ways to address them.",
      "Oregon's emergency managers advise residents and visitors in coastal communities to immediately seek higher ground after a major earthquake \u2014 and not to rely on tsunami sirens, social media, or most technology.",
      "\"There may not even be cellphone towers operating after an event like this,\" said Jonathan Allan, a coastal geomorphologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. \"The earthquake shaking, its intensity, and particularly the length of time in which the shaking persists, is the warning message.\"",
      "The stronger the earthquake and the longer the shaking, he said, the more likely a tsunami will head to shore.",
      "A tsunami triggered by a Cascadia zone earthquake could strike land in less than 30 minutes, according to state estimates.",
      "Many of Oregon's seaside communities are near high-enough ground to seek safety from a tsunami in a relatively short time, Allan said. But he estimated that, to save lives, Oregon would need about a dozen vertical tsunami evacuation shelters along the coast, including in seaside towns that attract tourists and where the nearest high ground is a mile or more away.",
      "Willis Van Dusen's family has lived in Astoria since the mid-19th century. A former mayor of Astoria, Van Dusen stressed that tsunamis are not a hypothetical danger. He recalled seeing one in Seaside in 1964. The wave was only about 18 inches high, he said, but it flooded a road and destroyed a bridge and some homes. The memory has stayed with him.",
      "\"It's not like \u2026 'Oh, that'll never happen,'\" he said. \"We have to be prepared for it.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday more than doubled the list of countries subject to his travel ban or to heavy restrictions, bringing the total number of nations affected by the sweeping set of immigration and entry limits to 39.",
      "The first iteration of the\u00a0travel ban Mr. Trump issued in June included 19 countries, fully barring the entry of immigrants and travelers from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "The proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on Tuesday added seven countries to the list of states facing full entry restrictions: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Laos, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Syria. It imposed partial entry limits on immigrants and travelers from another 15 countries, including Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation also enacted an entry ban for those traveling with documents issued by the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank. The restrictions on travelers from Turkmenistan were eased, after Mr. Trump said that country had improved its information-sharing with the U.S.",
      "The immigration and travel restrictions include some exceptions, including for permanent U.S. residents from the countries on the list and athletes and staff participating in major sporting events like the FIFA World Cup next year. But Tuesday's proclamation also eliminated an exception, included in the June travel ban, that exempted the children, spouses and parents of U.S. citizens who had requested visas on their behalf.",
      "CBS News had reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was considering expanding its travel ban following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Thanksgiving week. The suspect in that attack, which killed one of the soldiers, is an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025.",
      "In his decree on Tuesday, Mr. Trump cited multiple reasons to justify the travel ban's expansion, including concerns about the ability to adequately vet immigrants from the impacted countries and the lack of reliable record-keeping and information-sharing in some of those nations. He also referenced armed conflict, corruption, fraud and terrorism in certain countries on the list.",
      "Mr. Trump said Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica also offer citizenship to foreigners without a residency requirement, creating the risk that someone from the countries subject to the travel ban could seek to gain status in those Caribbean nations to bypass the U.S. entry restrictions.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, versions of his travel ban faced significant public backlash and legal challenges that alleged the policy was discriminatory in nature. In 2018, however, the Supreme Court upheld the president's power to suspend the entry of foreigners on national security grounds through a legal authority known as 212(f).",

    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

He paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount in February 2021 to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight \u2014 the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission.

    "summary": "Super-Earth TOI-561b is about 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the sun.",
    "story": [
      "A rocky exoplanet outside the Earth's solar system may have an atmosphere, according to new evidence gathered by NASA researchers.",
      "The exoplanet, known as super-Earth TOI-561b, was discovered in 2020, according to NASA. Scientists have determined that the planet is ultra-hot, with a low density. It is about 1.4 times wider than Earth and orbits the sun in about 11 hours. Its host star is similar to Earth's sun in size and temperature, but the exoplanet is 40 times closer to that star than Mercury is to the sun, NASA said in a news release. Observations suggest the exoplanet has a global magma ocean and that it is surrounded by a thick layer of gas.",
      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has named Bishop Ronald Hicks of Joliet, Illinois, to succeed retiring Timothy Cardinal Dolan as archbishop of New York.",
      "The Vatican said Thursday morning that Pope Leo had officially accepted Dolan's resignation.",
      "Dolan was named Archbishop of New York by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009 and led the archdiocese for 16 years.",
      "About Bishop Hicks",
      "Pope Leo is from Illinois, and he has tapped a fellow Illinois native to lead the archdiocese of New York.",
      "Hicks, 58, and Pope Leo have much in common. They were both born and raised in suburban Chicago, with Hicks being born in Harvey and raised in South Holland. Both men also speak fluent Spanish after spending years ministering to the poor in South America and Central America.",
      "Hicks graduated from seminary in 1985 and went on to study philosophy at Loyola University Chicago before getting his master's degree in divinity at the University of St. Mary of the Lake. He was ordained in 1994.",
      "In 2005, Hicks moved from Chicago to El Salvador, where he served for five years as regional director of an organization dedicated to caring for thousands of orphaned and abandoned children.",
      "In 2020, Hicks was named as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Joliet, Illinois.",
      "Cardinal Dolan submitted his resignation earlier this year",
      "Dolan turned 75 in February, and was required to submit his resignation to the Vatican. At the time, Dolan estimated he would remain in his post for about six to eight months while the Holy See appointed his successor.",
      "Popes sometimes allow bishops to remain in their post for months or even years after they submit their resignation. By replacing Dolan before his 76th birthday, Pope Leo is exercising his prerogative to shape the leadership of a key archdiocese with his preferred candidate.",
      "Dolan has served as archbishop of New York since 2009,\u00a0leading approximately 2.8 million Catholics. For the last 16 years, Cardinal Dolan has been a prominent, charismatic figure and a leading voice for Catholicism in the United States. He led the Archdiocese through the COVID pandemic and numerous difficult decisions, including selling assets to fund a settlement for victims of priest sex abuse, closure of many Catholic schools, and realignment of parishes which resulted in the closure of some churches.",
      "Cardinal Dolan lauded by leader of Catholic League",
      "Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said Dolan has been a compassionate defender of church teaching and a warmhearted leader, adding he wished the Pope would keep Dolan in the role a little longer.",
      "\"To fill the shoes of Cardinal Dolan, good luck to the new archbishop of New York,\" Donohue said. \"Cardinal Dolan ... is certainly loved by New Yorkers, and I don't mean just by Catholics. I mean by non-Catholics as well. He's one of the most courageous and honest priests I've ever met in my life.\"",
      "Dolan has said, once his resignation is accepted, he'll continue to serve the church as part of his vow of obedience.",
      "\"I find obedience liberating. People say, 'What are you going to do?' I don't really know. It ain't my decision. You just say, 'Jesus, I trust in thee. And, Holy Father, I trust in you,'\" Dolan said at the time.",
      "After he retires, Dolan will remain a Cardinal and can vote in a conclave until he turns 80.",
      "New Yorkers react to Cardinal Dolan's departure",
      "Parishioners in New York City reacted Wednesday night to the idea of a future without Dolan as Archbishop of New York.",
      "\"When he gives a sermon, you feel like he's speaking to you personally,\" Brooklyn resident Theresa Start said. \"He's wonderful. I'll miss him.\"",
      "\"I think he's a great guy, and he's down to earth, very friendly,\" tourist Bill Moran said.",
      "\"We love him, and we wish him the best,\" Staten Island resident Don Goller said.",
      "\"I'm looking forward toward a new chapter,\" Bronx resident Lana German said.",
      "\"Maybe get some fresh ideas and another person in that will hopefully bring people together,\" Upper Manhattan resident Migdalia Quinones said.",
      "Meanwhile, attorneys representing more than 75 alleged child sex abuse survivors who filed claims against the Archdiocese released a statement, saying, in part:",
      "\"Cardinal Dolan's resignation will not stop our pursuit of answers and requests to depose him, nor will we allow a game of diocesan musical chairs to stand in the way of justice for survivors. True accountability requires disclosure, cooperation, and justice, not a quiet exit and attempts to pass the buck to the next Cardinal. As this chapter closes on the Archdiocese of New York, we call on the next Cardinal to abandon the ADNY's campaign of secrecy and work with survivors to ensure they receive justice for the crimes committed against them and that this appalling abuse never happens again.\"",

    "summary": "The White House says encampment sweeps have enhanced the capital, but city leaders estimate nearly 700 homeless people roam by day and bed down outdoors by night.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Every night, Abdullah Ibrahim retreats from the streets into a wooded stretch along the Potomac River.",
      "As night falls and temperatures drop, he erects a tent and builds a fire beneath a canopy of pine, hemlock, and cedar trees.",
      "He evades authorities by rotating use of three tents of different colors at three campsites. As day breaks, he dismantles his shelter, rolls up his belongings, and hides them for the next night. \"They don't see you if you're in the woods,\" the 32-year-old said. \"But make sure it's broken down by morning or they'll find you.\"",
      "During the day, he wanders, stopping at a public library to warm up or a soup kitchen to eat. What's important is to not draw attention to himself for being homeless.",
      "\"Police want us out of the way,\" he said, dressed in a gray jacket and carrying none of his possessions. \"Out of sight, out of mind.\"",
      "Ibrahim has been deliberate about blending in since August, when President Trump placed the district's police under federal control and ordered National Guard soldiers to patrol its streets. The president also ordered homeless people to leave immediately. \"There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY,'\" he posted.",
      "The Trump administration says encampment sweeps have reduced the visibility of homelessness, thereby enhancing the city. \"There is no disputing that Washington, DC is a safer, cleaner, and more beautiful city thanks to President Trump's historic actions to restore the nation's capital,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.",
      "While there may appear to be fewer homeless people in the nation's capital now, they have not disappeared.",
      "In interviews, homeless people said they are in a constant shuffle, hiding in plain sight. During the day, they stay on the move, grabbing meals at soup kitchens and resting on occasion in public libraries, on park benches, or at bus stops. At night, many unsheltered people bed down in business doorways, on park sidewalks, and on church stoops. Some ride the bus all night, while a few shelter in emergency rooms. Others find respite in the woods or flee to suburbs in Virginia or Maryland.",
      "There are about 5,100 homeless people in Washington, D.C., including in temporary shelters, according to an early-2025 homelessness tally. After Mr. Trump ordered the crackdown on public homelessness, people living in makeshift communities scattered and are now living in the shadows. City officials estimated in August that nearly 700 homeless people were living outdoors without tents or other shelter.",
      "As winter draws near, they are exposed to the elements and grow sicker as chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease go untreated. Street medicine providers say that, since the National Guard was deployed, they have faced enormous difficulty finding patients. Many caught up in sweeps have had their lifesaving medications thrown away, and they are more likely to miss medical appointments because they are constantly on the move. Street medicine providers say they can't find their patients to deliver medication or transport them to medical appointments. The constant chaos can suck patients with mental illness and substance use deeper into drug and alcohol addiction, raising the risk of overdose.",
      "Caseworkers report similar disruptions, saying as clients get lost, they break connections essential for obtaining housing documents, particularly IDs and Social Security cards.",
      "District officials and health providers say this cascade will make homelessness worse, threatening public health and public safety and racking up enormous costs for the health care system.",
      "\"It was already hard locating people, but the federal presence just made it worse,\" said Tobie Smith, a street medicine doctor and the executive director of Street Health D.C.",
      "The homeless shuffle",
      "Chris Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but now is homeless, having been pushed out of his tent near the White House in the initial days of the federal homelessness crackdown. He said two of his tents were taken during sweeps. Now, sleeping on a sidewalk outside a church, he doesn't bother trying to get another one. \"Why? What's the point? It'll just get thrown away again.\"",
      "Jones, 57, has a severe knee injury that prevents him from walking some days and said he was scheduled for a knee replacement in December. He said it's important to stay where he is \u2014 he relies on a nearby drugstore to refill his medications for bipolar disorder, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When he's hungry, he goes to a soup kitchen for a meal or tries to get a cheeseburger and a soda from a fast-food joint across the street.",
      "It's important for him to stay outside the church, he said, so his case manager can find him when a permanent housing slot opens up. If it gets too cold, he said, he will cross the street and sleep in the doorway of a business, which can provide a bit more shelter. He wants to get indoors, but for now, he waits.",
      "Since taking control of Washington's police force, the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on cities and counties across the nation to clear homeless encampments under threat of arrest, citation, or detention. It has ordered or threatened similar National Guard deployments in Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and other cities with large homeless populations.",
      "Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said the president is maintaining National Guard and federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital \"to ensure the long-term success of the federal operation.\" Since March, city and federal officials have removed more than 130 homeless encampments, she said, though some local homelessness experts say that number could be inflated.",
      "The Supreme Court last year made it easier for elected officials and law enforcement to fine or arrest homeless people for living outside. Then, in July of this year, the president issued an executive order calling for a nationwide crackdown on urban camping, including a massive removal of people living outdoors and forced mental health or substance use treatment.",
      "President Trump is also spearheading an overhaul of homelessness policy, moving to slash funding for permanent housing and services for homeless people. The move would limit the use of a long-standing federal policy known as \"Housing First\" that offers housing without mandating mental health or addiction treatment. The National Alliance to End Homelessness warns the move risks displacing at least 170,000 people in permanent supportive housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development paused the plan on Dec. 8 to make revisions, which it \"intends\" to do, federal housing officials said.",
      "City officials say they are complying with the Trump administration's forceful campaign against homeless people sheltering outside. Pressured by the White House, local officials said they've gotten more aggressive in breaking up camps. Advocates for homeless people say some of the sweeps have been conducted at night and others with little or no notice to move. City leaders believe they could be done more compassionately by offering services and shelter.",
      "\"We've pivoted from the notion of allowing encampments if they didn't violate public health or safety to a position of, 'We don't want you in the streets,'\" said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for District of Columbia Health and Human Services, who oversees encampment cleanups. \"It's unsafe, it's unhealthy, and it's dangerous.\" Yet he acknowledges the encampment sweeps can waste city resources as caseworkers and street medicine providers scramble to find their clients and patients.",
      "Advocates say the Trump administration is inciting fear and mistrust between homeless people and those working to help them while wasting taxpayer dollars used to provide care and place people into housing. There are, however, far fewer tents and large-scale encampments visible to tourists and residents.",
      "\"People found safety in those communities and service providers could find them. Now there are people with guns and flashing lights dislocating folks experiencing homelessness without notice and just throwing stuff away,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center.",
      "District officials say some people have accepted emergency shelter. But even as the city works to connect people with services and expand shelter capacity, officials acknowledge there isn't enough permanent housing or temporary beds for everyone.",
      "And there will be fewer places for people living outside to go.",
      "The city, in its fiscal year 2026 budget, concentrated its homelessness funding on families, funding 336 new permanent supportive housing vouchers. Yet it cut funding for temporary housing for both families and individuals and provided no new permanent supportive housing vouchers for individuals. That means fewer housing slots for single adults, who make up most of those wandering the streets. City officials said, however, that they have slotted 260 more permanent housing units for homeless individuals or families into their construction pipeline.",
      "Worsening health care",
      "The fallout is inundating local soup kitchens with demand, including Miriam's Kitchen in Foggy Bottom. The local institution provides hot meals, housing assistance, and warm blankets to people in need.",
      "Caseworkers say it's becoming increasingly difficult to help clients secure IDs and other documents needed for housing and other social services.",
      "\"I'm looking everywhere, but I can't find people,\" said Cyria Knight, a case worker at Miriam's Kitchen. \"Most of my clients went to Virginia.\"",
      "It's unclear how much of the district's homeless population has fanned out to neighboring Virginia and Maryland communities. There were an estimated 9,700 homeless people in the region in January, months before the Trump crackdown. Four of six counties around Washington saw homelessness rise from 2024, while it fell 9% in the district.",
      "\"I'm not seeing my patients for a month or more, and then when I do, their chronic conditions are uncontrolled. They've been in and out of the ER, and they're more likely to be hospitalized,\" said Anna Graham, a street medicine nurse practitioner for Unity Health Care, a network of clinics in Washington. \"It's just setting us back.\"",
      "Graham's team stations its mobile medical van outside Miriam's Kitchen at dinnertime to better find patients.",
      "Willie Taylor, 63, was figuring out where to sleep for the night after grabbing dinner from Miriam's. He saw Graham to receive his medications for advanced lung disease, seizures, chronic pain, and other health disorders.",
      "He has difficulty walking and needs a wheelchair, which is complicated because he doesn't have a permanent address. Taylor and his medical providers say his previous wheelchairs have been stolen while he slept outdoors at night. He uses a shopping cart to keep him steady, walking around all day, until nightfall.",
      "On a cold November night, Graham helped Taylor figure out his daily medications and checked his vitals. The team handed him a warm coat and hand warmers before sending him back outside.",
      "After walking for about 45 minutes, he found a piece of park pavement where he could build a bed out of tarps and sleeping bags.",
      "\"My body can't take this,\" Taylor said, preparing to sleep. \"There's ice on the concrete. I'm in so much pain; it hurts so much worse when it's cold.\"",
      "Homeless people die younger and cost the health care system more than housed people, largely because conditions go untreated on the streets, and when they do seek care, many go to the ER. Among Medicaid enrollees, homeless people have been estimated to incur $18,764 a year in spending, compared with $7,561 for other enrollees.",
      "Over at the So Others Might Eat soup kitchen earlier that day, Tyree Kelley was finishing his breakfast of a sausage sandwich and hard-boiled eggs. He was considering going into a shelter. The streets were becoming too dangerous for someone like him, he said, referring to the police and National Guard presence. He was feeling the loss of an encampment community that would watch his back.",
      "He's been to the ER at least seven times this year to get care for a broken ankle he sustained falling off an electric scooter. The accident caused him to lose his job and health insurance as a garbageman, he said. His situation has caused him to sink deeper into a depression that began three years ago after his mother died, he said.",
      "Then his father and sister died this year. He began to numb his pain with beer.",
      "\"You get so depressed, being out here,\" said Kelley, 42. \"It gets addictive. You start to not care about even changing your clothes.\"",
      "His depression also led him to seek out marijuana. Then he smoked a joint laced with fentanyl. The overdose sent him to the hospital for days.",
      "\"I actually died and came back,\" he said, crediting other homeless people with administering naloxone and saving his life. \"I need to get out of this, but I feel so stuck.\"",
      "A few blocks west of the White House sits a vacant plot of land that earlier this year held more than a dozen tents. Workers in the area sense what they don't always see.",
      "\"I was here when this was all cleared. A bulldozer came in, and all their stuff was thrown in a garbage truck,\" said Ray Szemborski, who works across the street from the now-empty lot. \"People are still homeless. I still see them around underneath the bridge. Sometimes they're at bus stops, sometimes just walking around. Their tents are gone but they're still here.\"",

      "The new jackpot has an estimated cash value of $686.5 million, Powerball said.",
      "The $1.5 billion jackpot would be the game's second-biggest this year \u2014\u00a0a $1.787 billion jackpot was hit Sept. 6 in Missouri and Texas. It would also be the fifth-largest in Powerball history and the second instance of back-to-back Powerball jackpots topping $1 billion.",
      "Wednesday's drawing was the 44th since the last time a jackpot was won \u2014 the longest such Powerball run.",
      "To win the grand prize, a ticket must match the five white balls pulled during the drawing as well as the red Powerball. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of a lump sum payment estimated at $686.5 million or a payout via an annuity that would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year. Both options are before taxes.",
      "The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to Powerball, but lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade. While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning remain exceptionally low.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 01:43:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent who covered the Vietnam and Gulf wars, has died. He was 91.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\"Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation - intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\" said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now the AP's chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, when he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak, air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \"They are hitting the center of the city.\"",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\" Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \"He sank to the ground at my feet.\"",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier's obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining the AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia's economy was in shambles and the country's enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP's Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who among them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by the AP's New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau's papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they'd have historic value someday. They're now in the AP's archives.",
      "Arnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.",
      "Ten years later, he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.",
      "In 1995, he published the memoir \"Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.\"",
      "Arnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.",
      "He was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military's war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.",
      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China's Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",
      "\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a - you know - enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.",
      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",
      "Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.",
      "Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.",
      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\"",

      "In the 209-page filing by the Justice Department, government lawyers wrote that the U.S. \"admits that it owed a duty of care to Plaintiffs, which it breached, thereby proximately causing the tragic accident on January 29, 2025.\"",
      "The filing states that the crew of the Army Black Hawk helicopter\u00a0\u2014 which was conducting a training mission with night-vision goggles on the night of the crash \u2014 failed to establish and maintain proper and safe visual separation with a regional American Eagle flight that was approaching runway 33 at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. American Eagle and PSA Airlines are subsidiaries of American Airlines.",
      "The Army Black Hawk helicopter pilots \"failed to maintain vigilance so as to see and avoid other aircraft and their failure was a cause-infact and proximate cause of the accident,\" the filing states.",
      "It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since November 2001.",
      "The Justice Department also identified an air traffic controller in the DCA tower as partially to blame for the accident, arguing the controller \"negligently violated\" a Federal Aviation Administration order by \"failing to follow the procedures for visual separation\" between the helicopter and passenger jet.",
      "At the time of the accident, there was one controller managing helicopter traffic in the area and departures and arrivals at DCA, according to multiple sources.",
      "The extraordinary revelation by the U.S. government was in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of Casey Crafton, one of the passengers on the jetliner.",

      "Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's two other children have spoken out for the first time as their brother,\u00a0Nick Reiner, appeared in court to face charges for the murders of his parents.",
      "Jake and Romy Reiner released the following statement on Wednesday:",
      "\"Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day. The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.",
      "\"We are grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support we have received not only from family and friends but people from all walks of life. We now ask for respect and privacy, for speculation to be tempered with compassion and humanity, and for our parents to be remembered for the incredible lives they lived and the love they gave.\"",
      "Rob Reiner had another adopted child, Tracy Reiner, from his previous marriage to actress Penny Marshall. The two were together for 10 years beginning in 1971.",
      "The \"When Harry Met Sally...\" director met Michele Singer, a photographer, while working on the romantic comedy. In a 2016 interview with AV Club, he said meeting her was what made him change the ending of the movie, to have Harry and Sally end up together.",
      "The couple got married in 1989, the same year the film was released. They had three children together.",
      "Their youngest, 28-year-old Romy Reiner, is a photographer and an artist.",
      "Jake Reiner, 34, their eldest, was a news reporter in Texas and California, including at CBS Los Angeles, before he followed in his father's footsteps. He acted in a few TV shows and films, including \"Being Charlie,\" which was directed by his father.",
      "Nick Reiner was also credited in \"Being Charlie\" as a writer. The film, which told the story of a teenager struggling with drug addiction and rehab, was \"loosely based on things Nick went through and his relationship to me and his mother,\" Rob Reiner said in a 2016\u00a0AOL interview\u00a0alongside his son. \"It was intense. It was difficult at times.\"",
      "The 32-year-old has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances in the killing of his parents, who were found dead in their home over the weekend, according to Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman. The DA said the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole or the death penalty, but that his office hasn't decided which to pursue.",
      "The district attorney's office said in a statement that Rob and Michele Reiner were stabbed to death. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed Wednesday that their causes of death were \"multiple sharp force injuries.\" It wasn't clear as of Wednesday morning when exactly the attack happened, or how long the couple had been dead before their bodies were discovered on Sunday. The day before, they had gone to a party at Conan O'Brien's, where Rob and Nick Reiner had a brief but loud argument, sources who were there told CBS News.",
      "Nick Reiner has not entered a plea. He appeared in court on Wednesday and only said, \"yes, your honor,\" to agree to the arraignment date.",
      "Police have not released details about evidence in the case, or any information about a possible motive or what led them to arrest Nick Reiner.",
      "Newly released video shows Nick Reiner inside a gas station convenience store hours after the killings and just moments before he was arrested on Sunday. Video from outside the store shows the LAPD arriving and\u00a0arresting him. He did not resist arrest, according to police.",
      "He is now being held without bail in a jail in downtown Los Angeles.",

    "summary": "As the search entered its fifth day, authorities have so far been unable to identify a person of interest in the shooting that killed two students and wounded nine others over the weekend.",
    "story": [
      "Law enforcement officials in Providence, Rhode Island, on Wednesday confirmed that witnesses' description of the gunman in the\u00a0Brown University\u00a0shooting matches the images they have released of the person of interest in the case.",
      "As the search entered its fifth day, authorities have so far been unable to identify the person of interest in the shooting that killed\u00a0two students\u00a0and wounded nine others over the weekend. Police on Wednesday also released a map of the area showing the streets where they say a person of interest is confirmed to have been on Saturday, the day of the shooting.",
      "Police on Wednesday also\u00a0asked for the public's help\u00a0in identifying someone who they say was seen in the area near the person of interest, so they could speak to him. Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez  said the person investigators want to speak to appeared to have come near the person of interest at the corner of Benevolent and Cooke streets. In a video released by police, the person of interest appeared to suddenly stop and turn around as he approached the corner.",
      "\"I want to urge you, the public, not to rely on AI generated images that are currently being shared on social media,\" Perez warned at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. \"The updates and information you're getting will be provided exclusively through this department's social channels.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter if \"any items of interest\" have been found during the search so far, specifically clothing, Perez responded \"nothing as we speak, no.\"",
      "In order to avoid any misinformation, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said police have created a page on the department's website where all the digital evidence is currently published.",
      "Two of the wounded victims have so far been treated and released from the hospital, according to Smiley. One person remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition, and five others are in stable condition. The ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries.",
      "Several videos of a person of interest in the case were released earlier this week. They show what police say are \"enhanced\" images captured on the East Side of Providence on Saturday afternoon, approximately two hours before the shooting.",
      "The person of interest, who is wearing a face covering, is seen walking on a sidewalk and looking around \u2014 but it does not clearly show where the person went afterward, police said.",
      "\"At this point it's unknown to us where this person works, it's unknown to us if he was an affiliate of Brown, that's all unknown to us,\" Perez said.",
      "Perez also confirmed Wednesday that only one weapon was used. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha then interrupted a reporter's question about the gun, saying that certain details about the case don't advance the investigation if they're released to the public.",
      "\"As we interview witnesses, we don't want them to learn facts from these press conferences. We want them to relay the facts they have in their heads,\" Neronha said. \"We're being careful about the facts that we're sharing for that reason.\"",
      "\"He will be caught, it's just a matter of time before we catch him,\" Neronha later said of the gunman.",
      "ENHANCED VIDEO: We are releasing an enhanced video of the person of interest in the Brown University incident. Footage was captured on the East Side of Providence on Saturday afternoon before the incident.Please share widely and contact the official tip line if you have\u2026 pic.twitter.com/mewBSflOiO",
      "Some of the footage released Tuesday by the Providence Police Department on social media appeared to be digitally enhanced versions of previously released videos. Police urged anyone with information to contact the FBI tip line online or at 401-272-3121.",
      "\"Even small details may be critical to this,\" police said.",
      "A source briefed on the investigation told CBS News the lack of usable surveillance video is significantly hampering the search for the shooter. That limitation is key reason police widened their request for video and photos on Wednesday to large perimeter around Brown University's campus.",
      "Investigators are specifically looking for footage that could show the suspect entering a vehicle, apartment, or residence in the moments after the shooting. An image released earlier Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far since the shooting on Saturday.",
      "The FBI said the person of interest is about 5-foot-8 with a stocky build. The agency has also shared a timeline of when the videos were captured, including some videos that appear to have been obtained from residents' private cameras. The person of interest is seen from about 2 p.m. on Saturday until just after 4 p.m., around the time the shooting took place.",
      "Police said the individual was walking near Hope and Benevolent streets, just down the block from the Barus & Holley engineering building where the gunman opened fire. Authorities said Monday they had no information about a motive at this point.",
      "The FBI has offered a\u00a0$50,000 reward\u00a0for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the gunman.",
      "Amid growing questions about campus security measures and the lack of better surveillance video, the university released a statement Wednesday saying that while Brown has \"an expansive network of security cameras,\" the cameras \"do not extend to every hallway, classroom, laboratory and office across the 250+ buildings on campus.\"",
      "\"Brown has heightened security on campus considerably in recent days, and we will do a large-scale systematic security review of the entire campus. We know we live in a different time,\" the statement said.",

    "summary": "Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, saying \"the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.\"",
      "Smith was subpoenaed to testify earlier this month by the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel during the Biden administration. The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of Mr. Trump led by Smith.",
      "Following the question-and-answer session, Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Panel, said Smith answered every question to \"the satisfaction of any reasonable minded person in that room.\"",
      "Smith \"spent several hours schooling the Judiciary Committee on the professional responsibilities of a prosecutor and the ethical duties of a prosecutor,\" Raskin said. \"And he's a sensational and honorable public servant, and we are lucky to have him in the bar in the United States.\"",
      "Rep. Daniel Goldman, a Democrat from New York, criticized Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jim Jordan for having Smith testify behind closed doors first. Previous special counsels, including Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have appeared before lawmakers for public hearings. Mueller investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Hur probed former President Joe Biden's handling of sensitive government documents.",
      "\"The accusations against him are complete bogus, and the American people should hear that for themselves,\" he said.",
      "The president was indicted on more than 40 federal charges in two separate cases. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The president has denied wrongdoing and claimed Smith's investigations were politically motivated \"witch hunts\" that intended to harm his candidacy for the White House.",
      "Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "In portions of Smith's opening statement to the committee obtained by CBS News, the former special counsel defended his prosecutorial record and told lawmakers that he made decisions in the investigations \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "\"The decision to bring charges against President Trump was mine, but the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions, as alleged in the indictments returned by grand juries in two different districts,\" Smith told lawmakers.",
      "He continued: \"Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "Smith said the documents investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, Smith said, \"then repeatedly tried to obstruct justice to conceal his continued retention of those documents.\"",
      "In other portions of his opening statement, Smith defended investigative steps taken by his team, including obtaining phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers as part of the 2020 election probe. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, published a document in October alleging that the FBI obtained phone data from eight GOP senators and one Republican House member as part of the probe.",
      "The records, Smith said, \"were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation.\"",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith said. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "Lanny Breuer, an attorney who represents the former special counsel, told reporters that Smith \"is showing tremendous courage in light of the remarkable and unprecedented retribution campaign against him by this administration and this White House.\"",
      "Smith is also under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position as special counsel. His lawyers called the ethics probe by the Office of the Special Counsel \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A walkway in the White House's West Wing that President Trump has dubbed the \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" now features partisan plaques installed under the portraits of his predecessors.",
      "From \"Sleepy Joe\" Biden references to painting Republican icon Ronald Reagan as a fan of a young Mr. Trump, the plaques include language written in Trumpian style. The installation is the president's latest move to shape the White House in his image, an effort that has spanned from adding gilded decor in the Oval Office to razing the East Wing in preparation for a massive ballroom addition.",
      "An introductory plaque tells passersby that the Presidential Walk of Fame was \"conceived, built, and dedicated by President Donald J. Trump as a tribute to past Presidents, good, bad, and somewhere in the middle.\"",
      "Biden's plaque repeats a false claim that the 46th president, a Democrat, took office \"as a result of the most corrupt election ever,\" when, in fact, he defeated Mr. Trump in 2020 in both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Biden is also described as \"by far, the worst president in American history.\"",
      "Another Democrat, Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president and Mr. Trump's first presidential predecessor, is labeled \"one of the most divisive political figures in American history.\"",
      "The plaque below former President George W. Bush's portrait appears to approve of the Republican's creation of the Department of Homeland Security but decries that he \"started wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which should not have happened.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the texts are \"eloquently written descriptions of each president\" and that \"many were written directly by the president himself.\"",
      "Biden had no comment on his plaque. There were no immediate responses to emails sent to aides for Obama and several other former presidents.",
      "Mr. Trump in September refashioned the colonnade that runs from the West Wing to the White House residence with gilded portraits of all former presidents, except for Biden. For him, Mr. Trump instead chose a picture of an\u00a0autopen, reflecting his contention that Biden was not up to the job.",

      "\"The Presidential Walk of Fame will long live as a testament and tribute to the Greatness of America,\" the introductory plaque declares.",
      "As Mr. Trump makes his mark on the White House grounds, the Trump administration is facing a lawsuit\u00a0from the National Trust for Historic Preservation over the demolition of the East Wing and plans for the new ballroom. The Trump administration insists it didn't need approvals for the demolition.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon on Tuesday denied a motion by the preservation group that would have temporarily blocked construction\u00a0of the new ballroom, but he set out some requirements for the Trump administration moving forward.",
      "The president also undertook a major overhaul of the South Lawn, paving over a former grassy area with concrete to easier facilitate tables and chairs.",
      "The plaques of past presidents were revealed to the press as the president prepared to give a year-end address Wednesday to tout his accomplishments in his first 11 months in office and lay out plans for the next three years.",

      "The day before, they had gone to a party at Conan O'Brien's, where Rob and Nick Reiner had a brief but loud argument, sources who were there told CBS News. Nick Reiner checked into a hotel in Santa Monica about four miles away early Sunday morning, two sources told CBS News.",

      "In \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" Reiner famously featured a brief appearance from his mother, Estelle, who delivered the iconic line, \"I'll have what she's having.\" It was also during the filming of \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" that Rob Reiner first met Michele. In a 2016 interview with AV Club, he said meeting her was what made him change the ending of the movie to have Harry and Sally end up together.",
      "Hollywood, political leaders react",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement Sunday night: \"This is a devastating loss for our city and our country.

      "Former President Bill Clinton said Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi called word of the Reiners' deaths \"devastating.

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all.",
      "The tension between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest single economies, has ebbed and flowed during Mr. Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to reunify with the mainland. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to make that a reality.",
      "If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during the Biden administration.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.",
      "The State Department said the sales serve \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"",
      "\"The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\" the statements said.",
      "China blasts U.S.-Taiwan arms deals, says they \"will only end up backfiring\"",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",
      "\"The 'Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.",
      "\"This cannot save the doomed fate of 'Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for 'Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\" Guo added.",
      "The U.S. role in Taiwan's \"self-defense capabilities\"",
      "Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.",
      "President Trump, in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes aired in early November, said Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't bring up the issue of Taiwan when the two leaders met in late October, but he said Xi knew \"the consequences\" of taking military action against the island.",
      "\"He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But they understand what's gonna happen. He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell whether he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if Xi did move militarily on the island, Mr. Trump said, \"I can't give away my secrets.\"",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \"sufficient self-defense capabilities\" and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \"is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\" the ministry said.",
      "Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.",
      "The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Mr. Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.",
      "The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Mr. Trump is expected to sign shortly.",
      "Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.",

    "summary": "The father and son suspects in the Bondi Beach terror attack spent most of November in a hotel in the Philippines, but the reason for their visit remains unclear.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities investigating the Bondi Beach terrorist attack have been looking into a month-long trip taken by the suspects, father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram, to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this week that the attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City said the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Jojo, who works at at the GV Hotel in Davao, told CBS News on Thursday that Sajid and Naveed Akram, the elder of whom was killed during the Sunday attack, checked into the hotel on Nov. 1 and then left on Nov. 28.",
      "He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said there was nothing particularly suspicious about the father and son, who had one piece of luggage and one backpack between them.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC previously reported that the Bondi Beach attackers had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But on Wednesday, Philippine presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said there was \"no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "There has been an Islamist insurgency in the southern Philippines for many years, but the two main militant groups involved are not affiliated with ISIS, Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College, who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "There is a relatively small splinter group called Abu Sayyaf based on a remote archipelago that is affiliated with ISIS, but Smith said it would be very difficult for foreigners to receive weapons training from the group.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Australian and Indian authorities have confirmed that Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, traveled on an India passport, while his son, born in Australia, used an Australian passport.",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, was wounded during the attack, but woke up from a coma earlier this week and was quickly charged with 59 individual offenses, including 15 murder charges.",

    "story": [
      "A French court on Thursday sentenced a doctor to life in jail for\u00a0poisoning 30 child and adult patients, 12 of whom died, reportedly in an attempt to discredit coworkers.",
      "Frederic Pechier, 53, worked as an anesthetist in two clinics in the eastern city of Besancon, when patients went into cardiac arrest in suspicious circumstances between 2008 and 2017. Twelve could not be resuscitated.",
      "Pechier's youngest victim, four-year-old Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.",
      "\"You will be incarcerated immediately,\" presiding judge Delphine Thibierge said.",
      "Pechier, who has denied wrongdoing and had not been detained since the start of the probe, appeared unmoved. Members of his family broke down in tears.",
      "A lawyer from the firm representing him, Ornella Spatafora, said he would appeal.",
      "An investigation was launched in 2017, after suspicious cardiac arrests were recorded during operations on patients considered low-risk.",
      "During the more than three-month trial, prosecutors called for Pechier to be jailed for life, saying he \"used medicine to kill.\"",
      "They say he contaminated IV bags with potassium, local anaesthetics, adrenaline, and even an anticoagulant to trigger cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients being treated by colleagues.",
      "His goal, prosecutors said, was to \"psychologically hurt\" caregivers with whom he was in conflict and to \"feed his thirst for power\".",
      "Pechier had argued during the probe that the majority of poisonings were the result of \"medical errors\" made by his colleagues.",
      "He admitted during the trial that there had been a person poisoning patients in one of the two clinics where he worked, but said it was not him.",
      "\"I am not a poisoner,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever the outcome of all this, my career is over,\" Pechier told reporters at a press conference in 2019, BBC News\u00a0reported. \"You cannot trust a doctor who, at one point, has been labeled a poisoner. ... My family is broken and I am afraid for my children.\"",
      "Some colleagues described the doctor as a \"star anesthetist,\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",
      "One colleague described Pechier as a very good doctor with an \"oversized ego.\"",
      "Le Monde reported\u00a0that one of Pechier's lawyers withdrew from the case, citing insufficient compensation.",
      "In tears during the trial earlier this month, Pechier recounted trying to kill himself in 2021.",
      "The verdict comes after a court in May sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients, most of them children, between 1989 and 2014.",
      "That case raised questions about how he was allowed to continue practicing until retirement despite at least one colleague sounding the alarm.",

      "Pineida started his professional career at Independiente del Valle, where he played from 2010 to 2015. He then moved to the club of the coastal city of Guayaquil in 2016 and won two league titles there. The defender also had a brief spell at Brazil's Fluminense in 2022.",

      "The New South Wales state police force said in a statement that two cars were intercepted by tactical operations officers responding \"to information received that a violent act was possibly being planned.\"",
      "The operation was conducted in Sydney's southwest suburb of Liverpool, about a half hour drive away from Bondi Beach. Police said they had \"not identified any connection to the current police investigation of the Bondi terror attack.\"",

It marks the latest in a series of strikes dating back to early September that the U.S. has conducted on what it claims are drug-trafficking vessels in the region.",

    "summary": "The votes follow a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The latest Democratic-led attempt to limit President Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region failed Wednesday, as tensions with the South American country continue to escalate.",
      "House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump has warned that land strikes against the country could commence \"soon.\" Mr. Trump's threats come amid a months-long military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 95 people.",
      "Both measures fell short.",
      "The first measure, introduced by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, would remove U.S. armed forces \"from hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere,\" unless Congress has declared war or authorized the use of military force for such purposes. It failed in a 210 to 216 vote.",
      "A second measure from Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts would remove the armed forces \"from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" Some 211 voted in favor and 213 voted against it.",
      "Meeks' resolution had the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Don Bacon of Nebraska, while Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against it.",
      "Three Republicans \u2014 Massie, Bacon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 supported McGovern's resolution. Cuellar was the lone Democrat to vote against.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. But the White House has suggested that the decades-old law does not apply to the boat strikes because it does not view the attacks as putting service members in harm's way.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held two separate classified briefings Tuesday for all senators and House members. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee received a more detailed briefing on Wednesday with Navy Adm. Frank Bradley, who ordered a second strike killing survivors of the initial Sept. 2 boat attack.",
      "Meeks left Tuesday's House briefing saying members received no adequate explanation for why the Trump administration has not consulted Congress before the strikes. He also questioned the president's motivations.",
      "\"It doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking,\" Meeks told reporters Tuesday. \"So if this is about regime change, it seems to me that the administration should say that's what it is, and should come to Congress to ask for that authorization, which has not taken place.\"",
      "Bacon said after Wednesday's briefing that he would vote to authorize military action against Venezuela, but he still believes that Mr. Trump needs to get approval from Congress.",
      "\"I think there's enough support in Congress to pass an authorization,\" Bacon added. \"The mission is right, but continued hostilities does require congressional approval.\"",
      "A day before the votes, Vanity Fair published a piece based on nearly a dozen interviews with Mr. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, in which she said the president \"wants to keep on blowing boats up until [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.\"",
      "The statement appeared to be in contradiction with the administration's stance that it is conducting the strikes to stop the flow of drugs to the U.S., not ousting Maduro.",
      "Wiles conceded that strikes on land would require congressional approval.",
      "\"If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then [we'd need] Congress,\" she told Vanity Fair.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"very concerned\" about the U.S. actions around Venezuela.",
      "\"At this point, we still don't have a clear idea of what the president is trying to accomplish,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"But it sure looks like he's trying to accomplish regime change in Venezuela, and that he's willing to go to war and accomplish that, all without any congressional authorization.\"",
      "In a further escalation of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Maduro, the president on Tuesday said he was declaring the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization\" and called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that the president has the authority to order the boat strikes under his constitutional authority.",
      "\"It is certainly appropriate,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. \"It's necessary to protect the United States and our interests.\"",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued the president does not need congressional authorization to carry out \"precise, limited strikes.\"",
      "\"This president wants to be the judge, jury and the executioner,\" said Meeks, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat.",
      "The House votes follow two failed efforts in the Senate to prohibit Mr. Trump from continuing military action against drug cartels without approval from Congress. A third Senate vote could happen as soon as this week.",
      "Jaala  Brown, \n                                                  \n                      Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                                  Patrick  Maguire\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A Second Amendment clash has erupted between the federal government and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "The U.S. government sued the U.S. territory, its police department and Police Commissioner Mario Brooks on Tuesday, accusing them of obstructing and systematically denying American citizens the right to possess and carry guns.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands requires that applicants demonstrate \"good reason to fear death or great injury to his person or property,\" and to have \"two credible persons\" to vouch for their need of a firearm. Local law also requires that someone have \"good moral character\" to obtain a gun permit, which is valid for up to three years and applies to a single weapon.",
      "The lawsuit states that no specific standard has been set or defined for the requirement of character. It also claims that the defendants \"regularly\" refuse to issue permits to those who by law are \"deemed to be an improper person\" by the territory's police commissioner.",
      "The lawsuit states that those in the U.S. territory also must \"submit to intrusive and warrantless home searches\" as one condition to obtain a gun permit. If an applicant refuses a home inspection, which takes \"several months to a year to schedule and complete,\" the government will not process their request, according to the lawsuit.",
      "It also notes that the police department \"denies firearms licenses to otherwise qualified applicants whenever it deems that the applicant has 'too many' firearms.\"",
      "In addition, the lawsuit accuses the U.S. Virgin Islands of demanding that applicants \"unnecessarily spend money to install a safe,\" and that it be bolted to the floor or wall of their home.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the defendants of defying \"binding Supreme Court precedent to frustrate the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens.\"",
      "It notes that those citizens \"have a fundamental right to possess guns in their homes\" and carry handguns publicly for the purpose of immediate self-defense.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It asks that a judge find that the defendants are violating the Second Amendment and seeks an injunction to prohibit them from implementing local laws tied to the issuance of firearms licenses.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands government said in a statement late Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit and taking the allegations seriously.",
      "It noted that the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. and Lt. Gov. Tregenza A. Roach \"is committed to protecting constitutional rights while maintaining public safety.\"",
      "The statement said that the allegations would be addressed in court, and that no further comment would be issued.",
      "The lawsuit was filed as the administration of President Trump pushes to expand gun rights. Last year, Trump claimed that the Second Amendment was \"under siege\" and described himself as \"the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uk-police-antisemitism-protests-more-assertive-bondi-beach-attack/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After Bondi Beach attack, Britain's two biggest police forces indicate they will arrest people who use \"phrases causing fear in Jewish communities.\"",
    "story": [
      "Britain's two biggest police forces announced Wednesday that officers would take an \"enhanced approach\" to counter antisemitism, arresting protesters who use certain slogans and phrases, in response to a surge in\u00a0hate crimes targeting Jewish people in the United Kingdom.",
      "The\u00a0announcement was a response, the London Metropolitan and Greater Manchester Police forces said, to Sunday's\u00a0terrorist attack in Bondi Beach, Australia, targeting a Hanukkah event, in which 15 people were fatally shot. Police also cited a spate of incidents on British soil, including a vehicle and knife assault outside a synagogue in Manchester in October that left two Jewish people dead.",
      "\"Antisemitic hate crime has surged, protests have intensified, and online abuse has grown since 2023,\" the police forces said. \"The increased fear in Jewish communities, and high number of terrorist attacks disrupted in recent years requires an enhanced response.\"",
      "\"The words and chants used, especially in protests, matter and have real world consequences,\" the statement said. \"Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive.\"",
      "The forces said that officers \"have consistently been advised\" by British prosecutors that \"many of the phrases causing fear in Jewish communities don't meet prosecution thresholds\" under the U.K.'s current hate speech laws, so the new approach would work largely under the existing Public Order Act.",
      "\"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalize the intifada' and those using it at future protest or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action,\" the police said. \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\"",
      "\"The current laws are inadequate,\" said the statement attributed to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and Manchester Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson, adding that the forces welcomed a planned review by the government of existing public order and hate crime laws.",
      "\"Jewish communities across London, Greater Manchester, and the rest of the United Kingdom are already worried and scared,\" the police statement said, and that the attacks in Australia and Manchester \"only adds to it.\"",
      "The police said officers would be briefed on this new approach, calling the measures \"practical and immediate,\" but offering little detail on what, beyond the specific phrase about a global \"intifada,\" might now be deemed illegal behavior.",
      "It said there had already been stepped-up police patrols around synagogues, Jewish schools and community venues.",
      "\"Our intent is clear: create a hostile environment for offenders and a safer environment for Jewish communities, while protecting lawful protest,\" the police said. \"It is possible to protest in support of Palestinian people without intimidating Jewish communities or breaking the law.\"",
      "One of the leaders of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.K., Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal, criticized the announcement by the British police, calling it \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights,\" according to CBS News' partner network BBC News.",
      "He said there was no consultation with his organization \"before making this far-reaching statement on our rights.\"",
      "\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Jamal said.",
      "The Board of Deputies of British Jews advocacy group said in a social media post that its members \"strongly welcome this necessary intervention\" by the police forces, which it said came \"after repeated urging from the Board of Deputies and others.\"",
      "Australia takes a different approach",
      "Authorities in Australia are still in the early days of their investigation into the Bondi Beach attack, but they have faced sharp criticism from the Jewish community in Sydney and abroad over a perceived lack of preparedness given a documented rise in antisemitism.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said it was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" and he and was quick to label it \"an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism.\"",
      "Albanese said just hours after the attack that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\"",
      "Police have said the suspects \u2014 a father and son \u2014   used rifles and shotguns owned legally by the older man. Albanese proposed new laws to limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and a review into how existing licenses could be subject to renewal over time.",
      "Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales state, where Bondi Beach is located, said Monday that the attack \"demands an overwhelming response,\" announcing that more than 320 police officers would be \"deployed today, and we will continue to increase that number.\"",
      "He said Tuesday that the state was looking at reforms that could include denying permission for protests after terror events.",
      "\"My concern is that a mass demonstration in this combustible situation with our multicultural community could light a flame that would be impossible to extinguish,\" Minns told reporters, according to The Guardian newspaper. \"In many cases, particularly in relation to restrictions on protests, there are constitutional issues. So, it has to be drafted in a particular way. We have to be very clear about the designation and the reason for it. I'm being crystal clear about it. I'm worried about a combustible situation and community harmony. That's the reason we would introduce this legislation. It's begun, the drafting process has begun. But when it's completed I'll let you know.\"",
      "The state premier added, however, that there had been \"a lot of conflation that protests lead to violence because some chants are being said, yet the events on Sunday were not related to a protest at all.\"",
      "Minns said any new law brought in would target no specific group, but rather \"be a blanket rule in place\" only in the wake of a terrorist incident.",
      "Albanese, speaking in a radio interview on Wednesday, highlighted some of the measures his government has already taken to address antisemitism, including appointing the nation's first ever envoy dedicated to the topic.",
      "\"We've strengthened legislation to address antisemitism and hateful conduct \u2014 criminalized hate speech advocating violence,\" Albanese said, noting also \"a landmark ban on the Nazi salute and hate symbols\" adopted last year.",
      "\"We've enhanced protection of Jewish communities,\" the prime minister said, adding in conclusion: \"There's more to do.\"",

    "summary": "Ahmed al Ahmed, the Syrian-Australian father who wrestled a shotgun from one of the gunmen attacking a Jewish gathering, is facing a long road to recovery.",
    "story": [
      "Like many Australians strolling at Bondi Beach on long, warm summer evenings, Ahmed al Ahmed just wanted a cup of coffee with a friend. Around him, a bloody massacre erupted as two gunmen targeted Jews during Hanukkah festivities at a park close to the shore.",
      "Soon al Ahmed was creeping, bent over, between two parked cars, before barreling directly toward one of the unsuspecting shooters. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the 44-year-old father can be seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker.",
      "The story of the Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner who put an end to the rampage of one of the shooters on Sunday has been seized upon by a country desperately seeking comfort after one of its darkest hours: the slaying of 15 people as they celebrated their Jewish faith.",
      "\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday, as he left a Sydney hospital where al Ahmed is being treated for gunshot wounds. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",
      "A fundraising page established by Australians who had never met al Ahmed had attracted by Tuesday night donations by some 40,000 people, who gave 2.3 million Australian dollars ($1.5 million). Among the supporters was the billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who pledged AU$99,000.",
      "Al Ahmed, who is married with two young daughters, faces a long struggle ahead, those who have spoken to him since Sunday's massacre say. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman in the attack as the man fired indiscriminately from a footbridge.",
      "He has already undergone surgery and more operations are scheduled, said Lubaba alhmidi Alkahil, a spokesperson for the Australians for Syria Association, who visited al Ahmed in a hospital late Monday. The \"quiet and humble\" man was conscious but frail and faced at least six months of recovery, Alkahil said.",
      "Under Australia's national, tax-funded health care system, Al Ahmed, who is a permanent legal resident of the country, is unlikely to face any bills for his care.",
      "In the days since the attack, a pile of floral tributes and notes of thanks has grown outside the small convenience store al Ahmed owns opposite a train station in suburban Sydney. Meanwhile, he has received visits at the hospital from Australia's leaders, apparently telling Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, that he'd take the same action again.",
      "He has been hailed as a hero by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia's Governor General, who is the representative of Britain's King Charles in the country. Minns said al Ahmed saved \"countless\" lives in what the premier said was \"the most unbelievable scene I've ever seen.\"",
      "Al Ahmed lived in the town of Nayrab in Syria's Idlib region before he arrived in Australia, his cousin Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. He left Syria in 2006 after finishing his studies, before the 2011 mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad that were met with a brutal crackdown and spiraled into a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "Nayrab was heavily bombed by Assad's forces with most of the town's houses flattened and reduced to rubble. On Tuesday, al Ahmed was the talk of the town.",
      "\"Ahmed did really a heroic job,\" his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. \"Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.\"",
      "Ahmed al Ahmed's parents, who came to Sydney this year to reunite with their son, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that their son had served with the police and in the central security forces in Syria. Father Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said his son's \"conscience and soul\" compelled him to act on Sunday.",
      "\"I feel pride and honor because my son is a hero of Australia,\" the father said.",
      "In the aftermath of the mass killing, a country roiling from one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever on its soil - allegedly committed by an Australian resident who arrived from India in 1998 and his Australian-born son - looked for hope amid their grief.",
      "Other stories of heroism have also emerged.",
      "They included the tale of a married couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were both killed while trying to stop one of the shooters as he climbed from his car and began the massacre, their family has told Australian news outlets.",
      "\"Bondi locals, together they lived honest, hardworking lives and treated everyone they met with kindness, warmth and respect,\" the family said in a statement. \"Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void.\"",
      "Reuven Morrison, 62, was also killed while trying to stop the horror, according to his daughter, Sheina Gutnick. After al Ahmed wrestled the gun from one shooter, Morrison can be seen throwing objects at the gunman - before he was shot by the second man.",
      "\"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members,\" Gutnick told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "Acts of courage like these were cited by many on social media and in news outlets as examples of what being Australian should mean.",
      "\"When he did what he did, he wasn't thinking at all about the background of the people he's saving, the people dying in the street,\" Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said of his son. \"He doesn't discriminate between one nationality and another, especially here in Australia there's no difference between one citizen and another.\"",

    "title": "Arctic temperatures rising twice as fast as elsewhere, NOAA report says",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arctic-temperatures-climate-change-noaa-report/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:02:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

    "summary": "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that the terror attack on Jewish people at Bondi Beach was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "The father and son suspects in the terror attack on Jewish people gathered for a Hanukkah event in Bondi Beach, Australia, spent most of November in the Philippines, police said Tuesday. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, meanwhile, that the attack was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
      "New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went between Nov. 1 and 28. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, and his 24-year-old son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, had listed the southern city of Davao as their final destination on the trip.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC reported the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Asian nation, citing security sources.",
      "Philippine officials denied it. Presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "\"People have traveled and networked amongst these groups, but very, very rarely,\" Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News. \"And this is often overblown.\"",
      "The Philippines' history with Islamist insurgency",
      "Islamist separatists have operated in the southern Philippines for decades \u2014 it's \"an insurgency which is almost 100 years in the making,\" according to Smith.",
      "He said two longstanding militant groups \u2014 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, known as the MILF, and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF \u2014 have been \"sort of the grandfather, old rebellious groups of the Islamist movement\" in the Philippines.",
      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the country.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday that the father and son suspects in the antisemitic terror attack on a Hanukkah gathering on Bondi Beach were inspired by ISIS, as officials in India confirmed that the older man was originally from that nation.",
      "Authorities also revealed that gunmen had recently returned from the Philippines, where they traveled to an area known as a hotbed for terrorist groups.",
      "The mass shooting on the famous beach left 15 innocent people dead, including a 10-year-old girl and an Holocaust survivor. The attack was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" Albanese said Tuesday as he visited one of the heroes who tried to stop the attackers.",
      "Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett also said Tuesday that it was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" referring to the now disparate group that, for several years, held a huge swathe of territory spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "The suspects, a father and son aged 50 and 24, used guns that were owned legally by the older man, whom officials in New South Wales state have named as Sajid Akram. He was shot dead at the scene, and his son was still being treated in a hospital on Tuesday, where he had regained consciousness.",
      "Police said Wednesday that the younger man was charged with 59 offenses including 15 counts of murder and one of terrorism.",
      "Indian police confirm father was from Hyderabad",
      "Police in the southern Indian state of Telangana confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Sajid Akram was originally from the city of Hyderabad. In a statement, the police said he earned a degree in Hyderabad before migrating to Australia in November 1998, where he married a woman of European origin.",
      "Sajid Akram held an Indian passport, while his son Naveed and a daughter were both born in Australia and are citizens of the country, the police said, confirming previous statements by Australian officials about the son's nationality. U.S. officials had told CBS News soon after the attack that at least one of the Akrams was believed to be a Pakistani national, but that appears to have been a case of mistaken identity, and a man with the same name as the younger suspect has come forward in Sydney to say he was wrongly identified.",
      "The Telangana police said the elder Akram had \"limited contact with his family in Hyderabad over the past 27 years,\" visiting six times since he migrated to Australia, \"primarily for family-related reasons.\"",
      "The police statement said family members in India had \"expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalization, and that the son's apparent radicalization appeared \"to have no connection with India.\"",
      "Australian officials have confirmed that homemade ISIS flags were found \u2014   along with an improvised explosive device \u2014   in the suspects' vehicle at Bondi Beach on Sunday, and police provided new information on Tuesday about their recent movements.",
      "Suspected gunmen spent most of November in the Philippines",
      "Both men traveled to the Philippines in November, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters on Tuesday, adding that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went.",
      "The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said both Sajid Akram and his son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, spent most of November \u2014 from the 1st until the 28th \u2014   in the Philippines, and listing the city of Davao as their final destination.",
      "Muslim separatists, including the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group that once publicly backed ISIS, are active in that part of the southern Philippines. ABC, the Australian public broadcaster, said the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But Philippines presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "That group and others in the region have drawn and trained some foreign militants from across Asia, the Middle East and Europe in the past, according to the Associated Press, though Abu Sayyaf has been weakened in recent years by repeated military offensives.",
      "The AP cited Philippine military and police officials as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Did Australian officials fail the Jewish community?",
      "Australian officials confirmed Monday that Naveed Akram was under investigation for about six months during 2019 for suspected links to a Sydney-based terror cell, though the nation's primary spy agency found he represented no threat, and officials said the probe had focused on associates.",
      "Australia's ABC network\u00a0reported that his ties included \"longstanding links\" to members of a pro-ISIS cell in Australia, including contact with alleged jihadist spiritual leader Wisam Haddad and a man named Youssef Uweinat, who was convicted of recruiting young people in Australia to Islamic extremism.",
      "A lawyer for Haddad has denied that the cleric had \"any knowledge of or involvement in the shootings that took place at Bondi Beach,\" according to the network.",
      "Many people, from the daughter of one of the victims, to a former Australian leader, have told CBS News the men's history should have raised serious red flags, if not stopped them before they claimed so many lives.",
      "Israeli officials have harshly criticized Australia's government for failing to protect Jewish people amid a sharp rise in recent years of antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We are now facing here a surge of antisemitism, and Australians of Jewish faith are not feeling secure in their own country, and this is insane,\" Israeli Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon told CBS News on Tuesday, urging Australian leaders to create opportunities for young people of different faiths to come together, \"and not once a year, but on a weekly basis.\"",
      "Maimon also said \"boundaries should be set\" by Australian authorities, referring to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been held in the country.",
      "\"I believe that it's very important to make sure that while the principle of freedom of expression should be kept, there should be also a limit to the language that some protesters, and in some protests, we hear,\" he said. \"I always believe that there is room to do more. Always. I'm asking myself every day, 'what can I do better? How can I do better?' And I'm trying to do it. And I do expect the Australian government to do better.\"",
      "Former Australian leader says there are no easy answers",
      "Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told CBS News on Tuesday that the national government undoubtedly had some very big questions to answer, but he stressed that intelligence gathering \u2014 for all nations \u2014 is an imperfect science.",
      "\"This type of terrorism has been, the elements of that, have been present in Australia for a long time, and our agencies spend a lot of time keeping an eye on them, but it's hard to track every single person,\" said Turnbull, who was Australian prime minister from 2015 to 2018.",
      "\"Certainly, it's a very big question: Why does somebody living in the suburbs of Sydney need six long arms, as he [Sajid Akram] had, even though they were licensed? Second question is, why were they licensed to a man who had a son who had been on an ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organization] watchlist because of links to ISIS-related entities? \u00a0\u2026 And that trip to the Philippines raises another question: Why were they there? And so, you know, this gets back to the problem that I think we face all around the world, is databases talking to each other? Are we actually putting all the dots together in time?\"",
      "\"There are holes in everybody's intelligence gathering,\" Turnbull said. \"But as you know, the terrorist only has to be right once. The security agencies have to be right every time.\"",
      "Regarding the sharp criticism levelled by many in the Jewish community, in particular, over perceived failings in detecting the threat posed by the suspects, and also in sufficiently protecting the pre-planned Jewish event on Bondi Beach, Turnbull said he wasn't sure how much more could have been done by his successor Albanese.",
      "\"I've been prime minister, right? And I'm on the opposite side of politics, so I'm not trying to be partisan about this, but I struggle to see what he could have done that was different. I mean there have been people saying he shouldn't have allowed pro-Palestine marches. Well, you know, we do have freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Australia. I mean we have restrictions in Australia on speech, on hate speech, and on guns, in particular.\"",
      "\"When I ask people, they will say he should have condemned antisemitism more often. Well, I've never heard him do anything other than condemn it, but my question really is to say, what would difference would that have made? To those terrorists, you know, they're not going to listen to a lecture on the evils of antisemitism from you or me or Anthony Albanese.\"",
      "\"Remember, terrorism is a political act, right? So, you've got to try to interrupt people being radicalized, particularly young men, it's the most vulnerable group, and that involves monitoring what is being said online, what they're being taught, you know, in schools or in mosques or in other places. And the intelligence agencies are doing that all the time,\" he said.",

      "President Trump on Tuesday called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela, as the administration heaps pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro at sea and leaves the door open for possible land strikes.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment. The Pentagon referred CBS News to the White House.",
      "Last week, the U.S. military seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News. Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump's Tuesday night announcement suggests that further seizures are possible. It's not clear how many vessels are covered by the planned blockade.",
      "The Maduro government called last week's boat seizure \"robbery\" and \"piracy.\" In a statement late Tuesday, Venezuela called the blockade a \"grotesque threat\" and a violation of international law, and accused the Trump administration of seeking to \"appropriate the oil, land and minerals of the country through gigantic campaigns of lies and manipulations.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes any future boat seizures are unlikely to lead to increases in global oil prices, he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0over the weekend. He didn't specify whether a total blockade was on the table, but said the administration is trying to crack down on a \"black market for oil.\"",
      "Venezuela is a major oil producer with some of the world's largest petroleum reserves. But its oil industry has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for years, with the Biden and Trump administrations citing human rights concerns and widespread allegations of fraud in Venezuela's last two elections.",
      "Heavily sanctioned oil producers like Venezuela, Russia and Iran have sought to export their oil despite the U.S. restrictions, in some cases allegedly turning to a global \"shadow fleet\" of older oil tankers with questionable registrations \u2014 a move that has\u00a0vexed\u00a0federal authorities.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he has ramped up economic pressure on Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of colluding with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has denied those allegations.",
      "Last week, the administration sanctioned six ships accused of carrying oil from Venezuela, along with three nephews of Maduro, two of whom were accused of narcotics trafficking and one of whom worked for the country's state oil company.",
      "Late Tuesday, Mr. Trump alleged in a social media post that the Maduro regime was using oil exports to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration has\u00a0taken steps to designate the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a loosely organized group it says is led by Maduro \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization. And Maduro himself faces a $50 million reward for his capture, after he was\u00a0charged with narco-trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "story": [
      "A missing woman's phone was found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness over the weekend, more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
      "An independent search party organized by Celine Cremer's friends and family found her phone on Saturday at a waterfall, Tasmania Police said in a statement. It was the first sign of Cremer ever located in the area where she went missing, aside from her car, which investigators discovered 10 days after the last confirmed sighting of her in Waratah, a town in the Australian island state of Tasmania.",
      "Tasmania Police said the phone will undergo further forensic examination and that they will now formally join the independent search for Cremer.",
      "Cremer, a Belgian woman, was last seen on June 17, 2023, in Waratah, according to police. Investigators believe that Cremer drove to Philosopher Falls, a waterfall surrounded by dense rainforest, and intended to set out for a short walk through the area.",
      "\"Unfortunately, she did not return,\" Tasmania Police inspector Andrew Hanson said in a statement.",
      "Her friends reported her disappearance to Tasmania Police on June 26, 2023, and the original search effort began the next day, police said.",
      "By then, the area had already experienced an intense spell of winter weather, including subzero temperatures, snow and rainfall. According to Hanson, medical experts at the time advised police that Cremer could not have survived so many days in the wilderness under those conditions.",
      "The initial search continued for two weeks, with no clues as to where Cremer might be, and follow-up searches over the years ended similarly. The recent discovery of Cremer's phone suggests that she may have veered off course during her walk around Philosopher Falls and lost her way.",
      "\"The phone was found in an area that has been extensively searched previously and phone data, as well as the location it was found, supports our theory that Celine may have, using an app on her phone, elected to leave the Philosopher Falls track to take more a direct route back to her car as daylight faded,\" said Hanson, adding: \"We suspect she dropped her phone and continued without it, becoming disoriented in dense terrain.\"",
      "A bout of harsh winter weather over the weekend postponed further search efforts, according to Tasmania Police, but Hanson said they planned to dispatch officers to the area as soon as those conditions cleared up.",
      "Police said that while they were not leading or coordinating the search that led to the phone's discovery, they \"had been supporting the effort by sharing information and advice about what to do should anything be discovered.\"",
      "The independent group of searchers included Cremer's friends and the adventure filmmaker Rob Parsons, who has posted videos of his own private attempts to search for Cremer on YouTube. He described the moment Cremer's phone was discovered in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "\"I don't think there was a dry eye in the area,\" Parsons told the news organization. \"Everyone was so emotional. Everything was building up to this point where her friends could be here for the discovery. It felt like it was meant to be.\"",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a \"very workable\" peace plan to end the war in Ukraine could be presented to Russia within days.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a peace deal to end his country's nearly four-year war with Russia are \"very workable\" and could be finalized within days, after which American envoys would present them to the Kremlin before further possible meetings in the United States next weekend.",
      "Zelenskyy warned late Monday that a draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin earlier in the day had not resolved some key issues, notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by invading Russian forces.",
      "U.S-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.",
      "If Ukraine seeks \"momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"We want peace - we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,\" he told reporters. \"We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.\"",
      "American officials on Monday said that there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. President Trump said, \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever\" to a peace settlement.",
      "Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, however.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either.",
      "\"The Americans are trying to find a compromise,\" Zelenskyy said before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. \"They are proposing a 'free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a 'free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The land issue remains one of the most difficult obstacles to a comprehensive agreement.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense. Kyiv would seek enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons if diplomacy collapses, he said.",
      "Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.",
      "U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks. \"We are at a major moment in this war. The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war,\" he said at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.",
      "Zelenskyy was also positive about the talks.",
      "\"Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,\" he said. \"It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking at the launch of the International Claims Commission for Ukraine in The Hague Tuesday, Zelenskyy added: \"As long as our people remain in Russian captivity and until the Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are brought home, sanctions must limit Russia, until it shows respect for peaceful for peaceful life and the rights of its neighbors. And of course, of course, every Russian war crime must have consequences for those who committed them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two suspected gunmen accused of killing 15 people and injuring dozens during a Hanukkah celebration in Australia have been identified as a father and a son, authorities said. The younger man was reportedly investigated years ago over suspected links to an ISIS cell in Sydney, and Australian officials confirmed Tuesday afternoon local time that two homemade ISIS flags were discovered in a vehicle registered to him.",
      "The shooting was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "The 50-year-old father, identified by police as Sajid Akram, was shot and killed by police, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the 24-year-old son remained hospitalized in a coma.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon has said, without going into further details.",
      "The 24-year-old suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, according to U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the investigation. CBS News has also reviewed Naveed Akram's New South Wales driver's license. Authorities said Sunday they had identified the father as a licensed gun owner.",
      "The officials had told CBS News that Naveed Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from. At the news conference on Tuesday local time, Lanyon also confirmed reports that the two alleged gunmen traveled to the Philippines last month. The exact location and purpose of the trip are under investigation, he said.",
      "Lanyon has said investigators recovered six of the suspect's licensed firearms at the scene. He initially said the older suspect had had a gun license for about 10 years, but confirmed Tuesday that the application lapsed in 2016. However, a second license was applied for in 2020 and eventually issued in 2023, meaning the older suspect was licensed appropriately at the time of the shooting, according to the police commissioner.",
      "The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon has said.",
      "In addition to two homemade ISIS flags found in Naveed Akram's vehicle, improvised explosive devices were also recovered, police said Tuesday.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" Lanyon said.",
      "Prime Minister Albanese confirmed that the younger suspect had been under investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Agency (ASIO), the country's primary spy agency, for about six months during 2019.",
      "According to public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp., ASIO looked into the son's possible ties to a cell of the ISIS terrorist organization in Sydney. Albanese didn't go into detail, but had said that ASIO had been focused on individuals believed to be in that cell who were associated with the son, rather than the son himself.",
      "\"He was examined on the basis of being associated with others, and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence,\" the prime minister said.",
      "During an earlier news conference, Australian police said they were looking for a potential third suspect, but Lanyon later confirmed that was no longer the case.",
      "More than 1,000 people were gathered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Sunday. Albanese said the gunmen were \"deliberately targeting the Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah.\"",
      "The attack at the popular beach left at least 40 people injured, including two officers and three children, Australian officials said.",
      "Also among the injured is 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, who had been shot after he confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled the weapon away, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "One video\u00a0posted to social media shows al Ahmed jump out from behind a parked car along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, tackle one of the suspects who had just fired his gun, and wrestle the weapon away.",
      "President Trump, during an event at the White House on Sunday, said al Ahmed's actions \"saved a lot of lives.\"",
      "Anna Schecter, Emily Mae Czachor, Archie Clarke and Sam Vinograd contributed to this report, which has been updated to reflect Australian authorities saying the younger suspect is Australian-born.\u00a0Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

    "summary": "The deadly terror attack at Bondi Beach in Sydney comes amid a significant spike in antisemitic rhetoric and attacks in Australia.",
    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 people had gathered on Bondi Beach on a warm day to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah in Australia. In stark contrast to the joyful energy on the beach, a terror plot was underway, allegedly planned in advance by a father and son who opened fire with rifles into the crowd, with an improvised explosive device at the ready in their car.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the younger suspect had been investigated by the country's primary intelligence agency in 2019 \u2014 reportedly over links to a suspected ISIS cell in Sydney \u2014   but that he was deemed to represent no security threat.",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians,\" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Sunday's mass shooting \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it was \"designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "Yet the two assailants were allegedly able to fire shots toward the beach for more than five minutes, according to eyewitness accounts. Videos show the gunmen taking their time to aim, shoot and then duck from a bridge near the beach. One video shows a good Samaritan jumping on the back of one of the shooters and wrestling his gun away. Local media reported that the man who intervened, identified as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, suffered two gunshot wounds.",
      "\"The first initial reaction wasn't even by police, it was by civilians, which raised a lot of questions about the role of police,\" said Oded Ailam, who worked in Israeli intelligence for two decades and reviewed videos of the attack for CBS News.",
      "Asked about police response time at a news conference Monday local time, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said, \"I respect a person having an opinion, but I've been really clear: Our police responded promptly. Our police respond very promptly. We work closely with the Jewish community. We are very attuned with providing support to the Jewish community.\"",
      "Ailam told CBS News, \"Everything points to this being a preplanned attack that was planned for a significant amount of time. The big question now is if Iran and Hezbollah will be implicated.\"",
      "Australia earlier this year determined a series of previous arson attacks targeting a synagogue and a Kosher food provider had been directed by Iran, and moved to cut diplomatic ties over the incidents.",
      "\"As a matter of principle, Iran condemns the violent attack against civilians in Sydney, Australia,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Sunday on social media. \"Terror violence and mass killing shall be condemned, wherever they're committed, as unlawful and criminal.\"",
      "When asked by reporters about whether Sunday's shooting was an intelligence failure, New South Wales officials waved off the questions and said their priority is keeping the community safe.",
      "The alleged assailants were a father and son duo. U.S. officials told CBS News on Sunday that they were from Pakistan, but Australian authorities later said the son was Australian-born, and they have not confirmed which country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "They had six firearms \u2014 purchased legally \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device to target the Jewish gathering, according to authorities.",
      "While shocking, the attack is not entirely surprising to people who track antisemitic attacks.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Australia has been plagued by reports of antisemitic attacks and incidents in the two years following Oct. 7, 2023, according to new figures from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "In one particularly notable incident last year, masked assailants conducted an arson attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. Seven months later an arsonist set fire to the doors of another Melbourne synagogue, the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, forcing the congregation to flee.",
      "Another arson attack was carried out at the kosher food provider Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney, also last year.",
      "The attacks on both the Adass Israel synagogue and the food company were determined by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to be tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. In August, Prime Minister Albanese expelled Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Sadeghi, and three other Iranian diplomats, citing the intelligence assessment concluding that Iran had directed antisemitic arson attacks on Australian soil.",
      "The ECAJ found antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number before Oct. 7, 2023, which is the largest spike of any J7 country between 2021 and 2024. J7 refers to the seven countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel that form the J7 Task Force Against Antisemitism: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Argentina and Australia.",
      "The J7 Task Force met in Sydney less than one week before Sunday's attack to discuss the growing security threat to the Jewish community in Australia.",
      "\"This attack is not only the latest in a disturbing series of antisemitic incidents in Australia but also around the globe, including in the United States,\" said Oren Segal, senior vice president of counter-extremism and intelligence at the Anti-Defamation League. \"And these incidents are becoming increasingly violent.\"",
      "This article has been updated to note that Australian authorities said the younger suspect is Australian-born. Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

    "story": [
      "An attack targeting a Jewish gathering at a famous Australian beach on Sunday killed at least 15 people, including a 12-year-old, government officials and police said. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including two officers and three children.",
      "Police said on Monday that two gunmen \u2014 a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son \u2014 had opened fire at Bondi Beach while the local Jewish community was celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. The 50-year-old gunman died, while his son was remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police. Police previously said the deceased gunman was the son, but Lanyon later clarified that the father was shot and killed by police.",
      "Officials had told CBS News on Sunday that Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "Albanese confirmed on Monday that Akram had been investigated for about six months during 2019 by the country's primary intelligence agency. National public broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the probe was over suspected links to an alleged ISIS cell in Sydney. Albanese said the investigation had determined that Akram posed no apparent threat to public safety.",
      "New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park said a 12-year-old child was among those killed in the attack. Three other children are being treated in the hospital, he said.",
      "\"This is absolutely horrendous for the community broadly, but particularly the Jewish community. ... What we saw last night was the worst of humanity, but at the same time, the very best of humanity,\" Park said.",
      "Officials have not identified the victims of the attack, although the international organization Chabad, which represents a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said that one of its rabbis, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah celebration where the shooting took place.",
      "Called Hanukkah by the Sea, the event was held to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday observed from sundown on Sunday until Monday, Dec. 22. More than 1,000 were at the beach when gunfire broke out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon. He called the attack a \"terrorist incident\" and said the perpetrators used \"long arms,\" referring to long guns such as shotguns or rifles, to carry it out.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Albanese also characterized the attack as targeted, with Minns saying it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\" The prime minister said it was \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\"",
      "\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations, and it is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,\" Albanese said during a news conference on Monday morning local time.",
      "Lanyon said police believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside a vehicle at Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, which they discovered shortly after the shooting occurred. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "International leaders have publicly condemned the attack.",
      "\"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Australia targeting a Jewish celebration,\" wrote U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in\u00a0a social media post. \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio's statement echoed others from officials in Israel, New Zealand, India, the United Kingdom and a number of European countries who similarly spoke out to denounce antisemitism and share their condolences after the shooting.",
      "King Charles also addressed the shooting in a statement, in which the monarch said he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack on Jewish people\" attending the Bondi Beach Hanukkah event.",
      "\"In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve,\" he said in the statement, adding that Australia's \"spirit of community and love ... will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.\"",
      "Gunman disarmed by bystander, video shows",
      "Images and video footage have emerged from the scene of the attack, showing the injured being wheeled away on stretchers by first responders.",
      "\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" said Albanese in a statement. \"My thoughts are with every person affected.\"",
      "One video appeared to show someone wrestling with one of the suspected gunmen and taking his weapon from him, according to Minns, who paid tribute to that individual in some of his comments Sunday.",
      "The video was recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. In it, a man jumped up from a crouched position behind a parked car and tackled the suspect, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "Following a short struggle, the man disarmed the suspect, pushed him to the ground and turned the weapon on him, at which point the suspect stood up and walked in the opposite direction. The man then lowered the weapon and raised his free hand in the air. Off to the side, one person appeared to be lying unresponsive on the sidewalk beside a different vehicle.",
      "In additional footage, which was also filmed by bystanders, crowds could be seen fleeing Bondi Beach as shots rang out in the background.",
      "Minns called the man, named by relatives to Australian media as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "Rare shooting",
      "Mass shootings in Australia are rare. But researchers have recorded dramatic upticks in antisemitic incidents in the country since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault by Hamas terrorists on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, along with spikes in hate incidents against Muslim groups.",
      "In response, the Australian government appointed special envoys last year to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in its communities. However, attacks have continued to happen since then. In July, an arsonist set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, another major Australian city, seven months after a different synagogue in the same city was burned by criminals in a blaze that injured one worshipper.",

      "One of the most widely known risks linked to the COVID-19 vaccine is myocarditis, especially in young males \u2014 and now a new Stanford study has shed some light on why this rare effect can occur.",
      "Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart, occurs in about one in 140,000 people who receive the first dose of the vaccine and one in 32,000 after the second dose, according to a Stanford press release. Among males 30 and younger, that rises to one in 16,750.",
      "Symptoms of the condition include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and palpitations, which can occur just one to three days after vaccination. Another marker is heightened levels of cardiac troponin, which indicates that the heart muscle has been damaged.",

      "In mouse and heart tissue models, high levels of these proteins led to signs of heart irritation, similar to mild myocarditis.",
      "Prevention mechanism",
      "\"One of the most striking findings was how much we could reduce heart damage in our models by specifically blocking these two cytokines, without shutting down the entire (desired) immune response to the vaccine,\" Wu told Fox News Digital, noting that a targeted, \"fine\u2011tuning\" immune approach might be enough to protect the heart.",
      "Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart, occurs in about one in 140,000 people who receive the first dose of the vaccine and one in 32,000 after the second dose. (iStock)",

      "ALWAYS RUNNING LATE? A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION COULD BE TO BLAME, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"For some people, it's personality-driven. They're distractible, optimistic about how long things take, or simply not tuned into the impact on others,\" the New York-based expert said.",
      "For others, the issue stems from neurobiological differences that affect how the brain manages time.",
      "Chronic lateness may not stem from poor planning, but from psychological and neurobiological factors. (iStock)",

      "For others, the struggle happens in the in-between moments. Shifting from one activity to another can feel surprisingly uncomfortable, so they linger longer than intended and lose time without noticing.",
      "Anxiety is a major factor behind why some people have trouble being on time, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Others may get caught up in the details, as perfectionism keeps them adjusting or \"fixing one more thing\" as the minutes slip away, Alpert said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Another major factor, the expert shared, is that many people simply misjudge how long tasks take. Their internal sense of time is often inaccurate, which leads them to assume they can fit far more into a day than is realistically possible.",
      "\u2018Time audit\u2019",

      "Views on the direction of the country are on a similar track, with 59% saying they are dissatisfied. That\u2019s a 9-point improvement from a year ago, when 68% were unhappy at the end of Biden\u2019s term. Meanwhile, 41% say they\u2019re satisfied, up from 31% in December 2024. The improvement is driven more by Republicans, whose satisfaction jumped 53 points, than by Democrats, whose satisfaction fell 32 points. Among independents, there is also an uptick (+8).",
      "Despite the current inflation rate being lower than the long-term average, fully 90% of voters are extremely or very concerned about inflation and high prices. That\u2019s the most in more than two years, and 61% are extremely concerned, up from 48% in June and the largest number in more than two years. About the same share is worried about healthcare prices (86% concerned, including 55% extremely concerned).",
      "That explains why the top three issues voters say the president should be paying more attention to right now are high prices (42%), healthcare (19%) and jobs (12%).",
      "And they think he should be paying less attention to immigration (30%), tariffs (28%) and foreign policy (17%).",

      "The issue both Democrats and Republicans say should be Trump\u2019s priority is high prices, and they also agree the next two issues should be healthcare (to varying degrees) and jobs.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s position is better than Biden\u2019s a year ago, but worse than his own in late 2017,\" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"The problem is voters haven\u2019t gotten used to a six-dollar box of cereal, and they don\u2019t think the president\u2019s policy initiatives \u2014 the One Big Beautiful Bill, and on tariffs and immigration \u2014 are addressing prices.\"",
      "Majorities are concerned about the country\u2019s political divisions (82%), the decline of moral values (75%), crime (74%), the federal deficit (71%), AI technology (63%) and climate change (58%). Concern about illegal immigration decreased from 67% in June to 57% in the new survey, while 66% say they are worried about ICE detentions and deportations.",
      "Democrats are nearly five times as likely as Republicans to say Trump should pay less attention to immigration, while three times as many Republicans as Democrats say foreign policy should be a lower priority. Roughly equal numbers in both parties think he should turn his attention away from tariffs. Tariffs are the issue on which Trump receives his lowest approval among all voters (36%) and among Republicans (72%).",
      "\u2013 In 2017, during Trump\u2019s first term, 62% of voters felt he was keeping his \"America First\" promise. Today, that\u2019s down to 49% who feel that way (51% say \"he abandoned that pledge\"). Most of the decline comes from a 20-point drop among Democrats and a 26-point drop among independents. Among Republicans, 91% said Trump was keeping his \"America First\" pledge in 2017 and 87% feel he is today.",
      "\u2013 While all administration members included in the survey have a net negative job rating, some fared better than others.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio received the best marks, with a net negative score of -5 points. Next, it\u2019s Vice President JD Vance, at -8, Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at -12 each, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at -13, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at -19. Among Republicans, approval hits 87% for Trump and 86% for Vance and Rubio, 80% for Noem, 78% for Hegseth and 77% for Kennedy. Approval among MAGA supporters is even higher: Trump 97%, Vance 94%, Rubio 92%, Noem 90%, Hegseth 88% and Kennedy 87%.",
      "\u2013 More than 6 in 10 voters disapprove of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Some 22% of Republicans disapprove of their party\u2019s lawmakers, while 34% of Democrats disapprove of theirs. Three quarters of independents disapprove of congressional Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\u2013 Around two-thirds of both parents and voters generally favor banning children under age 16 from using social media platforms as well as banning cellphones in K-12 classrooms. More Republicans favor the social media ban (73%) and cellphone ban (81%) than Democrats (56% and 59% respectively). Non-parents (71%) are more likely than parents (63%) to want cellphones out of school.",
      "\u2013 A 53% majority opposes the U.S. military using deadly force against presumed Venezuelan drug-trafficking boats, up from 47% last month. That 6-point increase in opposition comes from Democrats (+8 points), Republicans (+6), and independents (+4).",
      "\u2013 Most Republicans (84%) favor using the National Guard and U.S. military to assist local law enforcement in fighting crime in big cities, while most Democrats (87%) and more than half of independents (57%) oppose doing so. Overall, 47% of voters favor the action and 53% oppose it.",

This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions.

IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",

That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",

      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "How to buy the IRMO M1",
      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",
      "In 2022, LastPass confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed parts of its customer information through a third-party cloud storage service. While the incident initially raised alarms, the long-term impact has taken time to fully surface.",
      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",
      "Users have a right to expect that companies handling sensitive data take every reasonable step to protect it.",

    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking.

Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",
      "ADT HACKED: IS YOUR HOME SECURITY SYSTEM REALLY SECURE?",
      "Who actually tries to hack smart homes",
      "When hacking happens, it usually involves someone with some level of access already. In many cases, no technical hack occurs at all.",
      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",
      "Steps to stay safe in your smart home",
      "Strong habits and a few simple tools can block the most common threats that target connected homes.",
      "Choose long, complex passwords for your Wi-Fi router and smart home apps. A password manager makes this simple. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "Brands like Ring and Blink already use it. Add two-factor authentication (2FA) to every account that supports it.",
      "Removing your personal details from data broker sites helps prevent criminals from using leaked or scraped information to access your accounts or identify your home.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Pick smart home products from companies that explain how they protect your data and use modern encryption to lock down your footage and account details. Look for brands that publish clear security policies, offer regular updates and show how they keep your information private.",
      "Pick security cameras that let you save video directly to an SD card or a home hub, rather than uploading it to the cloud. This keeps your recordings under your control (and helps protect them if a company server is breached). Many cameras from trusted lines support local storage, so you do not have to rely on a company server.",
      "Install firmware updates quickly. Enable automatic updates when possible. Replace older gadgets that no longer receive patches.",
      "Your router is the front door to your smart home, so lock it down with a few simple tweaks. Use WPA3 encryption if your router supports it, rename the default network, and install firmware updates to patch security holes.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smart homes feel intimidating when scary headlines surface. But when you look at real-world data, you see far fewer risks than the stories suggest. Most attacks rely on weak passwords, poor router settings or old devices. With the right habits, your smart home can stay both convenient and secure.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "MIT\u2019s light-based scanner reads blood sugar through the skin without a single prick. (iStock)",
      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor. The accuracy seen in early testing shows that noninvasive tools are not a distant dream. They could help you catch swings in your levels faster and bring more comfort to a daily task that often feels overwhelming.",

      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information.

      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",

    "summary": "ChatGPT data breach exposes personal info of users through partner Mixpanel. OpenAI confirms names, emails compromised in security incident.",
    "story": [
      "'Outnumbered' panelists react to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's admission that he 'cannot imagine' raising his newborn son without help from ChatGPT.",
      "ChatGPT went from novelty to necessity in less than two years. It is now part of how you work, learn, write, code and search. OpenAI has said the service has roughly 800 million weekly active users, which puts it in the same weight class as the biggest consumer platforms in the world.",
      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",
      "Attackers can use leaked metadata to craft convincing phishing emails that look legitimate. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "PARENTS BLAME CHATGPT FOR SON\u2019S SUICIDE, LAWSUIT ALLEGES OPENAI WEAKENED SAFEGUARDS TWICE BEFORE TEEN\u2019S DEATH",
      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers know users panic when they hear about API limits, billing failures or account verification issues. If you get an email claiming to be from an AI provider, do not click the link. Open the site manually or use the official app to confirm whether the alert is real.",
      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain. With ChatGPT now approaching a billion weekly users, that chain needs tighter rules, better oversight and fewer blind spots. If anything, this should be a reminder that the rush toward AI adoption needs stronger policy guardrails. Companies cannot hide behind transparent emails after the fact. They need to prove that the tools you rely on every day are secure at every layer, including the ones you never see.",

      "Maxwell, the longtime associate and convicted accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein, filed the sweeping habeas motion pro se on Wednesday, arguing that \"newly discovered evidence\" proves she never received a fair trial. The 63-year-old is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her 2021 conviction on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges tied to Epstein\u2019s decades-long abuse network.",

Federal courts have previously ruled that the juror\u2019s error did not justify a new trial, but Maxwell argued new statements contradict earlier findings and warrant renewed scrutiny.",
      "Maxwell also challenged the authenticity of physical evidence used at trial, particularly the massage table introduced to establish the interstate commerce element of the charges. She claimed newly unsealed grand jury testimony conflicts with law enforcement accounts of how and where the table was seized and points to labeling and paperwork discrepancies that, she argues, raise questions about whether the exhibit shown to jurors was the same item recovered in the 2005 Palm Beach search.",

According to the filing, these lawyers worked closely with federal authorities, supplied investigative materials, communicated with witnesses and helped influence the development of the case before trial.",
      "The petition again raises Maxwell\u2019s long-standing argument that Epstein\u2019s 2007 non-prosecution agreement in Florida should have shielded her from federal charges.",
      "She claims newly surfaced internal documents show the agreement was intended to cover \"potential co-conspirators,\" including her, and asserts that prosecutors concealed drafts and communications that would have supported her position. Courts, however, have repeatedly rejected the argument that the Florida deal barred her prosecution in New York.",

      "At the Nov. 10 meeting, townspeople on both sides of the issue spoke to the board in person and via Zoom. Some supporters of the boy argued that he did not have a physical or biological advantage at his young age.

      "VIERA, Fla. \u2013 As federal investigators approach six weeks with no public updates in the homicide investigation of 18-year-old cheerleader Anna Kepner, a new round of subpoenas in Florida family court may offer a glimpse into the case.",
      "The subpoenas, filed by attorneys for Anna\u2019s stepmother, Shauntel Kepner, indicate that witnesses from both the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and Temple Christian School, where Anna was a student, were ordered to appear at a Wednesday afternoon custody hearing in Viera, Florida.",
      "The hearing began at 2:24 p.m. and finished at 3:38 p.m., ending without any major developments. Opening statements ran long, leaving time for testimony only from Shauntel's ex-husband, Thomas Hudson, and their 18-year-old son, Andrew Hudson.",
      "Inside the courtroom, tensions briefly flared as the custody dispute resumed. Thomas Hudson sat stiffly while his attorney revisited an alleged April 22, 2024, \"kidnapping\" incident involving Andrew \u2014 a flashpoint in Hudson\u2019s contempt allegations against Shauntel and her husband, Christopher Kepner. His attorney argued that problems in the family emerged \"when Chris Kepner came into the dynamic,\" and asked the court to award Hudson 140 days of make-up time for missed exchanges.",

      "When Andrew Hudson took the stand, his testimony remained largely unchanged from the previous hearing. Soft-spoken and cautious, he repeated his claims that his father never abused him or the younger children and that he never resisted court-ordered visitation.",
      "When asked about a 2025 confrontation involving Shauntel and Christopher, Andrew again said he \"blacked out,\" offering little new detail. The judge blocked an attempt to introduce photos tied to abuse allegations, deeming them irrelevant.",
      "Andrew added that recent visits with his younger siblings were uneventful, and under cross-examination, acknowledged he has had almost no contact with Shauntel since 2023 aside from a few brief calls.",
      "No testimony Wednesday touched on the day of the cruise, the stateroom where Anna was found, or the FBI\u2019s ongoing homicide investigation. With no resolution reached, the court indicated another hearing would be scheduled at a later date.",
      "The latest activity comes as federal authorities continue to investigate Anna\u2019s death aboard the Carnival Horizon on Nov. 7, after she was found under the bed in her stateroom she shared with her 14-year-old brother and 16-year-old stepbrother. Her death has been ruled a homicide by mechanical asphyxia.",
      "Criminal defense attorney and Fox News Contributor Donna Rotunno previously told Fox News Digital that the silence from investigators may reflect the complexity of a case if the potential perpetrator\u2019s family live under the same roof.",
      "\"It is odd we haven\u2019t heard anything,\" Rotunno said. \"But I think there\u2019s a reason for it. When you\u2019re dealing with essentially one family, authorities have to be careful about what they put out there. You don\u2019t want to tip off what\u2019s going on when your victim\u2019s family and your perpetrator\u2019s family are in the same house.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. limits on Venezuelan oil exports are cutting the revenue that once sustained Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, weakening his cash flow and putting the regime\u2019s stability at risk.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior correspondent Rich Edson joins \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 with details on President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming national address and his move to designate Nicolas Maduro's regime as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "For years, Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has defied predictions of collapse. Sanctions, diplomatic isolation and internal unrest have failed to unseat him. But the latest escalation by the Trump administration \u2014 including the seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker and the enforcement of a blockade on sanctioned vessels \u2014 has hit the regime where it is most vulnerable: its oil trade.",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that while the timeline and outcome remain uncertain, the regime\u2019s dependence on oil leaves it uniquely vulnerable. \"One thing is clear: the Maduro regime can\u2019t sustain itself without oil revenue,\" she said.",
      "While the U.S. move has raised concerns among European allies, who warned that the escalation could undermine regional stability and complicate efforts toward a political resolution in Venezuela, Ford Maldonado says the administration\u2019s approach is striking at the core of Maduro\u2019s power.",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing now with President Trump\u2019s order for a total blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela is a direct hit against Maduro\u2019s revenue streams,\" she said. \"He needs the oil money from these tankers to buy loyalty and pay off generals, cartel partners and political enforcers to stay in power. That pipeline is finally being cut.\"",
      "MADURO SINGS, DANCES AND THREATENS TO 'SMASH THE TEETH' OF THE 'NORTH AMERICAN EMPIRE'",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was questioned about the U.S. seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. (Planet Labs PBC/Handout via Reuters\u00a0)",
      "According to Reuters, up to 11 million barrels of Venezuelan crude are currently stranded aboard 39 tankers anchored offshore.",
      "Jorge Jraissati, president of the Economic Inclusion Group, said the recent U.S. actions \"fundamentally change the economics of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports.",
      "\"That oil is neither sold nor paid for,\" Jraissati said. \"Until those cargoes move, they generate no cash flow for PDVSA and deepen Maduro\u2019s liquidity strain.\" PDVSA is Venezuela's state-run oil company.",
      "Venezuela is one of the most oil-dependent countries on earth. Oil accounts for more than 80% of exports and roughly 90% of government revenue, leaving the nation extraordinarily exposed when crude shipments falter.",
      "\"After years of economic collapse as a result of Venezuela\u2019s socialist policies, virtually all other sectors of the economy are bankrupted,\" Jraissati noted.",

      "U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil have been in place since 2019, but enforcement often lagged, and PDVSA continued to move crude through intermediaries and opaque trading networks, mainly toward Asia. The recent tanker seizure appears to have changed that dynamic.",
      "The Trump administration said the seized vessel was headed for Cuba, but Jraissati argued China was the more likely destination. \"Tankers of that size are typically deployed on long-haul routes, and China accounts for roughly 60% percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports,\" he said.",
      "Not only has crude become harder to sell, it has become cheaper. Venezuelan heavy crude is trading at discounts of up to $21 per barrel below Brent, according to sources cited by Jraissati and confirmed by Reuters reporting.",

      "\"The seizure is already reshaping Venezuela\u2019s oil trade,\" he said. \"PDVSA is facing stuck cargoes, rising price discounts and new demands from buyers to renegotiate spot contracts.\"",
      "Oil tankers, with cargoes worth tens of millions of dollars, now face heightened risk if they enter Venezuelan waters. This has sent buyers and shipowners scrambling for insurance and new terms.",
      "\"In general terms, this is a game-changing policy because it fundamentally alters the economics of exporting oil from Venezuela,\" Jraissati said. \"Exports will not stop, but the conditions under which they are sold will deteriorate sharply. It will weaken Maduro\u2019s cash flow.\"",

      "For years, Venezuela has used a \"shadow\" or \"dark\" fleet \u2014 vessels that turn off tracking systems, swap names and switch flags \u2014 to move crude around sanctions. Jraissati said this network of ships tries to obscure ownership through shell companies and frequent reflagging.",

      "\"80% of people in Venezuela are in poverty,\" he said. \"50% are in extreme poverty, meaning they don\u2019t make even $3 a day.\"",
      "He added that more than 30% of the population \u2014 around 8 million people \u2014 have left the country amid the ongoing crisis.",
      "Jraissati cautioned that oil pressure alone will not topple Maduro, but described the current combination of sanctions, seizures and diplomatic isolation as unprecedented.",
      "\"This needs to be seen as a combination of actions. Oil pressure alone is not enough. Diplomatic pressure alone is not enough. But when all of these are combined, there is a much greater possibility of Maduro actually falling,\" he said.",

      "\"Regimes like Maduro\u2019s display little concern about the impact of sanctions on their own people, and when traditional sources of income dry up, they seek other lifelines, as Maduro has with narcotics and other forms of illicit finance,\" Brown said.",
      "Still, Brown said Washington\u2019s strategy reflects broader security concerns, drug and human trafficking and hostile foreign influence in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "\"President Trump is right to identify Venezuela as ground zero for many of the problems we are concerned with in the Western Hemisphere,\" Brown said.",
      "Maduro has survived sanctions, protests and isolation before. But analysts say the current oil crackdown directly threatens the regime\u2019s ability to pay security forces, maintain patronage networks and keep the state functioning.",

      "\"It\u2019s very important that we continue to emphasize that Venezuela\u2019s oil does not belong to Maduro or his cronies,\" Ford Maldonado said, \"It belongs to the Venezuelan people who made their choices clear at the ballot box last year and have been robbed blind by the regime which continues to enrich itself and hijack the country\u2019s primary economic lifeline to stay in power. Cutting off that cash is the fastest way to weaken the regime, and weakening the regime helps the Venezuelan people!\"",

Guterres said such unilateral actions risk deepening divisions, hardening positions and accelerating fragmentation, with potential spillover effects on regional security, including the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa.",
      "Bridget Toomey, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that for the U.S. to support southern secession would be \"at odds with the stated policy of the internationally recognized government of Yemen, which currently exists for one Yemen.\" She said the United States supports that government, but added that backing the STC as a partner in counterterrorism missions and in the fight against the Houthis \"would not necessarily be at odds with the government,\" particularly because the STC and its leadership are part of the current governing framework.",
      "Country split in two",
      "Yemen\u2019s war has long divided the nation. In the north, the Houthis rule Sanaa and much of western Yemen with support from Iran and ties to Hezbollah. In the south, STC-aligned forces dominate Aden, the temporary capital, and a belt of inland and coastal regions that include Lahj, Abyan, Shabwa, Hadramout and al-Mahra.",
      "The internationally recognized Yemeni government, which the United States continues to support, is formally based in Aden but remains fragmented. The Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council serves as the recognized authority and has relied heavily on a coalition of competing factions, including the STC, to govern and confront the Houthis and to maintain control on the ground.",
      "Toomey said, \"The government has faced serious economic, oversight and capacity challenges and has struggled to deliver basic services, a situation compounded by the ongoing fight against the Houthis and Yemen\u2019s broader humanitarian crisis.\"",

      "That reliance has drawn criticism. Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government has accused STC-affiliated forces of carrying out deadly attacks in Hadramout and warned that the group\u2019s recent expansion risks sparking conflict between rival factions within the anti-Houthi camp. The Associated Press reported that Yemeni officials urged the STC to withdraw from areas seized in the east, cautioning that unilateral moves could undermine the political process and destabilize a fragile balance in the south.",
      "Atef rejected that characterization, describing the Hadramout operation as a major success that demonstrated the STC\u2019s ability to fight what he called hostile forces operating in coordination with the Houthis. He accused those forces of collaborating with \"Houthi terrorists\" and said the STC\u2019s actions strengthened security rather than undermined it.",

      "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discusses the threat of Islamic terrorism, the fallout from the Hanukkah terror attack in Australia, and more on \u2018Fox & Friends.\u2019",
      "FIRST ON FOX: Senior Israeli intelligence officials say warnings delivered to Australia ahead of a deadly attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach were part of a much broader alert: an accelerating global rise in attempts to execute terror attacks across Western countries, increasingly aimed not only at Jewish targets, but also at Christians and large gatherings especially during religious holidays.",
      "According to a senior Israeli intelligence official, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence service has been tracking a sharp increase in attempted attacks worldwide, many of them low-tech, quickly mobilized and designed to exploit open societies and crowded public events.",
      "\"We stopped a few ticking bombs, the target was on people\u2019s heads,\" the senior official told Fox News Digital.",

      "People attend a floral memorial in honour of the victims of a mass shooting that targeted a Hanukkah celebration on Sunday, at Bondi Beach, in Sydney, Australia, Dec. 16, 2025. (Flavio Brancaleone/Reuters)",
      "Israeli intelligence officials say Australia is not an outlier. From their perspective, recent months have revealed a pattern of attempted and disrupted plots across Europe, North America and beyond, pointing to a sustained global threat rather than sporadic violence.",
      "\"If you knew how many terror attacks we exposed and prevented,\" the senior official said, \"your jaw would drop.\"",
      "Israeli intelligence officials say the rise in attempted attacks is driven in part by how extremist and state-linked networks build terror infrastructure globally while deliberately masking their origins.",
      "Officials say the networks frequently rely on non-Iranian nationals to carry out different roles along the operational chain, including logistics, intelligence gathering, financing and execution, in order to blur any connection to Tehran. In some cases, operatives are recruited from migrant or refugee backgrounds, while in others criminal elements or hired proxies are used to carry out acts of violence.",
      "People gather around a tribute for shooting victims outside the Bondi Pavilion at Sydney's Bondi Beach, Monday, Dec. 15, 2025, a day after the shooting. (Mark Baker/AP Photo)",
      "To avoid detection, officials say the networks rely on encrypted communications and clandestine in-person meetings, sometimes conducted outside the country where an attack is planned. In other cases, instructions are delivered remotely through secure channels that bypass standard telecommunications monitoring.",
      "According to Israeli assessments, extremist networks are increasingly overlapping: jihadist ideology, lone-actor violence and state-linked activity now exist in the same ecosystem, fueled by online radicalization and geopolitical instability. Many plots, officials say, are unsophisticated, making them harder to detect early while still capable of causing mass casualties.",

      "Israeli intelligence officials and foreign diplomatic sources warn that the threat is not limited to Jewish targets and is global. \"We exposed terror cells in Germany, Greece, Austria \u2014 but not only Europe \u2014 also in South America, India and Thailand.\" The senior official said he cannot elaborate further.",
      "A senior foreign diplomatic source said the current environment is being shaped by what they described as a global contagion effect, in which attacks are amplified online, celebrated across extremist networks and rapidly imitated elsewhere.",
      "According to the source, attacks are increasingly attractive to extremists because they are relatively easy to carry out while producing outsized psychological and political impact.",

      "The source cautioned that Christian communities and broader civilian gatherings are also vulnerable, particularly during religious holidays and symbolic events that attract large crowds.",
      "This concern has been reflected across Europe in recent weeks, when authorities sharply increased security at Christmas markets and holiday celebrations amid warnings that seasonal events present prime targets for extremist violence. Armed patrols, barriers and surveillance were expanded in multiple cities as officials assessed elevated risks tied to jihadist-inspired attacks and lone actors.",
      "On Monday, federal authorities announced they foiled a New Year\u2019s Eve terror plot, arresting suspects accused of planning coordinated attacks involving improvised explosive devices, according to the Department of Justice. Prosecutors said the plot was disrupted before explosives were fully assembled, underscoring both the scale of the threat and the importance of early intelligence intervention.",
      "A second senior Israeli intelligence source said the broader threat environment has deteriorated after two years of war in the Middle East, which they said has energized radical Islamist movements globally.",
      "According to the source, instability in Syria is of particular concern, creating conditions that could allow ISIS to regroup and once again project influence beyond the region.",
      "\"I\u2019m worried about Syria and that ISIS will return,\" the source said, warning that renewed activity there could inspire further attacks in Europe, Australia and North America.",

      "The source said the growing prevalence of lone actors and sleeper cells poses a significant challenge to Western security services, as individuals with minimal resources can still carry out deadly attacks and trigger copycat violence.",
      "While Australian authorities have not linked the Bondi Beach attack to foreign intelligence direction, Israeli officials say the case fits into a wider global picture: a sustained rise in attempted terror attacks, many of which never become public because they are disrupted early.",

      "Senior Israeli intelligence officials say Australia was warned months in advance about the establishment of foreign-linked terror infrastructure on its soil, including activity aimed at Jewish communities, amid growing concerns about both Iranian-directed operations and a potential resurgence of ISIS in Syria.",
      "According to a senior Israeli intelligence official who spoke on background with Fox News Digital, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence service provided Australian authorities with concrete warnings about what the official described as Iranian-directed terror activity operating inside Australia. The warning, the official said, was not about the Bondi Beach attack specifically, but about broader efforts to build terror networks with the intent of harming Jewish targets.",

      "After the shooting, Iranian state media published an official condemnation of the attack, denouncing the killing of civilians and rejecting any connection between Iran and the violence. Australian officials said the investigation into the attack remains ongoing and have not attributed it to a foreign state. An intelligence source said we will know in the next few days if there has been such guidance.",
      "The Israeli intelligence assessments align with warnings from a senior foreign diplomatic source, who described the current threat environment as being driven by a global contagion effect, in which extremist networks worldwide amplify and celebrate attacks, encouraging others to replicate them.",
      "According to the diplomatic source, online jihadist ecosystems play a central role in accelerating this dynamic, rapidly turning incitement into action. From an operational standpoint, the source said such attacks are increasingly attractive to extremists because they are relatively simple to carry out while producing disproportionate impact.",

      "\u201cNobody arrives at surrogacy having had an easy go of it. Everybody comes here having had difficulties and losses,\u201d she said. \u201cI was able to call her cellphone when I had questions, and she was available \u2014 until suddenly she wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "That personal connection made Hall-Greenberg\u2019s recent actions especially hurtful, she added: \u201cWe weren\u2019t just faceless names or numbers on a ledger. She knew us. She knew our stories.\u201d",
      "Shaffer, who counted Hall-Greenberg as a friend as well as a boss, said she feels dumbfounded and betrayed. \u201cIt was all about connection and building bonds and having this close-knit relationship with these intended parents and surrogates,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what she preached.\u201d",
      "Surro Connections is not the first surrogacy-related firm to be rocked by a scandal: In the last three years, there have been at least four instances in which keepers of surrogacy-related escrow accounts stole funds from hopeful parents.",
      "Most of those cases involved external escrow managers that held money for surrogacy agencies. Even so, the Society for Ethics in Egg Donation and Surrogacy, a nonprofit that releases standards for surrogacy and egg donation, still advises that a third party hold the escrow to protect intended parents and surrogates.",
      "At Surro Connections, however, Hall-Greenberg used those scandals to persuade would-be parents to keep their escrow funds in-house, clients said.",
      "She assured them that the funds were kept separate and housed at a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  according to an email viewed by NBC News. Invoices and receipts were supposed to be loaded onto a shared folder that the intended parents could access. When parents or surrogates pushed back on the in-house system, Hall-Greenberg would often insist, multiple people said.",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, it seems like it\u2019s kind of a red flag that it was an in-house escrow situation, but they had sort of sold it as, \u2018You get to save money with us,\u2019\u201d Klaveno said, given that the one-stop shop approach avoided some third-party fees.",
      "There were other red flags, too.",
      "Alexis Lytle, 27, a surrogate based in Indiana, said payments were sometimes late, prompting her to reach out to ask when they\u2019d be deposited",
      "\u201cI just figured, \u2018It\u2019s an agency, they\u2019re busy,\u2019\u201d said Lytle, who is 19 weeks pregnant.",
      "She said her intended parents have assured her they\u2019ll continue to support her, despite them losing about $40,000.",
      "Public records suggest that Hall-Greenberg may have been experiencing financial strain.",
      "Last year, she sold several cheerleading gyms that she had owned across Oregon and Washington. Between that business and Surro Connections, she owes Oregon more than $84,000 in unpaid taxes, according to the latest records from its Revenue Department.",
      "Filings also show that Hall-Greenberg took out at least four loans over the past five years to support her businesses. In September, she sold a lender a percentage of Surro Connections\u2019 future revenue for $15,000. The lender sued weeks later, accusing her of defaulting on the agreement, then discontinued the case in October for unspecified reasons.",
      "The same month, a court ordered Hall-Greenberg to pay American Express over $70,000 that she owed in credit card debt. Less than six months prior, she had been ordered to pay the company more than $30,000.",
      "\u2018It seemed unreal\u2019",
      "When payments to surrogates were late last month, Shaffer said, Hall-Greenberg told her it was an honest mistake \u2014 a result of extra work because an employee had been out of the office.",
      "\u201cI gave her the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said Shaffer, who had worked for the agency for six years. From her perspective, business seemed good \u2014 she said she was offered a raise about a month ago.",
      "After many payments didn\u2019t go out as planned again in December, calls and complaints began to pour in, Shaffer said. But Hall-Greenberg asked Shaffer to clear her schedule, then stopped responding to employees and clients altogether. Christopher Foster, the owner of a neighboring business, said he heard the agency\u2019s phone ringing off the hook for about 10 hours Dec. 5.",
      "By the time the FBI searched the office, it appeared to have been cleared out, according to Foster, who was on site at the time.",
      "\u201cThere were empty binders everywhere. Bags of shredded files \u2026 computers are all gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Kama Stauffer, 34, a first-time surrogate from Ashland, Ohio, said she received her payment this month but found out about the problems at Surro Connections through a Facebook group. Stauffer is nine weeks pregnant.",
      "She estimates her intended parents lost about $50,000.",
      "\u201cIt seemed unreal. It seemed impossible that an agency could basically implode overnight with no notice,\u201d  Stauffer said.",
      "Several former Surro Connections employees have been working to connect clients and surrogates to other agencies and organizations, which have in turn stepped up to help, with some offering pro bono services. But many intended parents are still struggling to process the scale of their losses and figure out how to move forward.",
      "Klaveno doubts she\u2019ll ever recoup her money, but worse is that Hall-Greenberg knew what that money represented, she said.",
      "\u201cIt was the hope. It was the dream of building a family, and in some cases, maybe the only hope of doing that,\u201d Klaveno said, \u201cand she knew that.\u201d"

      "As measles continues to spread in the United States, it\u2019s likely that the outbreaks that broke records in 2025 will continue into the new year.",
      "In South Carolina, 168 people, mostly schoolchildren, are in quarantine. Most of the state's 138 cases confirmed since September, nearly all in unvaccinated people, have been centered in Spartanburg County in the northwestern part of the state.",
      "\u201cAs we identify new cases, and if those cases have susceptible contacts, that\u2019s a new 21-day quarantine period,\u201d Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the state Department of Public Health, said Wednesday at what has become a weekly news briefing.",
      "That is, anyone who is unvaccinated and therefore vulnerable to measles exposures occurring now will be in quarantine through the holidays.",
      "According to NBC News data, the K-12 vaccination rate for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak.",
      "Bell said the vaccination rate has been falling for several years, similar to other areas in the United States.",
      "Based on NBC News' investigation, The Vaccine Divide, in the states collecting data for the MMR vaccine, 67% of counties and jurisdictions have immunization rates below 95%.",
      "Bell said at the briefing that there was no indication the South Carolina outbreak was spreading yet to nearby states, such as North Carolina.",
      "Since the latest surge in cases, which began in late summer in the bordering areas of southwestern Utah and Arizona and, more recently, in South Carolina, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has taken a low profile, with nearly all public outreach about the nationwide outbreaks coming from local and state health departments.",
      "It\u2019s a stark contrast to how the agency has previously communicated about infectious diseases like measles.",
      "A study published last week uncovered an \u201cemerging health communication void\u201d regarding measles and measles vaccines in the CDC\u2019s social media accounts. The agency posted about measles 10 times on its social media channels from January through August, according to the study.",
      "During the same period from 2021 to 2024, the CDC posted an average of about 46 times each year, the study found.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services (which oversees the CDC), said in an email that the \u201cCDC has developed and distributed updated communication materials, including multilingual resources, to help communities respond to ongoing outbreaks.\u201d",
      "The CDC sends teams to investigate infectious disease hot spots only if states request it. Bell said the South Carolina Public Health Department hasn\u2019t asked for extra help from the agency to contain the outbreak.",
      "Separately, the measles outbreak largely straddling the border between Arizona and Utah also continues to swell.",
      "The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reports 125 cases, with 21 diagnosed just in the last three weeks. According to the health department, there were multiple measles exposures last week in the southwestern part of the state, including at an elementary school, an urgent care facility, a pediatrician\u2019s office and a pediatric dentistry.",
      "The Arizona Department of Health Services reports 190 cases, nearly all in Mohave County, which borders Utah.",
      "Nearly all of those cases, 97%, occurred among people who weren\u2019t vaccinated against the virus.",
      "As of Wednesday, the United States had logged 1,958 measles cases in 2025, according to the latest update from the CDC. That\u2019s just 168 cases shy of a previous high of 2,216 recorded in 1992.",
      "There have been 49 outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) reported in 2025. In 2025, 222 people, 11% of the 1,958 cases, were sick enough to be hospitalized, according to the CDC.",
      "Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two young girls in Texas, have died."

      "This article was published in partnership with Bloomberg Law.",

      "Officials in Congress and in states from Pennsylvania to California said they were alarmed by a Bloomberg Law/NBC News investigation detailing systemic failures that allow vulnerable women to give birth in jail cells \u2014 sometimes with deadly results.",
      "The proposals aim to keep pregnant women out of jail, monitor the cases of those who do get locked up, and get them proper health care.",
      "\u201cThe allegations are really, truly, gutting,\u201d said Pennsylvania state Sen. Amanda Cappelletti, a Democrat, who is proposing legislation in her state after reading the investigation.",
      "Bloomberg Law and NBC News found more than 50 women across the U.S. who said they endured horrific endings to their pregnancies while in jail. The accounts included miscarriages, stillbirths and delivering babies who lived only days. Most of the women were locked up for petty crimes and held because they could not pay bail fees as low as $125. Some gave birth alone on jail cell toilets or bled for days before they received proper health care. Two pregnant women died in their cells.",
      "In three cases in Pennsylvania, women said they endured dangerous pregnancy complications without adequate medical care.",
      "Cappelletti said the issue is \u201cvery personal.\u201d She has suffered three miscarriages and is expecting her second child in the spring.",
      "\u201cYou think about what those poor individuals went through and the state of mind that they must be in even today,\u201d she said.",
      "She is writing a bill that would allow pregnant women accused of nonviolent offenses to stay out of jail while they await trial.",
      "Keeping pregnant women out of jail is what women\u2019s health advocates and some law enforcement officials say is the clearest solution to the problem. While some states have taken steps in this direction, such reforms remain rare. How often pregnant women are jailed is unknown because the government does not comprehensively track pregnancies in local jails. There is no nationwide requirement that jails track when detainees are pregnant \u2014 or report when a baby dies after being born behind bars. At least 22 states don\u2019t track pregnancy outcomes in jail, the investigation found.",
      "\u201cWe need to encourage life and help promote life, so this is a good reminder for all of us that even for women who are incarcerated we should make sure the circumstances they find themselves in are positive,\u201d said Kentucky state Sen. Julie Raque Adams, a Republican who has sponsored measures that sought to improve the treatment of incarcerated pregnant women.",
      "An attempt to close the gap is underway in Congress, where Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., has been trying since 2023 to pass a bill to improve health care for incarcerated women. She plans to introduce a new version of her Pregnant Women in Custody Act next month.",
      "The bill would require the federal government to collect data on pregnancies in jails, evaluate local and state policies and teach corrections staff about the risks faced by pregnant detainees and prisoners. It would also require the federal Bureau of Prisons to provide special care to pregnant inmates and curtail the use of restrictive housing at federal facilities and immigration detention centers.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re in the custody of the government, and we have a responsibility to make sure people aren\u2019t leaving our care in worse shape than when they came in,\u201d Kamlager-Dove said. \u201cThere is no reason I should ever read a story about a baby who was born in a toilet of a jail cell.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article includes descriptions of self-harm.",
      "The families of two teenage boys who died by suicide filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Meta, alleging that the tech company has ignored the rising danger of sexual blackmail schemes targeting teens on Instagram.",
      "The families, who are from Pennsylvania and Scotland, said in the lawsuit that their boys fell victim to the same type of \u201csextortion\u201d scam thousands of miles apart: A stranger contacts a teen on Instagram pretending to be a romantic interest, solicits nude or intimate photos and then threatens to share the images with friends and family unless the teen shares more or pays an extortion fee.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest attempt to hold Instagram accountable for what some users say are lethal scams that take place on its platform. Meta, which owns Instagram, is facing at least four other sextortion-related lawsuits that claim that Instagram is a defective product and has been negligent by not dealing with a sextortion problem for years.",
      "The lawyers behind the latest suit said they plan to draw on a newly available trove of internal corporate records from Meta to bolster their case.",
      "\u201cThis was known,\u201d Matthew Bergman, the families\u2019 lead lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThis was not an accident. This was not a coincidence. This was a foreseeable consequence of the deliberate design decisions that Meta made. Their own documents show that they were very aware of this extortion phenomenon, and they simply chose to put their profits over the safety of young people.\u201d",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Meta did not directly address the claims in the lawsuit but said it was working to fight sextortion scammers.",
      "\u201cSextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it, and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts,\u201d the company said.",
      "Meta said that, since 2021, it has placed teens younger than 16 into private accounts when they sign up for Instagram, although the lawsuit disputes that and says the company did not automatically do so until 2024.",
      "Meta added in its statement: \u201cWe work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behavior from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them. We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they\u2019re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.\u201d",
      "While Instagram has instituted some design changes for minors in recent years to attempt to address extortion, the lawsuit argues that the changes came too late and that Instagram should be held responsible for the two teens\u2019 deaths.",
      "Teenagers\u2019 treatment at the hands of social media companies \u2014 and of Instagram in particular \u2014 has become a major flashpoint in society. A movement has sprung up of parents who say Instagram and other apps contributed to their children\u2019s suicides or exploitation, and members of Congress are investigating Meta\u2019s AI chatbots over child safety concerns. Last year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told parents who were in the audience at a Senate hearing on child online safety that he was \u201csorry for everything that you have all gone through\u201d and that Meta would \u201ccontinue doing industry-leading efforts to make sure that no one has to go through the types of things that your families have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "This month, Australia became the first country to ban people under 16 from social media.",
      "The lawsuit stems from two deaths: Levi Maciejewski, from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, who died last year at age 13; and Murray Dowey, from Dunblane, Scotland, who died in 2023 at 16.",
      "Tricia Maciejewski, Levi\u2019s mother, said in an interview that, until his death, she did not think it would be possible for a total stranger to be able to message a teenager on Instagram."

      "After Soph found an advantage in the jungle to help her in the Immunity Challenge, she learned from Probst at the challenge that half of her puzzle pieces were already placed in the correct spots. But Soph instantly fell behind during the first portion of the challenge and struggled to crawl through the mud.",
      "Meanwhile, Savannah sped through nearly every portion and quickly completed the puzzle, giving her a record-tying fourth Immunity Challenge win and guaranteeing her a spot in the final four.  She also won the reward and chose to take Sage to the Sanctuary to enjoy steak and potatoes.",
      "In her confessional, Savannah smiled wide as she celebrated her win and pointed out how she has been able to outlast her foes all season long.",
      "1st Tribal Council",
      "Back at camp, Kristina \u2014 who assumed Savannah, Soph and Rizo would vote together given that they've been a strong trio for most of the game \u2014 pitched voting out Sage to Soph and Rizo. During the reward meal, Sage suggested to Savannah that the better move was to vote out Kristina since she could beat anyone in the Fire-Making Challenge. Thus, the Tres Leches alliance was at a stalemate going into Tribal Council.",
      "After a back-and-forth between Kristina and Sage at Tribal Council where they both explained why the other was a threat, it was time to vote. Rizo \u2014 who had been holding onto his Hidden Immunity Idol for a record nine Tribal Councils \u2014 finally played his idol for himself before the votes were read.",
      "Probst read the votes and revealed Kristina as the 14th person voted out and seventh member of the jury.",
      "2nd Immunity Challenge",
      "Following an interruption due to an address from President Trump, the show picked up at the second and final Immunity Challenge of the night.",
      "The final four were neck and neck as they reached the final portion of the challenge. Soph pulled out a comeback victory and received her first Immunity Challenge win of the season.",
      "\"Oh my God, this is a dream!\" she said when Probst placed the necklace around her neck.",
      "Fire-Making Challenge",
      "As the winner, Soph had to choose which person to take to the end with her and which two castaways had to face off in the Fire-Making Challenge. She told the other three that they should practice while she contemplated her decision, adding that she didn't want them to plead their cases.",
      "In a confessional, Savannah said she felt betrayed by her \"best friend\" Soph for not instantly wanting to save her. Rizo tried to remain optimistic and said he had more experience making fire compared to Savannah and Sage. Sage also had a positive mentality as she prepared, telling herself that whatever was meant to happen would happen.",
      "At Tribal Council, Probst said Soph's choice could be a $1 million decision. She announced that she wanted to take Sage to the final three and have her two allies, Savannah and Rizo, make fire to earn the last spot.",
      "While Rizo struggled and repeatedly smothered his fire, Savannah nurtured a strong fire that continued to grow until it burned through the rope, making her the winner.",
      "Rizo became the eighth and final member of the jury. Before leaving, Rizo shared some emotional departing words. \"For a little Albanian boy from New York City... to say I have no regrets, to say I made my family proud, to say I made a whole country proud, I truly feel like I left an impact on this game.\"",
      "He asked to be called by his nickname, \"Riz God,\" as Probst snuffed his torch.",
      "Final Tribal Council",
      "As their final breakfast arrived at camp, Savannah, Sage and Soph reflected on being the first all-female final three in 20 seasons. They also shared some of their favorite moments with each member of the jury.",
      "Next, it was time for Final Tribal Council to begin. Rizo kicked things off by sharing kind words for the three ladies. The remaining members of the jury then posed questions that allowed each finalist to elaborate on their strategies and how they outwitted, outlasted and outplayed everyone else.",
      "When asked to name her most strategic move, Soph said she built strong connections outside of her trio that helped her social game. Savannah recalled a conversation with jury member Sophie Segreti where she pitched working together. Sage mentioned her move to vote out Sophie over Savannah.",
      "For their final pitches, Soph noted that she had been to 12 Tribal Councils and voted out more people than anyone else. Savannah said she successfully dodged the most bullets because she was adaptable, prioritized key relationships and dominated in Immunity Challenges. Sage said she had an important social component to her game that worked hand in hand with her strategic game, allowing her to build close friendships.",
      "And the Winner Is\u2026",
      "\"The jury has made their decision. I'll read the votes,\" Probst said. After three votes were revealed, each woman had a vote each. But as he continued to read the votes, Savannah's name appeared again and again. Savannah was crowned the winner of Season 49.",

He told us stories about the strength of the human spirit, and he made us laugh. Oh, how he made us laugh.\u201d",

Even though I haven\u2019t spoken to him in years, I will miss him forever.\u201d Eagle-eyed fans will note the \u201cI will miss him forever\u201d line is what the adult version of Wheaton\u2019s character wrote in his story as \u201cStand by Me\u201d drew to a close.",

      "He has shared fit checks and funny clips about his frustrating mornings, and also heartfelt videos about supporting his students and feeling stressed.",
      "But one of his recent videos caught the attention of over 100,000 social media users, including Kardashian. Myers shared a clip of him posing in his classroom. Text over the video included some facts about him, like his Italian roots and past life as a collegiate athlete. In the caption, he wrote, \u201cSomewhere out there is the woman who\u2019s gonna ask how my school day was.\u201d",
      "Kardashian decided to be the one to pose the pivotal question, writing \u201cHow was your day??\u201d in the comments. Her reply received over 80,000 likes and Instagram users immediately chimed in, suggesting that the two meet. Even Kardashian\u2019s close friend Malika Haqq encouraged the potential connection. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the sweetest,\u201d she asked the high school teacher and coach, playing wing woman for her bestie.",
      "Myers left a flirtatious reply: \u201cMine is great now. How was yours?\u201d Then he uploaded a follow-up video, also filmed in his classroom, giving Kardashian a longer response.

      "He tagged Kardashian, Haqq and momager Kris Jenner in the post. \u201cThis is your sign to help a teacher out and tag @khloekardashian. Shooters gotta shoot,\u201d he playfully wrote in the caption.",
      "Myers tells TODAY.com that he decided to post the initial video on a whim when he was preparing for final exams and feeling swamped. He couldn\u2019t have imagined the amount of replies he received.",
      "\u201c(I) honestly never expected the attention. It\u2019s been very overwhelming and exciting at the same time, because I just post the videos for the fun of them,\u201d he shares. \u201cMy students are kind of my main priority. I\u2019m a teacher first and foremost.\u201d",
      "His students were the ones who encouraged him to start using his social media to post about his job.",
      "\u201cThey were like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you make Tiktok videos?\u2019\u201d he recalls them asking. They showed him other TikTokers who are teachers and he realized how many other educators can relate to his experience.",
      "He continues, \u201cI started to create content, and I ended up finding a community of teachers out there that were going through the same things. Just being stressed out as a teacher, but still enjoying it, and I was able to talk to them. Then it ended up creating a little support group in a way. Also, we\u2019re able to trade lesson plans and info. It\u2019s been a huge help to talk with teachers from around the world and connect with them.\u201d",
      "When he saw that Kardashian had noticed his content, he thought he might as well shoot his shot.",
      "\u201cYou never get that many opportunities in my world,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why not? What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known (as) the teacher that asked out Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. I\u2019d rather be known as a great teacher and a great coach, which I think I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my passion.\u201d",
      "Myers, who has nearly 90,000 followers on Instagram now, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting opportunity for me to actually shine a light on education and show people what I teach. There\u2019s a lot of other teachers out there that don\u2019t post and you don\u2019t actually see what they do. And there\u2019s a lot of other teachers that are just like me, who are teaching three different subjects and coaching multiple sports and running programs.\u201d",

      "Reiner, who was 78 when he died, said that before meeting his second wife, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d find love again.",
      "The actor and director was previously married to actress and director Penny Marshall. They wed in 1971 and divorced in 1981.",
      "The aftermath of that split and his struggles to find a new partner were his inspiration for making \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d \u2014 the beloved romantic comedy he directed, starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.",
      "''I was in the middle of my single life. I'd been divorced for a while. I'd been out a number of times, all these disastrous, confusing relationships one after another,\u201d Reiner told The New York Times in 1989.",

      "Reiner called himself the \u201cprototype for Harry\u201d in the movie, a man shocked by his divorce and unable to find love: \u201cI couldn't see how I would get with anybody ever again. It became the basis for the film,\u201d the director told AARP in 2014.",
      "But about three-quarters of the way through making the movie, he met his second wife-to-be, the friend of a colleague.",

      "\u201cAnd he says to me, 'I know this girl. Her name is Michele Singer, and you're going to marry her.' And I said, 'What, are you nuts?'\u201d Reiner recalled to The New York Times.",
      "But when she came to the set one day, he was quickly smitten.",
      "\u201cI'll never forget it. It was a scene on a stoop in front of a brownstone. Billy and Meg are having an argument. And I look over, and I see this girl, and whoo! I was attracted immediately. And Barry says, 'That's Michele.' I said, 'That's Michele?'\u201d",
      "After meeting her, Reiner thought, \"I see how this could work again,\" he told AARP.",
      "Michele Singer was a photographer, producer and actress. The couple married in May 1989 and had three children.",
      "\"As you go along, the relationship becomes better and better because you really become best friends. And that has happened,\u201d Reiner told AARP about his second marriage.",

      "\u201cIt was going to be the two of them seeing each other after years, talking, and then walking away from each other,\u201d he said on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Wassail might be \u201call over the town\u201d this month, but what is it, exactly?",
      "Every holiday season, carolers sing about drinking eggnog by the fire like Medieval people did, or indulging in a holiday punch or Christmas goose like any of a number of Victorian families, all of which many modern folk still enjoy.",
      "However, some songs blaring over shopping mall speakers or the sound systems of holiday-themed bars make us wonder: What the heck is wassail? Why don\u2019t we still eat sugar plums and roasted chestnuts?",
      "And, perhaps most importantly, what is figgy pudding and why does Bing Crosby want it so badly?",
      "Figgy Pudding (\u2018We Wish You a Merry Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cNow, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it right here\u201d",
      "Merry modern revelers sing this song without knowing that \u201cfiggy pudding\u201d historically did not contain figs, as it was a misinterpretation of a British holiday classic \u2014 plum pudding \u2014 which is not a pudding in the American sense, but a dense, boiled dessert.",
      "The dish that became figgy pudding was originally more on the savory side, with preserved, sweetened meat and boiled vegetables, but eventually included prunes. Also, the word \u201cplum\u201d eventually became a label for all dried fruits, confusing the issue further.",
      "While stateside bakers don\u2019t traditionally prepare this complex treat for the holidays, save for brave souls like YouTubers Tyler Williams and Safiya Nygaard in 2022, it is still regularly sold in British stores.",
      "A version of figgy pudding being sold at luxury department store Harrods features sultanas, raisins, demerara sugar, pitted plums, figs \u2014 unlike its historical predecessor \u2014 and a butterscotch sauce, for $24.",
      "Sugar Plums (\u2018\u2019Twas the Night Before Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads\u201d",
      "Interestingly, the history of figgy pudding and sugar plums are related since they both use the word \u201cplum\u201d to refer to fruit or dessert.",
      "A sugar plum is a sugar-coated candy popular in Victorian times which often had a dried fruit like a cherry or fig or nut in the center. Not a plum at all, its name referred to its size and shape.",
      "In 2024, YouTuber Max Miller of Tasting History made sugar plums the traditional way and discovered how time-consuming it is to roll a nut in layer after layer of warm sugar until it becomes candy-coated.",
      "This might be why sugar plums live in the lyrics of this Christmas ditty and not actually in our modern tradition.",
      "Cup of Cheer (\u2018A Holly Jolly Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cHave a cup of cheer\u201d",
      "While a cup that makes you cheerful these days may be a strong cocktail made by Sam Heughan, the term doesn\u2019t only mean adult beverages in vintage Christmas lyricism. A \u201ccup of cheer\u201d can also refer to hot cocoa.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Wassail (\u2018Gloucestershire Wassail,\u2019 \u2018Here We Come A-Wassailing\u2019 and More)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWassail! Wassail all over the town!\u201d",
      "The term wassail has an olde English history: The hot mulled punch, which often consists of cider, wine or ale with winter spices, comes from the words \u201cwaes hael\u201d which means \u201cbe healthy.\u201d",
      "The term is also also a verb: Back in olden times, groups of revelers went door-to-door wassailing with a wassailing bowl, offering sips of drink from it for gifts at each home they visited. This tradition may seem familiar because it\u2019s actually where Christmas caroling comes from.",
      "Roasted Chestnuts (\u2018The Christmas Song\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cChestnuts roasting on an open fire\u201d",
      "The opener to Nat King Cole\u2019s classic rendition of \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d features a once-abundant treat enjoyed by early Americans during the holidays. In the 18th and 19th centuries, chestnuts were one of the most popular ingredients in early American food because of the preponderance of Chestnut trees speckling the East Coast at the time.",
      "For this Christmas tradition, a roasted chestnut has a soft texture and some say it tastes mild and sweet with a fluffy or potato-like texture \u2014 though one social media user who isn\u2019t a fan claims they have a \u201cmealy\u201d texture.",
      "Sadly, in 1904, a fungal disease tore through chestnut tree populations in the U.S., causing them to almost go extinct and fall out of favor as a traditional treat as a result, although countries like Turkey and Italy still feature the glossy brown nut during the holidays."

    "story": [
      "Rough seas. An almost moonless night. And a small fishing boat crossing a treacherous stretch of the Caribbean Sea, carrying precious cargo with a target on her back.",
      "Those were the conditions that Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado faced when she made perhaps the most perilous part of her journey to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, according to the U.S. Special Forces veteran who planned and aided her escape.",
      "\u201cThere were 5- to 6-foot waves, maybe even bigger waves than that, and we were doing this in the middle of the night,\u201d Bryan Stern, who heads the Tampa, Florida-based Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, told NBC News. \u201cIt was pitch black, almost no moonlight. All of us were very cold and wet.\u201d",
      "But Machado never lost her composure, or her lunch, Stern said, as the skiff lurched in the rough sea and plied through waters that have been targeted, of late, by the U.S. missile strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats.",
      "\u201cShe did fine,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThey call her the Iron Lady for a reason.\u201d",
      "Stern dubbed the extrication operation: \u201cOperation Golden Dynamite.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is overwhelmingly the highest-profile person we\u2019ve rescued,\u201d said Stern, who noted this was the 800th mission his organization carried out.",
      "Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in October for leading the opposition against Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime, said on Thursday that she got help from the U.S. government to leave her hiding place in Venezuela and collect her award.",
      "Stern insisted the operation was paid for \u201cby a series of unnamed donors,\u201d and the U.S. government was aware of what was going on but not directly involved.",
      "\u201cWe designed and implemented the extrication of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado from Venezuela to a friendly country from which she was flown to her next destination,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe were not hired by anyone in the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "In fact, Stern added, \u201cI\u2019ve never received a thank-you note, let alone a dollar, from the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to an email from NBC News seeking information about its possible involvement in Machado\u2019s escape.",
      "Stern said he began planning the mission on Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted to get her to the Nobel prize ceremony on time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were a number of obstacles.\u201d",
      "Getting Machado out of Venezuela required disguising her appearance. Stern did not say exactly what they did to get her out and wouldn\u2019t comment on a Wall Street Journal account that she, at some point, donned a wig.",
      "\u201cHer face was a problem because she is the most famous person in Venezuela outside of Maduro,\u201d he said, noting that there are billboards with Machado\u2019s image everywhere in Venezuela.",
      "The Maduro regime was using Machado\u2019s facial biometrics to try to locate her, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople in the Maduro regime call it the \u2018Hunt for Maria\u2019 the way we would talk about the \u2018Hunt for Bin Laden\u2019,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe had to use a lot of deception, even with some members of her own team.\u201d",
      "Stern said he met Machado for the first time on Tuesday evening. He would not say exactly when or where he rendezvoused with Machado, but it involved her taking a small skiff from a fishing village and transferring her at sea to the somewhat bigger fishing boat that he was on.",
      "\u201cI was on the second leg of the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cI got very close to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "But Machado\u2019s departure, which was supposed to happen Tuesday morning, was delayed till evening by a broken engine, he said. And what should have been a three or four-hour trip turned into a roughly 16-hour ordeal.",
      "\u201cI first met her at sea,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe used a fishing boat to get her to her flight.\u201d",
      "Stern said the flight took off from Cura\u00e7ao, which is about 40 miles north of Venezuela and is a self-governing island that is part of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cI would say we transited through Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d Stern said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Cura\u00e7ao. She never cleared immigration in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201d",
      "Stern said this was the most challenging mission he and his group have undertaken. As for Machado, Stern said he\u2019s a big fan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero of mine.\u201d"

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sound of gentle singing filled the air on Bondi Beach, the site of Australia's deadliest shooting in almost three decades.",
      "Alon Meltzer, 37, an associate rabbi at the nearby Mizrachi Synagogue, was among those who on Monday sang Hebrew prayers about fellowship, compassion and mercy near the place where two attackers targeted a Hanukkah celebration a day earlier. Officials have designated the incident \u201cantisemitic terrorism.\u201d",

After a 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur that killed 35 people, the country overhauled its gun laws precisely to prevent such an attack from ever happening again. According to police, who seized three firearms and two improvised explosive devices from the scene at Bondi Beach, the 50-year-old suspect was a licensed firearms holder who owned six firearms.",

      "In the aftermath of the shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his National Cabinet vowed Monday to eradicate the \u201cevil scourge\u201d of antisemitism and take other steps like further tightening the country\u2019s already stringent gun control measures and establishing a centralized National Hate Crimes and Incidents Database.",
      "Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said Albanese and the Australian government have, thus far, been \u201call talk and no action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the first incident of this kind in Australia, just the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWarm words of embrace are just not going to cut it. We\u2019re looking for action, changes of policies.\u201d",

It\u2019s not just a battle for the Jewish people. This is a battle on evil. Just because you feel you\u2019re right, you can\u2019t gun down people cold bloodedly.\u201d",
      "Gluckowsky likened the Bondi Beach attack to the pogroms that European Jews endured for centuries. He said governments worldwide, and especially in the West, have been slow to respond to rising anti-Jewish hatred.",
      "Both Gluckowsky and Cooper contend that pro-Palestinian demonstrations have fanned the flames of antisemitism. And Australia\u2019s decision in September to formally recognize a Palestinian state was a \u201csignal\u201d to terrorists determined to attack Jews, Cooper said.",
      "\u201cThey have allowed Jews to twist in the wind,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday, Albanese was asked whether he saw any link between the recognition of a Palestinian state and the Bondi shooting.",

      "Cooper\u2019s denunciation came a day after a father-son terror team opened fire on a Hanukkah celebration taking place on the iconic beach. The 50-year-old father died at the scene. His 24-year-old son remained in a coma in a hospital on Monday, officials said.",
      "So far, Australian officials have not released their names or divulged a motive. But since the Israeli-Hamas war erupted two years ago, Australian lawmakers and experts have reported a surge in antisemitic incidents.",
      "The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people in Israel, and the Israeli military response led to the death of over 70,000 in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d an Australian parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism concluded in October 2024.",
      "Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry reported 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents across the country between Oct. 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025.",
      "There were 2,062 such incidents the year before, an all-time high for Australia, the organization reported.",
      "Homes, cars and schools were vandalized with anti-Israel messages. A synagogue and childcare center were targeted by arsonists. Two nurses were suspended for posting online that they would kill or not treat Jewish patients.",
      "And police in January foiled what they said was an antisemitic plot when officers seized a travel trailer packed with explosives.",
      "Most of the threats were reported in Sydney and Melbourne, which are Australia\u2019s biggest cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population of around 117,000.",
      "Previously, Australian lawmakers responded to the threats by passing tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "Now they\u2019re looking into tightening Australia\u2019s gun laws to make it harder for residents to get their hands on the kind of high-powered rifles and shotguns that were reportedly used Sunday to stain the sands of Bondi Beach with blood.",
      "Antisemitism online has also spiked in recent years, fueled by anger around the conflict between Israel and Hamas and enabled by a new freewheeling social media landscape where content moderation on sites like X and others has been loosened.",
      "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches misinformation and extremism, found a 4,963% increase in the number of antisemitic YouTube comments on conflict-related videos, compared to the days before the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "For months after the incident, the institute found that fringe platforms like 4chan, Bitchute, Gab and Telegram saw a 50% increase in daily antisemitic comments made.",
      "Sunday\u2019s shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in Australia since April 1996, when a gunman armed with two semi-automatic weapons went on a rampage in the tourist town of Port Arthur, on the island of Tasmania, that left 35 dead and 23 wounded.",
      "That bloodletting resulted in legislation that banned ownership of most automatic and semiautomatic rifles and drastically reduced the number of mass killings in Australia.",
      "Growing emotional, Gluckowsky said they are \u201cgoing to stand strong and carry on\u201d despite what happened on Bondi Beach.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t be intimidated or inhibited of who we are as Jews,\u201d he said.",

      "Lai, one of the most prominent critics of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, was arrested in 2020 shortly after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in response to the anti-government protests, which roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019 and sometimes turned violent.",
      "He was found guilty of two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials under legislation from Hong Kong\u2019s time as a British colony.",
      "Lai, who turned 78 last week and faces life in prison, will be sentenced later and is allowed to appeal. On Monday, he appeared thin but in good spirits as he entered the courtroom wearing glasses, a pale green sweater and a gray jacket, smiling and waving to his family.",
      "Western governments and rights groups have criticized the 156-day trial, which began in December 2023, as politically motivated. Both the United States and Britain have called for Lai, a British citizen, to be released, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to \u201cfree\u201d him.",
      "In their 855-page verdict, the three handpicked judges focused on Lai's interactions with senior U.S. government officials, including meetings he had at the height of the 2019 protests with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and multiple members of Congress.",
      "Judge Esther Toh said Lai had persistently lobbied Washington to \u201chelp bring down\u201d the Chinese government by imposing sanctions, blockades or other hostile measures \u201cwith the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "She said it was \u201canalogous to the situation where an American national asked for help from Russia to bring down the U.S. government under the guise of helping the state of California.\u201d",

      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty and spent 52 days testifying, denied using his overseas connections to influence foreign policy on China and Hong Kong. He also said he never intended to \u201cpollute\u201d his readers\u2019 minds but was only commenting on facts.",
      "Toh said Lai had \u201cnever wavered in his intention to destabilize\u201d the Chinese government, citing his WhatsApp messages, live chats, Fox News interviews and social media posts. She said he continued to pursue his goals even after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020, but \u201cin a less explicit way.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe law will never allow anyone, regardless of profession or background, to openly harm their own country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. A White House official confirmed to NBC News last month that Trump discussed Lai\u2019s case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea in October.",

      "The Hong Kong and Chinese governments say Lai has received a fair trial and that the criticism is an attempt to undermine the city\u2019s rule of law. They say press freedom continues to be protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.",

      "Lai has spent nearly five years in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2020, during which time he has been convicted on multiple other charges, including unauthorized assembly and fraud. His family and supporters have expressed growing concern about his health, as Lai suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart palpitations.",

      "Though the Lai trial is Hong Kong\u2019s highest-profile case stemming from the crackdown, it has \u201cmuch less significant\u201d implications for the city\u2019s press freedom and autonomy than two other cases from last year, said John Burns, an emeritus professor specializing in Chinese politics at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "Those cases are the convictions of two journalists accused of sedition over their work for the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Stand News and the subversion charges against 47 pro-democracy figures over their involvement in an unofficial primary election, 45 of whom were convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Open dissent has been chilled in Hong Kong under the Beijing-imposed national security law and related local legislation, both of which officials say were necessary to restore stability after the 2019 protests. Most of the city\u2019s pro-democracy figures have been imprisoned, quit politics or moved overseas.",
      "The verdict in Lai\u2019s case comes a day after Hong Kong\u2019s last major opposition party, the Democratic Party, disbanded after a vote by its members, who cited pressure from Chinese officials or intermediaries.",
      "It also comes a week after near-record-low turnout in a \u201cpatriots only\u201d legislative election held under rules that were changed in 2021 to require national security vetting of candidates. Officials have defended the new rules as necessary to restore stability, but critics say they have sidelined groups such as the Democratic Party and left the legislature without any meaningful opposition.",
      "Tensions were already running high in Hong Kong amid public grief over a fire at a high-rise housing complex last month that killed at least 160 people in the city\u2019s worst blaze in almost 80 years. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have vowed to punish any \u201canti-China\u201d forces that try to use the tragedy to \u201crecreate the chaos\u201d of 2019."

      "Kast\u2019s commanding lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "Many voters are frustrated with the options",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast\u2019s claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election and later endorsed Kast, substantial support for Franco Parisi \u2014 a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",

      "Even if elected, it remains uncertain whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises. They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile\u2019s March 11 presidential inauguration, warning immigrants without legal status that they should get out before they \u201chave to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in Santiago, the capital, said he and like-minded Chileans are \u201calso counting down the days, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast.\u201d",
      "Boric\u2019s left-wing government is under fire",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua seized clandestine migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America\u2019s safest and wealthiest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has hovered around just 30% for the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe are living through a moment of psychosis, thanks to this government,\u201d said Nati P\u00e9rez, an 87-year-old Peruvian who immigrated to Chile over a decade ago, heading to vote for Kast at an old railroad terminal in central Santiago that was converted into a vast polling center for the day. \u201cHe\u2019s not against immigrants, he\u2019s against crime. Venezuela sent all their criminals here.\u201d",
      "Others say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile\u2019s market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile\u2019s northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country\u2019s first public security ministry.",
      "\u201cI actually thought this government would be worse. I have to admit that it has improved security,\u201d said Mariano Jara, 55, emerging from a polling station where he said he voted for Kast. \u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done. There\u2019s room to get tougher.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s homicide rate has fallen in the last two years, now on par with the rate in the United States. But that has done nothing to change the widespread feeling of insecurity.",
      "In Chile, just 39% of people feel safe walking alone at night, according to a recent Gallup survey of 144 countries. That\u2019s around the same figure as in Ecuador, which is now in the midst of a violent, drug-driven crime wave. In Libya, where fractious militias jostle for political power, over 70% of people said they feel safe.",
      "Crime and migration overshadow all other concerns",
      "As Boric\u2019s former minister of labor, Jara became popular as the architect of the administration\u2019s most important welfare measures.",
      "That matters little now. Voters\u2019 concerns have forced her to switch gears. She has vowed to toughen border security, register undocumented migrants, tackle money laundering and step up police raids.",
      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",
      "Learning from his previous two failed presidential runs, Kast has avoided topics that fire up his critics \u2014 such as his German-born father\u2019s Nazi past, nostalgia for Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "When asked about his deeply conservative values, Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine, says only that they remain the same. His supporters, including voters who previously spurned him over his stance on social issues, now say they\u2019re willing to trade abstract human rights concerns for increased safety on the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to hear that he\u2019s going to separate immigrant children from their parents, it\u2019s sad, that\u2019s going to be a problem for me,\u201d said Natacha Feliz, a 27-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, referring to a recent interview in which Kast said immigrant parents without legal status who didn\u2019t self-deport would be obliged to hand their kids over to the state.",
      "\u201cBut this is happening everywhere, not just in Chile. Let\u2019s just hope that our security situation improves.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump vowed retaliation Saturday after two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian U.S. interpreter were killed in an attack in Syria, an incident the Defense Department said occurred during a counterterrorism engagement.",
      "\"This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"There will be very serious retaliation.\"",
      "Three other U.S. personnel were wounded in the attack in Palmyra, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesperson, said on X. The soldiers \"were conducting a key leader engagement\" in \"support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations,\" he said.",
      "\"This attack is currently under active investigation,\" Parnell said.",
      "U.S. Central Command said that the attack was an ambush by \"a lone ISIS gunman\" and that the gunman was engaged and killed.",
      "A Pentagon official told NBC News the attack occurred in an area outside the control of Syria\u2019s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that U.S. partner forces killed the person who carried out the attack. He did not provide additional details about the perpetrator or the forces involved.",
      "\"The savage who perpetrated this attack was killed by partner forces,\" Hegseth wrote, adding that those who target Americans \"will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Syria\u2019s Interior Ministry, Nour al-Din al-Baba, said on state television that internal security officials had issued warnings to partner forces operating in the Badia region about the possibility of an Islamic State attack. He said the U.S.-led coalition did not take those warnings seriously.",
      "The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had reported that the attacker is a member of Syrian security forces. Al-Baba said the person had no leadership role within Syria's internal security forces and was not serving as an escort to leadership at the time of the attack.",
      "The Pentagon has not released additional details beyond statements on social media.",
      "Trump addressed the attack ahead of Saturday's Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, calling it an ambush and mourning the deaths. Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. would retaliate, he said, \"Yeah, we will.\"",
      "The U.S. military has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly stationed in the northeast, where they work with local security to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State. The U.S. and other nations have re-engaged with Damascus under al-Sharaa since rebels ousted former President Bashar al-Assad."
