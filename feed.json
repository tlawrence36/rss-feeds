      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival catalogue can be overwhelming to navigate, with around 90 feature films playing across 11 days.",
      "This year the Robert Redford-founded independent film festival has something for everyone: Comedies, dramas, horrors, documentaries, the intriguingly undefinable (there\u2019s a movie about cabbage smuggling called \u201cBubble & Squeak\u201d and one in which a woman becomes a chair and everyone likes her better that way called \u201cBy Design\u201d).",
      "Here are a few of the films we\u2019re looking forward to most:",
      "This is a film that the producers would rather audiences experience blind, but the brief synopsis is that Alia Shawkat plays an aspiring actress in a military role-playing facility who falls for a soldier playing an insurgent. Luca Guadagnino produced the film, written and directed by Hailey Gates. It also stars Callum Turner and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. When asked how she likes to describe the film, Gates told The Associated Press that, \u201cSometimes I describe it as a military industrial complex romantic comedy.\u201d",
      "This film delves into the life of a Chinese-American \u201ccam girl,\u201d kind of a virtual sex worker, who is navigating a toxic relationship with a client while attempting to repair her relationship with her dying father. Katarina Zhu wrote, directed and stars in the film, alongside Rachel Sennott.",
      "Pulitzer Prize-winner Mstyslav Chernov took audiences into the first days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the Oscar-winning \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d and is back with another dispatch from the ongoing war. In \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between the AP and Frontline, Chernov turns his lens to Ukrainian soldiers attempting to traverse one mile of forest to reclaim the occupied village Andriivka. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, horrifying portrait of the futility of war,\u201d said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming.",
      "Steven Soderbergh produced this film from first time filmmaker Rachael Abigail Holder about three Brooklynites navigating relationships and a changing city. Andr\u00e9 Holland stars alongside Nicole Beharie and DeWanda Wise.",
      "This is a documentary about a failed attempt to make documentary about the Zodiac Killer, from filmmaker Charlie Shackleton. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many cases as puzzling as that of the Zodiac Killer, despite half a century of clues compiled in countless true crime TV shows, podcasts and books,\u201d Shackelton wrote. He walks the viewer through what could have been in this film that fell apart in this meta commentary on the ubiquitous true crime genre.",
      "Clint Bentley, who co-wrote \u201cSing Sing,\u201d directs this adaptation of a Denis Johnson story about a day laborer working the railroads in the early 20th century, starring Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones. In his director\u2019s statement, Bentley said, \u201cIt\u2019s about the people left behind by modernization. It\u2019s about the toll industrialization takes on the natural world. It\u2019s about the possibilities love can open up in our lives and about the hope that can blossom in the aftermath of grief.\"",
      "Black generational farmers in rural Georgia are the subject of this black-and-white documentary from first time filmmaker Brittany Shayne. The film shines a spotlight on their struggle to maintain their land amid discriminatory government policies.",
      "This Norwegian film about a fairy tale kingdom and stepsisters competing to be the most beautiful for the prince has been described, intriguingly, as \u201cThe Substance\u201d meets \u201cBridgerton.\u201d Writer and director Emilie Blichfeldt could be poised to join Coralie Fargeat and Julia Ducournau as filmmakers reinventing the body horror genre from a female gaze.",
      "A neighborhood dispute in Florida turns deadly in this inventive film from Geeta Gandbhir, constructed largely with police bodycam footage, which examines the state\u2019s \u201cstand your ground laws.\u201d",
      "Barry Jenkins produced this film from writer-director-star Eva Victor, which is reason enough to take note. \u201cThere are scenes in this film that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cI was struck by this film because of the way that this filmmaker chooses to tell the story and framing her character\u2019s trauma through a very innovative way of storytelling. It was a real revelation to see.\u201d",
      "Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson won an Oscar for his portrait of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival in \u201cSummer of Soul,\u201d and now he\u2019s back and focused on one of the performers that day: Sly Stone. This new film grapples with the question of the burden of Black genius (also its title) as it tells the story of his rise, his cultural influence and his struggles with drugs. Elegance Bratton is also debuting an accidental companion doc, \u201cMove Ya Body: The Birth of House.\u201d",
      "Also of note among music-themed documentaries: Amy Berg\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley\u201d; Kevin MacDonald\u2019s \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d a Venice film that\u2019s getting a spotlight showing at Sundance; Isabel Castro\u2019s \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d about Selena Quintanilla.",
      "Filmmaker Rashad Frett looks at life after incarceration through the character Ricky (Stephan James), who was locked up in his teens and is now 30-years-old trying to rebuild his life. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly moving story about family and how he\u2019s reintegrating into society and just the real struggles that he is going through in that process,\u201d Yutani said.",
      "Olivia Colman and John Lithgow play father and daughter in this LGBTQ-themed film from Sophie Hyde (the filmmaker behind \u201cGood Luck to You, Leo Grande\u201d ). It revolves around a visit to Amsterdam with her non-binary teenager to stay with Lithgow\u2019s character, who is gay. \u201cThe way that these two truly gifted actors are able to portray the love and the tension, you really trust that they\u2019re depicting characters who have a long complex life together,\u201d festival director Eugene Hernandez said.",

      "Dozens of jurors will return to a Los Angeles courtroom for the possibility of serving on the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge said he expects a jury will be chosen at the trial of A$AP Rocky on Thursday, while lawyers for the hip-hop star are protesting the dearth of Black candidates for the panel.",
      "Nearly one hundred potential jurors will pack into the Los Angeles courtroom for a third long day of questioning at the trial, where Rocky is accused of two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for allegedly firing on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.",
      "Opening statements will begin once 12 of them, and four alternates, are seated.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to have a jury tomorrow,\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold said at the end of court Wednesday, thanking the panelists for their patience. \u201cThis is not going to go on forever.\u201d",
      "Other than dismissals for cause, each side can have 10 jurors dismissed without giving a reason. The defense has used four of its challenges. Prosecutors used just one. They said they are happy with the jury as currently composed. But that may change.",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Rocky said they planned to appeal a judge's rejection of their request for a hearing on why less than 5% of the jury pool is Black, while the area they are drawn from is 9% African American. It's possible that none of the 16 jurors selected will be Black.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re troubled by that to say the least,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said. \u201cWe\u2019re in downtown Los Angeles, not a small town in Montana.\u201d",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton said on the social platform X that he has been following the proceedings and was critical of the racial makeup of the juror pool.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely ridiculous that the jury will be not fair and representative, so as to deprive A$AP Rocky of a fair trial,\u201d the post said. \u201cI am monitoring this trial and challenging the Los Angeles District Attorney to ensure that fair and representative justice is afforded to A$AP Rocky.\u201d",
      "The judge declined to pause the trial for the appeal.",
      "Prosecutors questioned potential jurors Wednesday about their attitudes toward police and celebrity.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked how many of the 12 people in the jury box during the first round of questioning consider themselves fans of Rihanna, who is Rocky's longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler sons. Four said they were.",
      "He asked them whether they'll worry about the effect that convicting Rocky \u2014 on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, which could lead to many years in prison \u2014 could have on Rihanna.",
      "\u201cYou put it in my head, and now I'm like, \u2018Oh, it would affect her,\u2019\u201d one woman in the jury box responded.",
      "Rocky, who is free on bail and has pleaded not guilty, sat at the defense table, watching the questioning.",
      "Rihanna was not in court with him, but Rocky's mother and sister sat in his section of the gallery.",
      "When told who they were, Arnold marveled at the youthful appearance of his mother, Renee Black.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat's on the record.\u201d",
      "Jury selection began Tuesday after the 36-year-old Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, turned down a deal offering 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended sentence and three years\u2019 probation if he would plead guilty to one of the two counts.",
      "Rocky is set to headline the Rolling Loud California music festival in March, he has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May, and he has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after.",
      "But his life could be upended if he's convicted of firing a gun at Terell Ephron, a childhood friend who testified that their relationship had soured and a feud came to a head on the night of Nov. 6, 2021. Ephron testified that bullets grazed his knuckles."

      "Meagan Good is basking in her season of harvest, reaping rewards from the hard work she\u2019s sowed throughout her three-decade career",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Meagan Good is in a season of harvest, reaping rewards from the hard work she\u2019s sowed throughout her three-decade career. For the \u201cHarlem\u201d star, gratitude is her mantra.",
      "\u201cAs crazy as, not even just this last year, the last few years have been for me, this is the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. And it\u2019s pretty wonderful,\u201d said Good last week with tears welling in her eyes, emotions heightened as she thought of her relationship with Jonathan Majors, her time on \u201cHarlem\u201d and the Los Angeles wildfires.\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for the journey and I\u2019m thankful to be loved.\u201d",
      "Much of that love has been provided by embattled actor Jonathan Majors, and the fluctuating journey includes their scrutinized relationship, leading Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDivorce in the Black\u201d film and starring in the third and final season of \u201cHarlem,\u201d premiering Thursday on Prime Video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that the people who have supported us and have watched the show have waited on us like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Good, who plays Camille, a Columbia University professor of sex and love. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be a part of something so amazing that people love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHarlem\u201d has been a survivor, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic and the Hollywood actors and writers strikes. The Tracy Oliver dramedy follows four women in their 30s (Good, Grace Byers, Jerrie Johnson and Shoniqua Shandai) living in Manhattan\u2019s historic Black neighborhood as they navigate love, friendships and careers. While the series didn\u2019t reach the acclaim of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d it earned a staunch fan base.",
      "\u201cIf you really think about shows about New York, it\u2019s almost like purposefully excluding Black people ... so when we reflect on shows like \u2018Friends\u2019 or even \u2018Sex and The City,\u2019 I probably can count on one hand how many Black people I\u2019ve seen in those shows. But in New York, it\u2019s unavoidable because Black people have created the culture here, specifically in Harlem,\u201d said Johnson, who plays Tye, a queer dating app designer for LBGTQ+ people of color.",
      "\u201cWe loved our \u2018Living Single,\u2019 and that\u2019s why we loved it because we love seeing these women meeting in this small little apartment to commune with each other ... that\u2019s why we have such a cult following because there was a hole in the market that Tracy brilliantly filled.\u201d",
      "Good, 43, said the relationship she shares with her cast, crew and streaming platform is one she hadn\u2019t experienced. \u201cThis definitely has been the best professional experience I\u2019ve had in my entire career in terms of emotionally, mentally, professionally, spiritually.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an emphatic declaration by the former child star whose first major film appearance came in Ice Cube\u2019s 1995 classic \u201cFriday,\u201d shined in \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou\u201d and became a household name to kids on Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cCousin Skeeter\u201d series.",
      "Adored for beauty throughout her relatively drama-free career, many fans questioned her relationship with Majors, the rapidly rising star of \u201cCreed III\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d It began toward the end of 2023 following the 35-year-old\u2019s arrest for allegations of escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse toward ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.",
      "But the \u201cThink Like a Man\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d actor said her Christian faith and life lessons prepared her for the backlash.",
      "\u201cI think about being in my 20s and you see the Media Take Outs and it\u2019s a hundred nice things and there\u2019s like one or two bad things. And I would just internalize it and I would cry and it would hurt my feelings so much,\u201d said Good, who also cited criticism from fellow Christians about her attire and film choices, false skin-bleaching allegations, and the end of her near decade-long marriage with pastor and Hollywood executive DeVon Franklin as perseverance-builders. \u201cI had been praying for maybe like five or six years, \u2019Lord, please deliver me from what people think about me. \u2026 But I will say the part of it that is still hard for me is to see them drag people I love.\u201d",
      "Majors was convicted of one misdemeanor assault charge and a harassment violation. He avoided jail time but was ordered to complete a yearlong counseling program. He also settled a civil suit with Jabbari, but the ordeal nearly extinguished his career.",
      "Good, who was by Majors\u2019 side at court dates and became in engaged to him in November, is optimistic his career will regenerate. (Ironically, Good starred in 50 Cent\u2019s \u201c21 Questions\u201d hit music video in which he proposes scenarios to a potential girlfriend to see if she\u2019d stand by him, including incarceration.)",
      "\u201cThe idea that people are like, \u2019Well, she got paid,\u201d said Good, rolling her eyes at suggestions it\u2019s a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cit could be hurtful, but I just don\u2019t care anymore. And that\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d",
      "Good, who aspires to star in an action film, has been open about her desire to have children and is focusing on her future with Majors, including launching a health and wellness brand together.",
      "Admirers and industry colleagues believe Good deserves much more recognition.",
      "\u201cPeople have tried to pigeonhole her in a certain area that now she\u2019s breaking free. I always tell her that this is her phoenix moment ... the ashes actually being a metaphor for people\u2019s expectations of her,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAbout 75% of my favorite movies that shaped my upbringing have Meagan Good in them ... I\u2019ve learned so much about transitioning into womanhood and adulthood through the characters that she\u2019s played.\u201d",
      "Good, however, stresses her focus is not on recognition or major awards, but reaching the hearts of people. She circles back to gratitude for a career that has defied Hollywood odds.",
      "\u201cTo have any appreciation is a gift,\u201d said Good. \u201cI feel like my best is yet to come. And I feel like even now, I\u2019m kind of just getting started.\u201d",

      "The camera is the ghost in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s chillingly effective, experiential haunted house drama \u201cPresence.\u201d",
      "The camera is the ghost in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s chillingly effective, experiential haunted house drama \u201cPresence.\u201d The filmmaker traps the audience in a beautiful suburban home, letting us drift through rooms with this curious being, in and out of delicate conversations as we (and the ghost) try to piece together a puzzle blindly.",
      "Often in haunted house movies where a new family moves in and starts sensing strange things, the ghost knows exactly what they want \u2014 usually their house back. In this one, the presence doesn\u2019t have such a clear objective. It\u2019s more confused, wandering around and investigating the surroundings, like a benevolent amnesiac. Occasionally, though, big emotions erupt, and things shake violently.",
      "Mostly, they go unnoticed. They observe the chipper real estate agent (Julia Fox) preparing for a showing, the painting crew, one of whom believes there\u2019s something around, and finally the family and all the complexities of its dynamics. Lucy Liu (a delightful, wickedly funny scene-stealer) is the mom, Rebecca, a wealthy, successful, type-A woman hyper focused on the success of her eldest, a teenage boy named Tyler (Eddy Maday). The father, Chris (Chris Sullivan), is more of the nurturer, concerned about their teen daughter Chloe (Callina Liang) in the aftermath of her friend\u2019s unexpected death.",
      "There is a family drama transpiring inside the house, only some of which will make sense in the end. We overhear Rebecca drunkenly telling Tyler that everything she does is for him. We listen in as Chris confides to someone on the phone about a hypothetical partner being involved in something illegal and whether they still would be if legally separated. We see Tyler often with his head buried in his phone. And then there's Chloe: Sad, rebellious Chloe, who is the only one to notice that they\u2019re not alone. She\u2019s had the recent trauma, after all, and soon she\u2019s starting a thing with Tyler\u2019s floppy haired, cool guy friend Ryan (West Mulholland). They hook up, they drink, they do drugs, and Chloe gets to escape from her own thoughts \u2014 at least for a little while. Ryan looks straight out of a mid-90s movie, he's an angry, aggrieved kid who assures Chloe that she has the power to decide how this all goes.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d was written by David Koepp (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d) off of a few pages Soderbergh put together, imagining what it would be like to be the ghost. He is that too, technically, as both director and cinematographer on the project. It\u2019s a slow-burn experience that sneaks up on you, especially once you\u2019ve seen how it plays out. Personally, I didn\u2019t see any of it coming and couldn\u2019t have anticipated the emotional wallop it would pack in the end. It\u2019s a heady experiment that transcends the somewhat gimmicky-on-paper premise \u2014 something Soderbergh manages to do alarmingly well and regularly.",
      "January releases aren\u2019t often the most compelling. Aside from the annual rollout of awards contenders, it\u2019s more often than not a dumping ground. \u201cPresence\u201d is a movie that I first saw last January at the Sundance Film Festival, and yet, even after a year, the chill and the admiration has stubbornly lingered in my mind, like a ghost that just won\u2019t go away, while so many other films have simply faded from memory. It is a rare gem in the January mix.",
      "\u201cPresence,\u201d a Neon release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cteen drinking, drug material, sexuality, language, violence.\u201d Running time: 85 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "\u201cAt a time when our planet is burning from the impact of global warming and human-made climate catastrophe, \u2018Dear Everything\u2019 is a powerful musical uprising,\" Fonda said in an email.",
      "The concert-musical hybrid has songs by Justin Tranter, Caroline Pennell and Eren Cannata, choreography by Christiana Hunte and direction by Tony Award-winner Diane Paulus.",
      "V will play the narrator for the story she wrote with 10 singers as well as a youth choir. The show doesn't spell out a single prescription for climate change but hopes to inspire collective action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about the politics of solution. It\u2019s about the politics of connection,\u201d says V. \u201cI think it\u2019s imaginative.

Not by pounding them over the head, but by saying, \u2018Listen to the kids. Listen to young people.

      "V describes the Earth as a woman and sees her activism against climate change as part of her overall fight to protect and honor women.",
      "\u201cWe made the mission to end violence against women, girls and trans and non-binary people and the Earth because it was all part of the same story,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're still going.\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Walter Van Beirendonck, one of the last standing designers of the legendary Antwerp Six, delivered a menswear show Wednesday that blended surreal whimsy with biting social commentary at Paris Fashion Week.",
      "As models paraded in oversized beige bowler hats and loose \u201970s check suits with retro boho collars, the collection danced between nostalgia and avant-garde theatrics.",
      "In true Van Beirendonck style, fun collided with the macabre. Edward Scissorhands seemed to haunt the atelier, inspiring sharp-cut deconstructed suits with elongated fake fingers. Skull-and-bone motifs were playful winks on caps, while angular caterpillar shapes crept under sneaker-boots.",
      "Headscarves borrowed from '50s femininity were reimagined into sculptural 3D objects, their abstract forms adding a tactile depth.",
      "Alien energy infused the collection, notably in a spidery face mask paired with those rounded, otherworldly fingers. The eerie yet playful theme persisted, complemented by a mourning black veil resembling a beekeeper\u2019s hat \u2014 a nod to fragility amid the absurd.",
      "The collection was as much about pushing boundaries as it was about sartorial musings.",
      "While Van Beirendonck\u2019s spectacles won\u2019t appeal to traditional tastes, his ability to channel personal and societal tensions into bold, wearable art remains unparalleled. Through his alien alphabets, absurdist headpieces and theatrical proportions, he continues to prove that fashion, at its most compelling, is about daring to question."

      "Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Steven Soderbergh isn\u2019t just the director and cinematographer of his latest film. He\u2019s also, in a way, its central character.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d is filmed entirely from the POV of a ghost inside a home a family has just moved into. Soderbergh, who serves as his own cinematographer under the pseudonym Peter Andrews (his father's name), essentially performs as the presence, a floating point-of-view that watches as the violence that killed the mysterious ghost threatens to be repeated.",
      "For even the prolific Soderbergh, the film, which opens Friday in theaters, was a unique challenge. He shot \u201cPresence\u201d with a small digital camera while wearing slippers to soften his steps.",
      "The 62-year-old filmmaker recently met a reporter in a midtown Manhattan hotel in between finishing post-production on his other upcoming movie (\"Black Bag,\" a thriller Focus Features will release March 14) and beginning production in a few weeks on his next project, a romantic comedy that he says \u201cfeels like a George Cukor movie.\u201d",
      "Soderbergh, whose films include \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d the \u201cOcean's 11\u201d movies, \u201cMagic Mike\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d tends to do a lot in small windows of time. \u201cPresence\u201d took 11 days to film.",
      "That dexterous proficiency has made the ever-experimenting Soderbergh one of Hollywood's most widely respected evaluators of the movie business. In a wide-ranging conversation, he discussed why he thinks streaming is the most destructive force the movies have ever faced and why he's \u201cthe cockroach of this industry.\"",
      "SODERBERGH: No, but what I did is subtle. For the first and only time Peter Andrews has a camera operator credit. That\u2019s not a credit that I typically take because I don\u2019t need it and I typically have another operator working with me. But I felt like this was a workout. It was tricky, but really fun. It was another level of performance anxiety because I ruined more takes than anyone else in the film by a larger factor. I was the one going: \u201cCut. I f\u2014ed that up. We got to go again.\u201d",
      "SODERBERGH: The beauty of projects at this scale is I can just do them without having to talk to anybody. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want notes. It\u2019s because it\u2019s just the brain trust and none of the psychic real estate is taken up by things that have nothing to do with what you\u2019re going to shoot. I went from that into a more traditional project in which a lot of psychic real estate gets taken up by the process of having a studio finance your movie. I like these people, it\u2019s just a lot of lawyers. Like, a lot of lawyers.",
      "SODERBERGH: It removes a key reference point for an artist. It\u2019s helpful to know how something is doing, or how it did. You need to know that to calibrate whether you accomplished what you wanted to accomplish, whether you can work at a certain level. That\u2019s one of the most confusing things about it, the black box of it. Apart from the economic invisibility of what\u2019s going on there \u2014 the fact that we can\u2019t really look under the hood of how these streaming companies work economically \u2014 there\u2019s another kind of handrail that\u2019s missing that I find really helpful. At the end of the day, I, at least, want to know. The market will tell you how you\u2019re doing. I want to know that so I can adjust or go in another direction. Being irrelevant isn\u2019t very appealing. What is the overlap between what people seem to be responding to and what I like? Because I don\u2019t want to make these things and have nobody see them. I\u2019ve had enough people say, \u201cOh, did that come out?\u201d It\u2019s a public art form.",
      "SODERBERGH: The good news is, if you talk to Focus Features and Neon and A24, young people are going to the movies. This is the Letterboxd generation. That\u2019s fantastic. I hope that ripples outside the U.S. They are cine-literate and they expect something singular. They want the signature, they want the stamp of a filmmaker. And that\u2019s turning into a real business. One of the things, I think, we all need to do, but especially the people who cover the industry, is to stop using the studio metric for what a success is. That\u2019s not a template you should be applying to everything.",
      "SODERBERGH: There was a period of about 10 to 14 year where the best movies of the year were also the most popular movies of the year. That\u2019s not necessarily true anymore. You can pick one of the movies that\u2019s in the hunt this year and go: That\u2019s a \u201970s movie. That\u2019s as good and interesting as one of those. But it\u2019s not going to do the business that one of those would have done. It\u2019s the artist\u2019s job to adapt. When it comes to trying to control what people want to go see, you\u2019re now in a place like: \u201cIf I really wish hard, it won\u2019t rain.\u201d The weather is the weather. To a certain degree, the audience is a weather system. Luckily because of the way I began, I\u2019m the cockroach of this industry. I can survive any version of it.",
      "SODERBERGH: Yeah, when you see \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s different.\u201d There are more shots in the first four minutes of \u201cBlack Bag\u201d than the entirety of \u201cPresence.\u201d It\u2019s a different thing and it has different demands.",
      "SODERBERGH: No, it feels more like a natural evolution and a natural response in the sense of: I want to be a different filmmaker for this. I don\u2019t want to know the outcome. If you have a conversation with a filmmaker who says they have \u201cfigured things out,\u201d you should run in the other direction. It's like: You\u2019re deluded and you have a very superficial understanding of what this art form demands if you\u2019re not humbled by what it asks of you to be distinctive.",
      "SODERBERGH: No, I still feel like I\u2019m reaching for something I quite possibly won\u2019t ever grasp and maybe shouldn\u2019t. As frustrating as it may be to feel like I've never made a thing that is at the level of one of my heroes made, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I did feel that. Do you stop, then? The movie \u201cCome and See,\u201d that guy got to basically go: \u201cThat\u2019s my mic drop.\u201d I\u2019ve never made anything approaching that.",
      "SODERBERGH: Oh, I\u2019m very happy with that film. I\u2019m very proud of that film. I can\u2019t say there\u2019s much in it that I\u2019d go back and change. That said, it\u2019s not \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d Or \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d By my standards, I don\u2019t look at it and go, \u201cThat\u2019s as good as \u2018The Third Man.\u2019\u201d I\u2019m good at pushing myself into areas that are slightly beyond my comfort zone, but I also understand what my limitations are. I\u2019m inherently not a grandiose thinker about myself or my work. That\u2019s a critical component to some of the films I\u2019m talking about that I think are amazing. I could never make \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d I don\u2019t think of myself as a filmmaker the way Francis (Ford Coppola) thinks of himself. That\u2019s not: He should be like me or I should be like him. It\u2019s just how we\u2019re built. I\u2019m more earthbound, I guess is the word. And that\u2019s what I like and what I\u2019m good at.",
      "SODERBERGH: I think it\u2019s the way I was born and the way I was raised. And the people who were around me when I was younger who mentored me. I just don\u2019t think I was born with the grandiosity gene and there was nobody around me who would have cultivated that even if I had shown signs. Going to Sundance last year with \u201cPresence\u201d was really gratifying. If you\u2019d told me 35 years later you\u2019re going to come back here (where \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape\u201d premiered in 1989) with a movie that people are interested in seeing, I would have wept."

      "Conductor Rapha\u00ebl Pichon makes his New York debut at age 40 on Thursday night, leading the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s at Carnegie Hall",
      "NEW YORK -- Rapha\u00ebl Pichon was at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport with his Ensemble Pygmalion orchestra and chorus on March 12, 2020, catching a plane to New York for his U.S. debut nine days later at the Park Avenue Armory in Monteverdi\u2019s \u201cMarian Vespers.\u201d",
      "First the flight was delayed. Then it was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cIn the middle of the night they closed the skies,\u201d the conductor said.",
      "His American debut was delayed until December 2021 with Boston\u2019s Handel and Haydn Society. He makes first New York appearance at age 40 on Thursday night, leading the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s in a program with baritone Christian Gerhaher and soprano Ying Fang titled \u201cMein Traum (My Dream)\u201d featuring works by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann and Carl Maria von Weber.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s really the future of classical music,\u201d said James Roe, the St. Luke\u2019s orchestra president. \u201cHe sees the potential of the concert experience in a way that\u2019s both expansive and welcoming and of the next generation. And he wants the concerts to propose a story, a narrative, an odyssey, a way of moving an audience member from their everyday life to something extraordinarily pleasurable.\u201d",
      "Rowe first met Pichon at the 2023 Salzburg Festival in Austria, where Pichon led a new production of Mozart\u2019s \u201cLe Nozze di Figaro \u201d by director Martin Ku\u0161ej that included cocaine-fueled fights and a predator priest. Pichon\u2019s wife, soprano Sabine Devieilhe, sang Susanna.",
      "\u201cI think, sadly, the stage director was in a very, very bad mood and a very difficult moment of his life, and, sadly, the consequences were big,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "The Vienna Philharmonic in the pit produced a different sound than the leaner approach Pichon is used to from Pygmalion\u2019s period instruments. As the Salzburg Festival\u2019s resident orchestra since 1922, the Vienna Philharmonic performs in numerous operas and concerts.",
      "\u201cSometimes 100% of the orchestra is changing from one night to the next night, so it could create some fantastic nights and some really banal moments, so it\u2019s really strange,\u201d Pichon said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s really music, but an amazing experience. Learned a lot. Never again. You understand many things about Salzburg, about Austrian culture, about Viennese culture, their role in this classical music world. It\u2019s really something, but it\u2019s a really strange philosophy. Vienna Philharmoniker \u2014 it\u2019s a society inside a society. It\u2019s a really strange world.\u201d",
      "Alex Fortes, a St. Luke\u2019s violin player, said Pichon made an immediate positive impression this week.",
      "\u201cHe has both an incredible clarity and a physical movement in terms of communicating what he wants,\u201d Fortes said, \u201cas well as incredibly eloquent and precise language to describe those things quite figuratively and beautifully that inspire the orchestra.\u201d",
      "Born in Brittany, Pichon played violin when he was young, started singing in a choir when he was 10 and gave that up for piano and harpsichord. He met Devieilhe while singing in a youth choir. They live together with their two young children in Paris\u2019 13th arrondissement, a unit combined from several apartments that is soundproofed, allowing each a piano to practice with.",
      "Gerhaher first encountered Devieilhe when they sang together at Munich\u2019s Bavarian State Opera last summer.",
      "\u201cShe was just absolutely outstanding and amazing and I thought, well, her husband must be equally brilliant. Otherwise they can\u2019t stay together,\u201d Gerhaher said with a laugh.",
      "Pichon founded Pygmalion in 2006. It performs 60-70 concerts per year, including at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, the Dutch National Opera and Paris\u2019 Op\u00e9ra-Comique, where Pichon conducted an opera with his wife for the first time, L\u00e9o Delibes\u2019 \u201cLakm\u00e9,\u201d in 2022. Pichon has commissioned a comic opera from French-Argentine composer Oscar Strasnoy to premiere there in 2027.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a bit tired with all these operas telling us (about) the end of the world and I wanted something really different and more corrosive and more comic and more sarcastic,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "While he is a Baroque specialist, he has listened to the British rock band Radiohead for two decades.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of parallels with classical music, because I\u2019m really so amazed by their ability to erase what they\u2019ve just done and try to explore each time a new world,\u201d Pichon said.",
      "He led the St. Luke\u2019s orchestra on Monday for a rehearsal at The DiMenna Center for Classical Music, in a windswept area of Manhattan near the Hudson River. The harshest cold snap of the winter had set in.",
      "\u201cThe music we are making is the biggest contrast from the weather we experienced outside,\u201d Fortes recalled Pichon saying. \u201cIt\u2019s full of warmth and fire and beauty.\u201d"

      "As many in the entertainment industry navigate the devastating effects of the California wildfires, some will soon be decamping to cleaner air in the mountains. The annual Sundance Film Festival begins Thursday in Park City, Utah.",
      "The 41st edition of Robert Redford\u2019s brainchild will, as always, be a year of discovery and discussion. There are timely films:",
      "\u2014 \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d which will premiere just days after former President Joe Biden commuted the sentence of the Indigenous activist nearly half a century after he was imprisoned for the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "\u2014 Oscar-winner Mstyslav Chernov\u2019s\u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and Frontline about an attempt to liberate an occupied territory in Ukraine",
      "\u2014 Several films about trans rights including \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about civil rights lawyer Chase Strangio. It's a topic even more pressing after President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "There are even some controversies brewing: \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d from documentary filmmaker Bao Nguyen, calls into question who took the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cNapalm Girl\u201d photograph. Retired AP photographer Nick Ut and the AP, which conducted a six-month investigation into the allegation, are contesting it vigorously and lawyers have asked for it to be pulled from the program.",
      "\u201cThe film is an investigation,\u201d said Eugene Hernandez, the director of the festival, who is moving forward with plans to screen it. \u201cI think it will be a really important conversation that will come out over the next few days after the film is seen by more people.\u201d",
      "Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not all heavy. There\u2019s drama of course, even a film about starting over after a fire (\u201cRebuilding,\u201d with Josh O\u2019Connor), horror, satire, literary adaptations, comedy, documentaries about famous faces, and some that simply defy categorization.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some really funny stuff in the program,\u201d Hernandez said. One of those Hernandez cited is \u201cBubble & Squeak,\u201d about a married couple accused of smuggling cabbages into a nation where they\u2019re banned.",
      "For first time filmmakers, Sundance can be their chance to break through in a big way. That happened last year for \u201cD\u00ecdi\u201d filmmaker Sean Wang. Some films that debuted last January are still in the awards conversation, like \u201cA Real Pain\u201d and \u201cA Different Man.\u201d For actors, the festival is both a casual respite to awards season glitz (snow boots are more likely on red carpets than high heels) and can be a chance to show audiences a new dimension of their talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a strong year of renewal for our artist community,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of really great voices and stories that we get to unveil in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s everything you need to know:",
      "Sundance runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2. There are about 90 features premiering across the 11 days, with screenings starting early in the morning through midnight. Award-winners will be announced on Jan. 31.",
      "Stars with films premiering include Jennifer Lopez, Benedict Cumberbatch, Diego Luna, Conan O\u2019Brien, Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Ayo Edebiri, Olivia Colman, Andr\u00e9 Holland, Steven Yeun, Mark Ruffalo, Bowen Yang, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Lily Gladstone, Dev Patel, Emily Watson, John Lithgow, Marlee Matlin, John Malkovich, Rose Byrne, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Josh O\u2019Connor, Ben Whishaw, Dylan O\u2019Brien, Lili Reinhart and Willem Dafoe.",
      "One of the greatest things about Sundance is that it\u2019s often the under-the-radar movies that become the breakouts.",
      "But some of the higher-profile premieres going into the festival include: Bill Condon\u2019s \u201cKiss of the Spider-Woman,\u201d starring Lopez; Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson\u2019s documentary \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genius)\u201d; \u201cOpus,\u201d a horror about the cult of celebrity with Edebiri and John Malkovich; Andrew Ahn\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d with Bowen Yang and Kelly Marie Tran; the war satire \u201cAtropia,\u201d with Alia Shawkat; \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d about the late Paul Reubens; \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore\u201d; and Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman\u2019s doc \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about a cover-up in one of America\u2019s most notorious prison systems.",
      "Festival organizers have been in dialogue with filmmakers, staff, audiences and donors about the effects of the fires, supporting and accommodating where possible including pushing back deadlines to allow filmmakers more time to finish. The festival will also have a QR code displayed before screenings for information on sharing resources or contributing to relief efforts.",
      "\u201cAs hard as the last week has been, this will be a moment to come together,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe community\u2019s really responding to support those who need it most right now. I think that\u2019s going to be a profound aspect of this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "For the most part, yes. Starting in 2027 the festival will no longer be primarily based in Park City. It may stay in Utah but would operate mainly out of Salt Lake City. Other finalists are Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Sundance Institute is expected to announce its final decision in the first quarter of 2025.",
      "\u201cPark City as the home of Sundance is such a special place,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI look at it optimistically because we have two more exciting years in this current configuration. I think we\u2019re going to make the most of those two years and make them as memorable and meaningful as we can.\u201d",
      "Access to the movies premiering at Sundance doesn\u2019t necessary require an expensive trip to Park City anymore. The festival has fully embraced an online component for many of their films.",
      "What started as a necessary COVID-19 adjustment has become a vital part of the program. From Jan. 30 through Feb. 2, audiences can stream much of the program online. Prices start at $35 for a single film ticket and go up to $800 for unlimited access.",
      "Otherwise, films that secure distribution can take anywhere from a few weeks to over a year to hit theaters or streaming services. Steven Soderbergh's \u201cPresence,\u201d which premiered last January, is just hitting theaters this week.",

      "NEW YORK -- An estimated 24.6 million television viewers watched President Donald Trump's second inauguration, the smallest audience for the quadrennial ceremony since Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013.",
      "The Nielsen Company said Tuesday that viewership was down from Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration, which reached 33.8 million, and Trump's first move into the White House, seen by 30.6 million in 2017.",
      "Inauguration viewership has varied widely over the past half-century, from a high of 41.8 million when Ronald Reagan came into office in 1981 to a low of 15.5 million for the start of George W. Bush's second term in 2004.",
      "The length of Trump's inauguration coverage may have hurt him in bragging rights. The 24.6 million figure represents the average number of people tuning in to coverage on one of 15 networks between 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Eastern. In past years, the coverage didn't go on for so long, which meant the averages were likely higher because people tune away as the day goes on.",
      "Nielsen had no immediate estimate, for example, of how many people watched Trump up until 4 p.m. Eastern, the cutoff point for most inauguration coverage in the past.",
      "There's no doubt where most viewers gravitated on Monday: Fox News Channel had 10.3 million viewers between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m., when Trump was sworn in and gave his inaugural speech. In that same period, ABC had 4.7 million viewers, NBC had 4.4 million, CBS had 4.1 million, CNN had 1.7 million and MSNBC had 848,000, Nielsen said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two years after her shocking decision to resign as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is set to publish a memoir.",
      "Crown, a division of Penguin Random House, announced Tuesday that Ardern's \u201cA Different Kind of Power\" is scheduled for June 3. Only 37 when elected in 2017, Ardern will reflect on some of the decisions and events that made her known worldwide. She was widely praised for her compassionate response to the 2019 terrorist attacks against two mosques in Christchurch and for her initial handing of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cSome people thought kindness was sentimental, soft. A bit naive, even. I knew this. But I also knew they were wrong,\" Ardern said in a statement. \"Kindness has a power and strength that almost nothing else on this planet has. I\u2019d seen kindness do extraordinary things \u2014 I\u2019d seen it give people hope, I\u2019d seen it change minds, and transform live. Kindness. This was my guiding principle, and it would be the trait with which I would try to lead, no matter what lay ahead.\u201d",
      "By early 2023, the coronavirus was spreading, and resistance was growing to her zero-tolerance policy of mandates and other restrictions which had helped keep the pandemic out of New Zealand. With her popularity fading, Ardern stunned many supporters by deciding to leave, saying she no longer had \u201cenough in the tank.\u201d In June 2023, she was made a Dame Grand Companion, the second-highest honor in New Zealand, as part of King Charles III\u2019s Birthday Honors. Around the same time, Ardern posted on Instagram that she was working on a book, one more focused on leadership than on \u201cinternal politics.\u201d",
      "Crown is calling her book a \u201cdeeply personal and inspiring memoir\u201d that offers \u201cArdern\u2019s unfiltered journey, from tenacious girl in small-town New Zealand to a trailblazing world leader who became the world\u2019s youngest female head of government, and only the second in history to give birth while in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cArdern changed the world\u2019s expectations of what a global leader can be. With remarkable candor, she shares the pivotal moments that defined her leadership and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the details behind her decision to step down during her sixth year as Prime Minister,\" Crown announced."

      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about how many people are in the audience,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t get too nervous. I mostly get excited.\u201d",
      "Dressed in colorful outfits and their hair often tied in buns, the dancers ages 9 to 19 mingled about as they waited to take the stage. One after another in rapid-fire succession, they were called out by their number and performed solos lasting several minutes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see all the hard work that these kids do. Dance is often thought of as a sport that maybe is light. But these kids work so, so hard each and every day, putting in 20, 30 hours a week,\"said Ana Canelos, of North Falmouth. She called it a \u201cmagnificent\u201d opportunity to see her 16-year-old and 10-year-old daughters perform along with others.",
      "\u201cTo compete with just the caliber of individuals who are here, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she added.",
      "Organizers said about 1,200 dancers will be chosen from the 32 auditions held in the U.S. and the 14 worldwide to compete in the finals in April in Tampa, Florida. Thousands of scholarships will be offered at the auditions and also the finals. The scholarships provide opportunities for short-term, summer, or year-round study at leading dance schools and programs worldwide.",
      "\u201cIt's an incredible opportunity for these dancers to be seen by the directors of schools and companies in the U.S and abroad,\u201d said Racheal Nye, the director of school and studio company at the Oklahoma City Ballet.",
      "Over the past 25 years, Youth America Grand Prix has awarded $5 million in scholarships to the world\u2019s leading dance schools, with about $450,000 now given out each year."

    "story": [
      "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem. But the singer\u2019s participation in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides, where mainstream entertainers, from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly and more enthusiastically associating with the new administration.",
      "Eight years ago, Trump reportedly struggled to enlist stars to be part of the swearing-in and the various glitzy balls that follow. The concurrent protest marches around the nation had more famous entertainers than the swearing-in, which stood in stark contrast to someone like Barack Obama, whose second inaugural ceremony had performances from Beyonc\u00e9, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson and a series of starry onlookers.",
      "There were always some celebrity Trump supporters, like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Jon Voight, Rosanne Barr, Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman, to name a few. But Trump\u2019s victory this time around was decisive and while Hollywood may always skew largely liberal, the slate of names participating in his inauguration weekend events has improved.",
      "Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include the rapper Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw.",
      "\u201cThe people who are coming out and participating directly are still a small subset of the entire universe of what we call celebrity,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a lot more celebrities who are coming out and supporting Trump. There may not be that distinct division that we saw before.\u201d",
      "Even some who have publicly criticized Trump in the past seem to have changed course. One of the highest-profile examples is the rapper Snoop Dogg, who in a 2017 music video pretended to shoot a Trump lookalike, and then this weekend performed at a pre-Inaugural event called The Crypto Ball. When a social media user posted a video of his performance, his name quickly became a trending topic on social media with a fair amount of disbelief and outrage.",
      "There may still be a tinge of stigma, however. Thompson pointed to the statement from The Village People, in which they offered a justification for their involvement, which he likened to an apologia.",
      "Also, Thompson said, \u201cthe idea of being featured in a big national civic ritual perhaps can transcend political identity.\u201d",
      "The participation of people like Underwood is not going to change anyone\u2019s mind about Trump, Thompson said. It could, however, change minds about the artist. On social media, some declared they were going to delete Underwood\u2019s songs from their playlists.",
      "Where Trump once emphasized the otherness of a Hollywood that largely shunned him, he\u2019s now turned his attention back to the entertainment capital as a project to be saved. He named Stallone, Voight and Mel Gibson as his chosen \u201cambassadors\u201d for the mission. Thompson said it sounds like an Onion headline or something on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d That, or a logline for the latest installment in the \u201cExpendables\u201d franchise.",
      "Following the election, celebrity detractors have also been quieter than in 2017, when nationwide marches brought out the likes of Cher, Madonna, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys and Janelle Monae. The People\u2019s March in D.C. on Saturday did not boast about any celebrity participants. At the Golden Globe Awards in early January, Trump\u2019s name was not mentioned on stage -\u2013 a stark contrast to 2017, when Meryl Streep used her lifetime achievement award speech to decry the president-elect before his first term began.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gone through these processes, and it turned out that none of it ever made any bit of difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAll of this celebrity talking against Trump and all of the celebrities going for (Joe) Biden and speaking about the future of democracy not only didn\u2019t make any difference toward the outcome of the election, but one could argue that it actually meant that things moved in the other direction.\u201d",
      "On Friday night in D.C., the nonpartisan nonprofit The Creative Coalition brought together some actors to raise money for and celebrate organizations that support military service members and their families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of things that are nonpartisan, nonpolitical,\u201d said comedian Jeff Ross. \u201cI talk smack for a living and I\u2019m a big believer in free speech. The military protects my right.\u201d",
      "The entertainers stayed largely focused on the event at hand, not the incoming administration, although they did express concern about funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.",
      "\u201cThe NEA has always been in peril, regardless of what administration comes in. But it feels like the incoming administration will probably be more aggressive in cutting down funding for the arts,\u201d said actor Steven Weber. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s an essential component not only in our education, but in the life blood of this culture.\u201d",
      "One Monday event will have a bit of celebrity counterprogramming \u2014 the Concert for America, not as protest but as fundraiser for wildfire relief which will be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles and livestreamed to the world. Participants include Jon Cryer, Lisa Joyner, Conan O\u2019Brien, Julie Bowen, Adam Scott, Wayne Brady and Rosie Perez. In addition to performances and comedy, it will also highlight organizations dedicated to protecting human rights.",
      "Producers Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley Jackson started the event in 2017, also held on Inauguration Day, to raise money for organizations and non-profits they thought would need help over the next four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only to give people a call to action, but also to give them hope, inspiration and to feel connected,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "They didn\u2019t have trouble recruiting entertainers to participate, Jackson said. The only ones who declined did so because they were working.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a counter effort,\u201d Rudetsky said. \u201cI see it as a way to get rid of the annoying rhetoric and the hate that\u2019s based on nothing. It\u2019s about unity.\u201d"

      "A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park",
      "CHESSY, France -- A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park, as a raft of ambitious developments comes to fruition under a 2 billion euro ($2.05 billion) expansion plan.",
      "The overhaul includes the completed revamp of the luxury Disneyland Hotel, the upcoming renaming and doubling in size of Walt Disney Studios Park, and the much-anticipated arrival of The World of Frozen and a first-of-its-kind The Lion King land \u2014 cementing the resort\u2019s gains after the wilderness years for theme parks during the pandemic.",
      "Disney Tales of Magic was unveiled this month. It's a dazzling 20-minute spectacle blending drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections and ultra-bright lasers.",
      "\u201cFor the very first time, not only will we be projecting onto Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, but also Main Street USA,\u201d said Tim Lutkin, artistic director of the production, referring to the park\u2019s main commercial artery lined with boutiques and merchandise.",
      "The show\u2019s standout feature \u2014 ultra-bright lasers \u2014 has been used only once before, at the Paris 2024 Olympics at the Eiffel Tower during the iconic opening ceremony that featured a performance with Celine Dion. The lasers, which travel 23 miles (37 kilometers), deliver extraordinary power while remaining safe near crowds.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\u201d said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris.",
      "Featuring Disney and Pixar tales brought to life by drone-made 3D figures, synchronized fountains and a 100-piece orchestra, the show is elevated further by the original anthem \u201cLive in Magic.\u201d",
      "Audiences have been awestruck. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous. We\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful light show,\u201d said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting with her family. \u201cIt gave me goosebumps,\u201d added Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid. \u201cThe combination of music, lights, and the drones felt like pure magic. I\u2019ve been to Disney before, but this show is on another level.\u201d",
      "The spectacle also reflects Disney\u2019s storytelling evolution. Lutkin noted the shift from classic ballgown tales to modern narratives like \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which delves into deeper themes such as anxiety and depression. The latter\u2019s unexpected box office success, Lutkin said, proved that \u201cthe world and its relationship with Disney are ready to embrace more complex stories.\u201d This shift is mirrored in the show\u2019s selection of movies, spanning Disney\u2019s timeless classics and emotionally resonant modern hits.",
      "At the heart of Disneyland Paris\u2019 expansion is the transformation of Walt Disney Studios Park, doubling in size and reimagined as Disney Adventure World. Opening in spring 2025, a new park entrance, World Premiere, will greet visitors with the glamour of a Hollywood film premiere, leading them into immersive themed areas.",
      "\u201cThese projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\u201d said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen it as Europe\u2019s top tourist destination.",
      "Already Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park and France\u2019s top tourist attraction outdrawing the Louvre, Disneyland Paris welcomed over 10 million visitors in 2023.",
      "The expansion includes two eagerly awaited themed lands. The World of Frozen, debuting in 2026, will transport guests to Arendelle with a central lake hosting water performances and the Frozen Ever After boat ride, alongside themed dining, shopping, and accommodations. Meanwhile, The Lion King land will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with beloved characters like Simba and Timon.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic delivered one the toughest challenges to Disneyland Paris, as with all resort parks around the world, forcing an eight-month closure in 2020 and another in 2021.",
      "But Disney doubled down.",
      "The ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion is part of a $60 billion global investment announced in September 2023, aiming to redefine Disney parks, cruises and attractions over the next decade.",
      "A centerpiece of the Paris overhaul is the revamped Disneyland Hotel, with suites themed around classic Disney royalty.",
      "Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 under its original name, Euro Disney Resort. Situated just outside Paris in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, it marked Disney\u2019s first foray into Europe. However, the park\u2019s early years were fraught with challenges, including cultural missteps, financial struggles and lower-than-expected visitor numbers. Critics in France derided it as an American cultural invasion, dubbing it a \u201ccultural Chernobyl.\u201d",
      "To reverse its fortunes, the park underwent significant rebranding, changing its name to Disneyland Paris in 1994 to emphasize its French location and connection to the capital. Over time, strategic changes, including the addition of new attractions and a shift in marketing, helped the resort recover. It is now a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s global operations."

      "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions for Americans over the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids",
      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year\u2019s are comparable to battlefield injuries",
      "HONOLULU -- Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year's are comparable to battlefield injuries, the doctor overseeing their care said Friday.",
      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green earlier this week proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant smuggling of illegal fireworks."

      "Taiwan plans to cull up to 120,000 green iguanas, with supporters urging humane methods to bring down the animal's population, which is wreaking havoc on the island's agricultural sector",
      "PINGTUNG, Taiwan -- Taiwan plans to cull up to 120,000 green iguanas, with supporters urging humane methods to bring down the animal's population, which is wreaking havoc on the island's agricultural sector.",
      "Around 200,000 of the reptiles are believed to be in the island's southern and central areas, which are heavily dependent on farming, according Chiu Kuo-hao of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency.",
      "Specially recruited hunting teams killed about 70,000 iguanas last year, with bounties of up to $15 each. Local governments have asked the public to help identify iguana nests and they recommend fishing spears as the most humane means of killing the animals.",
      "\u201cA lot of people bought them as cute little pets, not realizing how big and long-lived they would become, so they set them free in the wild, where they\u2019ve really taken to the Taiwanese environment,\u201d said Lee Chi-ya of the agricultural department in the southern county of Pingtung. \u201cThat's allowed them to reproduce at a considerable rate, necessitating us to cull them and restore the balance of nature.\"",
      "Green iguanas have no natural predators in Taiwan and have moved into areas that can be difficult to access, mostly forests and the edges of towns.",
      "Males can grow to 2 feet (6.6 feet) long, weigh 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and live up to 20 years, while females can lay up to 80 eggs at a time.",
      "Mainly native to Central America and the Caribbean, they are not aggressive despite possessing sharp tails and jaws and razor-like teeth. The reptiles subsist on a diet of mostly fruit, leaves and plants, with the occasional small animal thrown in.",
      "Though popular as pets, they are difficult to keep healthy in captivity and many die within a year.",
      "Hsu Wei-chieh, secretary general of the Reptile Conservation Association of Taiwan, said his group wants to teach farmers how to stay safe, protect their property and treat the iguanas in a humane manner.",
      "\u201cWe're here to help see that this project is carried out smoothly,\u201d said Hsu.",
      "Tsai Po-wen, a vegetable farmer in Pingtung, said the training was paying off.",
      "\u201cWe used to attack them, but it wasn't any use. Now we're learning more effective, safer methods,\u201d Tsai said.",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's opposition said Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation.",
      "The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order \u201cunlawful and offensive content\u201d blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social media",
      "Social media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.",

      "The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.",
      "Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.",
      "The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could \u201clay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights\u201d.",
      "The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.",
      "Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the \u201cfounder of the PTI\" party.",
      "Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.",
      "Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.",
      "The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation."

    "story": [
      "An endangered tropical plant that emits the stench of a rotting corpse during its rare blooms has begun to flower in a greenhouse in Sydney, Australia",
      "SYDNEY, Australia -- The rare unfurling of an endangered plant that emits the smell of decaying flesh drew hundreds of devoted fans to a greenhouse in Sydney, Australia on Thursday, where they lined up to experience a momentous bloom -\u2013 and a fragrance evoking gym socks and rotting garbage.",
      "Tall, pointed and smelly, the corpse flower is scientifically known as amorphophallus titanum \u2014 or bunga bangkai in Indonesia, where the plants are found in the Sumatran rainforest.",
      "But to fans of this specimen, she\u2019s Putricia -- a portmanteau of \u201cputrid\u201d and \u201cPatricia\u201d eagerly adopted by her followers who, naturally, call themselves Putricians. For a week, she has graced a stately and gothic display in front of a purple curtain and wreathed in mist from a humidifier at the Royal Sydney Botanic Garden.",
      "Her rise to fame since has been rapid, with more than 13,000 admirers filing past for a moment in her increasingly pungent presence. No corpse flower has bloomed at the garden for 15 years.",
      "The plant only flowers every 7-10 years in the wild.",
      "\u201cThe fact that they open very rarely, so they flower rarely, is obviously something that puts them at a little bit of a disadvantage in the wild,\u201d said garden spokesperson Sophie Daniel, who designed Putricia's kooky and funereal display. \u201cWhen they open, they have to hope that another flower is open nearby, because they can\u2019t self-pollinate.\u201d",
      "There are thought to be only 300 of the plants in the wild and fewer than 1,000 worldwide \u2014 including those in cultivation. Among them is Putricia, which arrived at the garden seven years ago.",
      "When her flower was spotted in December she was just 25 centimeters (10 inches) high. By Thursday, she was 1.6 meters (5 feet 3 inches) tall -\u2013 and her flower spike was slowly opening like a pleated skirt around a majestic central tuber, the yellow-green outer curling to reveal a burgundy center.",
      "As excitement grew in Sydney about the moment of her bloom, garden staff erected crowd barriers, giving the Victorian greenhouse the air of a rock concert. Fans trod a red carpet to view Putricia from behind velvet ropes in a display inspired by Queen Victoria\u2019s funeral, the Rocky Horror Picture Show and the oeuvre of the late director David Lynch.",
      "Inside, fans took selfies and leaned in for a sniff \u2014 an increasingly perilous prospect as Putricia's odor developed. One young woman raised her hands and bowed as though in worship. On social media, garden staff performed a viral dance to Chappell Roan\u2019s summer hit HOT TO GO! against a backdrop of the stately plant.",
      "It was difficult to say why the regal, mysterious and stinky flower had attracted such a following -\u2013 but perhaps the answer lay in the \u201creverence\u201d viewers felt in the presence of \u201csuch an amazing living being,\u201d Daniel said.",
      "Along with her real-life visitors, Putricia\u2019s online fandom has been rapid, global and deeply strange -\u2013 if much less smelly. A 24/7 live stream established by the botanic garden drew close to a million views in less than a week and a shared language of memes and inside jokes sprang up.",
      "Frequently deployed acronyms included WWTF, or we watch the flower, WDNRP -- we do not rush Putricia \u2013 and BBTB, or blessed be the bloom. \u201cPutricia is a metaphor for my life,\u201d wrote one poster, who did not elaborate.",
      "Commenters on social media made plans to hurry to the garden as the plant opened. In just 24 hours, Putricia\u2019s bloom -\u2013 and her stench -\u2013 would be gone.",
      "As she unfurled, Putricia would heat to 37 degrees Celsius (100 F) to better spread her scent, Daniel said, attracting flies and carrion beetles to burrow inside and lay eggs. Then, work will begin to hand-pollinate the plant in efforts to ensure the species' diversity and survival.",
      "But first, thousands of Putricians will attempt to get as close as they can to their hero of a week.",
      "\u201cWe did have a few conversations early on about whether or not we should have vomit bags in the room,\" said Daniel, adding that garden staff ultimately decided against it. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of anyone actually being harmed.\"",

      "ROME -- Amanda Knox has a final shot at clearing her name of the last vestige of criminal wrongdoing when Italy\u2019s highest court on Thursday hears her appeal of a slander conviction for falsely accusing a Congolese bar owner in the 2007 murder of her British flatmate.",
      "But the innocent man she accused, Patrick Lumbumba, told reporters outside Italy's Cassation Court that he hopes the conviction stands and \u201cstays with her for the rest of her life.\u201d",
      "The ruling should bring an end to a sensational 17-year legal saga that saw Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend convicted and acquitted in flip-flop verdicts in 21-year-old Meredith Kercher\u2019s brutal murder, before being exonerated by the highest Cassation Court in 2015.",
      "The slander conviction against Knox remained the last legal stain against her. It survived multiple appeals, and Knox was reconvicted on the charge in June after a European court ruling that Italy had violated her human rights cleared the way for a new trial.",
      "Amanda is watching the verdict at home \u201cconfident and respectful of the justice system as she always has been. She is confident that this story will end today,\u201d her defense lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told reporters.",
      "Knox said recently on her \u201cLabyrinths\u201d podcast that \u201cI hate the fact that I have to live consequences for a crime I did not commit.\u201d",
      "Her defense team says she accused Lumumba, who employed her at a bar in the central Italian university town of Perugia, during a long night of questioning and under pressure from police, who they said fed her false information. The European Court of Human Rights found that the police deprived her of a lawyer and provided a translator who acted more as a mediator.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been having nightmares about getting a bad verdict and just living the rest of my life with a shadow hanging over me. It\u2019s like a scarlet letter,\u2019\u2019 Knox said on her podcast.",
      "Even if the high court upholds the conviction and three-year sentence, Knox does not risk any more time she jail. She has already served nearly four years during the investigation, initial murder trial and first appeal. Knox said the aim is to clear her name of all criminal wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cLiving with a false conviction is horrific, personally, psychologically, emotionally,'' she said on the podcast. \u201cI'm fighting it, and we'll see what happens.\u201d",
      "Knox returned to the United States in 2011, after being freed by an appeals court in Perugia, and has established herself as a global campaigner for the wrongly convicted. She has a podcast with her husband and has a new memoir coming out titled, \u201cFree: My Search for Meaning.\u201d",
      "Knox returned to Italy in June for the verdict in the slander trial, and Dalla Vedova said at the time that she was \u201cvery embittered\u201d by the conviction.",
      "Knox was a 20-year-old student in the central Italian university town of Perugia when Kercher was found stabbed to death on Nov. 2, 2007, in her bedroom in the apartment they shared with two Italian women.",
      "The case made global headlines as suspicion quickly fell on Knox and her boyfriend of just days, Rafaelle Sollecito. After eight years of trial, including two appeals to Italy\u2019s highest court, they were fully exonerated in the murder in 2015.",
      "Another man, Rudy Hermann Guede of the Ivory Coast, was convicted of murder after his DNA was found at the crime scene. He was freed in 2021, after serving most of his 16-year sentence.",
      "The European court ordered Italy to pay Knox damages for the police failures, noting she was particularly vulnerable as a foreign student not fluent in Italian.",
      "Italy\u2019s high court ordered the new slander trial based on that ruling. It threw out two signed statements drafted by police falsely accusing Lumumba in the murder, and directed the appellate court that the only evidence it could consider was a hand-written letter she later wrote in English attempting to walk back the accusation.",
      "However, the appellate court in its reasoning said that the four-page memo supported a slander finding.",
      "On the basis of Knox's statements, Lumumba was brought in for questioning, despite having an ironclad alibi. His business suffered, and he eventually moved to Poland with his Polish wife.",
      "Arriving at court, he underlined that Knox \u201chas never apologized to me.\u201d",

      "Axel Rudakubana, 18, faces a sentencing hearing Thursday at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England over the July 29 attack, which devastated the seaside town of Southport, shocked the country and set off both street violence and soul-searching.",
      "The crime triggered anti-immigrant rioting and has led the government to reconsider its definition of terrorism, its approach to online radicalization and the way information about criminal suspects is made public.",
      "Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder, 10 of attempted murder for those he injured, and additional charges of possessing a knife, the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on all charges on Monday \u2013 sparing victims\u2019 families a lengthy trial, but also potentially robbing them of answers.",
      "Prosecutors plan to set out their case against Rudakubana in detail during Thursday\u2019s hearing, with relatives of the victims watching in court.",
      "The attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when two dozen little girls were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana, armed with a knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher.",
      "He killed Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. Eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, were wounded, along with instructor Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, who worked in a business next door and intervened.",
      "The killings in the northwest England town triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K. Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack, and alleged that police and the government were withholding information.",
      "Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales to Christian parents from Rwanda, and investigators have not been able to pin down his motivation.",
      "In the years before the attack he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told lawmakers on Tuesday that Rudakubana \u201cwas convicted of a violent assault against another child at school\u201d and had multiple contacts with children\u2019s social care, mental health services and police, who were called to his home over his behavior five times between 2019 and 2022. He was referred three times to the government\u2019s anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14.",
      "All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed.",
      "The government has declared the case a wake-up call. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it must lead to \u201cfundamental change\u201d in the way the state protects its citizens, announcing a public inquiry into the failures that allowed Rudakubana to carry out his rampage with a knife he had ordered from Amazon.",
      "He said laws might need updating to combat a \u201cnew threat\u201d from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism, \u201cacts of extreme violence carried out by loners, misfits, young men in their bedrooms.\u201d",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service has defended the decision not to disclose details before Rudakubana went to court, saying \u201creleasing that information earlier would have put the trial at risk.\u201d U.K. contempt of court laws limit what can be reported before trial, in the interests of preventing jury bias."

      "Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",

The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Trump\u2019s call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first reported abroad.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",

      "Mexico was raising sprawling tents on the U.S. border Wednesday as it braced for President Donald Trump to fulfill his pledge to reverse mass migration",
      "CIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico -- Mexico raised sprawling tents on the U.S. border Wednesday as it braced for President Donald Trump to fulfill his pledge to carry out mass deportations.",
      "In an empty lot tight against the border with El Paso, Texas, cranes lifted metal frames for tent shelters in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "Enrique Serrano, an official in Chihuahua state, where Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez is located, said the tents erected for Mexican deportees were just the initial phase of a potential larger operation, and something authorities would scale up if the number of migrants gathering on the border continued to mount. He suggested migrants from other countries expelled from the U.S. would be relocated to Mexico City or southern regions of Mexico as they've done previously.",
      "Nogales, Mexico \u2014 across from Nogales, Arizona \u2014 announced that it would build shelters on soccer fields and in a gymnasium. The border cities of Matamoros and Piedras Negras have launched similar efforts.",
      "At a border crossing in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday night, one man shouted to journalists that he was being deported in a group that was arrested that morning in farm fields near Denver. Another man said he was in a group that had been brought from Oregon. Everyone carried their belongings in a small orange bag.",
      "Neither man's account could be independently confirmed.",
      "The number of people deported Tuesday was lower than the daily average of about 500 last year, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum noted at her daily press briefing. And many border shelters that have long offered refuge to migrants remained comparatively empty to the soaring levels of migrants seen just a year before.",
      "Still, heads of those migrant shelters like Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garcia, director of the Tijuana shelter Movimiento Juventud 2000 were bracing for what could come.",
      "\u201cMass deportations in the United States and the arrival of thousands of migrants from the south could overwhelm the city of Tijuana and other border cities, creating a crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Though quickly ramping up deportations \u2014 as Trump pledges \u2014 faces logistical and financial challenges.",
      "The Mexican government is building nine shelters in border cities to receive deportees. It has said that it would also use existing facilities in Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez and Matamoros, to take in migrants whose appointments to request asylum in the U.S. were canceled on Inauguration Day.",
      "Sheinbaum has said that Mexico will give humanitarian aid to migrants from other countries whose asylum appointments were cancelled, as well as those sent to wait in her nation under the revived policy known as Remain in Mexico. Mexico wants to eventually and voluntarily return them to their nations, she has said.",
      "Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente and the new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held their first telephone conversation in their new positions.",
      "\u201cIt was a very good conversation, very cordial, they talked about migration and security issues,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "After pledging to dramatically shift border and immigration policies, on Monday Trump scrapped the program known as CBP One that allowed asylum seekers to schedule appointments on their phones before arriving at the border, providing a degree of order. On Wednesday, the Pentagon announced it was sending up to 1,500 active-duty troops to the border.",
      "Meanwhile, Garcia, the head of the Tijuana migrant shelter, said there were discussions underway about how to help border cities prepare for what they expect will be an influx of people. The Mexican government has also said it will bus some deportees to their homes in Mexico\u2019s interior, and would also provide deported migrants with cards of 2,000 pesos, or about $100, upon arrival at the border to cover their basic needs.",
      "In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Rev. Juan Fierro, head of the Good Samaritan shelter, was also preparing for change.",
      "In recent years he has seen the shelter\u2019s population change from young men crossing a wall-less border for work to families seeking asylum, migration ebbing and flowing with political shifts in the U.S. During Trump\u2019s first term, the policy of making asylum seekers wait out the U.S. process in Mexico meant that people stayed at the shelter much longer, up to three years, Fierro said.",
      "Now he\u2019s getting ready for a new wave.",
      "\u201cThis shelter doesn\u2019t have the budget, we\u2019re practically day to day,\u201d Fierro said.",
      "His shelter houses 180 people and can feed around 50, he said. With significantly lower migration numbers over the past year, he only had a fraction of that number this week and is worried about an expected rise, especially since he hopes to give deportees a couple of months to consider their options: returning home, looking for work in another Mexican state or attempting to re-enter the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe people who want to make it to the United States are going to look for a way to do it,\" he said.",

      "Greece\u2019s coast guard said Wednesday that a passing Philippines-flagged tanker had rescued 29 people found on a boat 65 nautical miles (120 kilometers, 75 miles) south of the southern island of Crete. Another 45 people were rescued overnight by a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship 42 nautical miles (78 kilometers, 49 miles) south of the tiny island of Gavdos.",

      "Police in Greece say a marble statue of a woman believed to be more than 2,000 years old has been found abandoned in a garbage bag and handed to archaeologists",
      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- A marble statue of a woman believed to be more than 2,000 years old was found abandoned in a garbage bag near the Greek city of Thessaloniki, police said Wednesday.",
      "A resident discovered the 80-centimeter (31-inch) headless statue beside a trash bin in Neoi Epivates, outside Greece\u2019s second-largest city. The man turned it over to local authorities, who contacted archaeologists to assess its significance.",
      "Police said experts, following an initial evaluation, determined the piece dates to the Hellenistic era, a period roughly between 320 and 30 B.C. that was marked by a flourishing of art and culture following the conquests of Alexander the Great.",
      "The statue was sent for further examination by archaeologists. It will ultimately be handed over to the local antiquities authority for preservation and study. Police opened an investigation to determine who discarded the statue and briefly detained a man for questioning who was later released without charge. Accidental archaeological discoveries are relatively common in Greece, a country renowned for its ancient heritage, and often made during building construction or public works. In December, workers installing natural gas pipelines near Athens uncovered a Roman-era statue of Hermes buried upright in a brick-lined pit near the Acropolis. Thessaloniki weeks ago unveiled a trove of antiquities found during the decades-long construction of its metro system, which officially opened in November. Key finds, including a marble-paved Roman thoroughfare and tens of thousands of artifacts spanning the Greek, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods, are now showcased at subway stations.",

      "Italian opposition lawmakers and human rights groups are voicing outrage after Italy released a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court",
      "ROME -- Italian opposition lawmakers and human rights groups voiced outrage Wednesday after Italy released a Libyan warlord on a technicality, after he was arrested on a warrant from the International Criminal Court accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "Justice Minister Carlo Nordio was grilled about the release Tuesday of Ossama Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, during a previously scheduled appearance before the Senate. Nordio didn\u2019t respond to several requests for details about the release or demands that he reaffirm Italy\u2019s commitment to upholding international justice.",
      "Al-Masri heads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Defense Force. The ICC warrant, dated Jan. 18 and referenced in Italian court papers, accuses him of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Mitiga prison in Libya starting in 2011, punishable with life in prison.",
      "Al-Masri was arrested Sunday in Turin, where he reportedly had attended the Juventus-Milan soccer match the night before.",
      "Rome\u2019s court of appeals ordered him freed Tuesday, and he was sent back to Libya aboard an aircraft of the Italian secret services, because of what the appeals court said was a procedural error in his arrest. The ruling said Nordio should have been informed ahead of time of the arrest, since the justice ministry handles all relations with The Hague-based court.",
      "Al-Masri returned to Tripoli late Tuesday. He was received at the Mitiga airport by supporters who celebrated his release, according to local media. Footage circulated online showed dozens of young men chanting and carrying what appeared to be al-Masri on their shoulders at the airport.",
      "Opposition lawmakers from several parties voiced outrage and demanded clarity, with former Premier Matteo Renzi accusing the right-wing government of hypocrisy given its stated crackdown on human traffickers.",
      "\u201cBut when a trafficker whom the International Criminal Court tells us is a dangerous criminal lands on your table, it\u2019s not like you chase him down, you brought him home to Libya with a plane of the Italian secret services,\u201d said Renzi of the Italia Viva party. \u201cEither you\u2019re sick or this is the image of a hypocritical, indecent government.\u201d",
      "The Democratic Party demanded Premier Giorgia Meloni respond specifically to parliament about the case, saying it raised \u201cgrave questions\u201d given the known abuses in Libyan prisons for which Al-Masri is accused.",
      "Italy has close ties to the internationally recognized government in Tripoli and any trial in The Hague of al-Masri could bring unwanted attention to Italy\u2019s migration policies and its support of the Libyan coast guard, which it has financed to prevent migrants from leaving.",
      "Human rights groups have documented gross abuses in the Libyan detention facilities where migrants are kept, and have accused Italy of being complicit in their mistreatment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to understand why al-Masri was in Italy and why he was freed with such urgency despite the international arrest warrant,\u201d said the Democratic lawmaker Paolo Ciani. He said the choice \u201cappeared to be political.\"",
      "Another senator noted that the plane sent to retrieve al-Masri was sent to Turin before the Rome appeals court had even ruled, suggesting the decision to send him home had been already made by Meloni's office, which is responsible for the Italian secret services.",
      "Two humanitarian groups, Mediterranea Saving Humans and Refugees in Libya, which have documented abuses committed against migrants in Libyan detention facilities, said they were incredulous that Italy let al-Masri go.",
      "\u201cThose of us who managed to survive had believed that it was really possible not only to get justice, but more importantly to prevent this criminal from still acting undisturbed,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cInstead, in recent days we have witnessed something shameful, unbelievable in how brazenly it has been conducted.\u201d",
      "But Tarik Lamloum, a Libyan activist working with the Belaady Organization for Human Rights which focuses on migrants in Libya, said Italy\u2019s release of al-Masri was expected. He said his release shows the power of militias who control the flow of migrants to Europe through Libya\u2019s shores.",
      "\u201cTripoli militias are able to pressure (Italy) because they control the migrants file,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "Militias in western Libya are part of the official state forces tasked with intercepting migrants at sea, including in the EU-trained coast guard. They also run state detention centers, where abuses of migrants are common.",
      "As a result, militias \u2014 some of them led by warlords the U.N. has sanctioned for abuses \u2014 benefit from millions in funds the European Union gives to Libya to stop the migrant flow to Europe.",
      "The ICC prosecutor\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The European Commission spokesman reaffirmed all EU members had pledged to cooperate with the court.",
      "\u201cWe respect the court\u2019s impartiality and we are fully attached to international criminal justice to combat impunity,\" said EU commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni. In a 2023 summit, the EU leaders committed \u201cto cooperate fully with the court, including rapid execution of any pending arrests,\u201d he added.",

      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels said Wednesday they released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The move by the Iranian-backed Houthis marks their latest effort to de-escalate their attacks following a ceasefire in Gaza. It also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump likely weighs whether to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group that had been revoked by President Joe Biden.",
      "The rebels said they released the sailors after mediation by Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula that's long been an interlocutor with the Houthis. Oman did not immediately acknowledge the release, though an Omani Royal Air Force jet took a flight to Yemen earlier Wednesday and took off again about an hour after the Houthi announcement.",
      "The Houthis also said Hamas separately requested the release of the ship's crew of 25, who included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico.",
      "\u201cThis step comes in support of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza,\u201d the Houthis said in a statement on rebel-controlled SABA news agency.",
      "The Houthi rebels said they hijacked the Galaxy Leader over its connection to Israel. They then had a campaign targeting ships in international waters, which only stopped with the recent ceasefire in Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "A representative for the Galaxy Leader's owners had no immediate comment on Wednesday.",
      "The Bahamas-flagged vessel is affiliated with an Israeli billionaire Abraham \u201cRami\u201d Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel.",
      "The Houthi attack on the Galaxy Leader saw the rebels launched a helicopter-borne raid. Propaganda footage of the raid has been played constantly by the Houthis, who even shot a music video aboard the ship at one point.",
      "On Monday, the Houthis signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip, but warned wider assaults could resume if needed.",
      "However, it likely won\u2019t be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that\u2019s crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.",
      "The release of the vessel's crew now may be an effort to curry favor with the U.S., though the ship still remains moored off the Yemeni port city of Hodeida.",
      "\u201cThis gesture by the Houthis may be intended as a goodwill measure towards the new Trump administration, potentially aiming to delay their designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization,\u201d said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha, of the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.",
      "The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
      "The rebels had maintained that they only targeted ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities."

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",

      "Masahiro Nakai, one of Japan's top TV hosts and a former pop star, says he is retiring to take responsibility over sexual assault allegations",
      "TOKYO -- Masahiro Nakai, one of Japan\u2019s top TV hosts and a former pop star, said Thursday he was retiring to take responsibility over sexual assault allegations that are part of a wave roiling Japan's entertainment industry and have triggered an avalanche of lost advertising at one of the networks where he worked.",
      "Weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported in December that Nakai had reached a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize. He acknowledged \u201ca trouble\u201d and a settlement, while denying any violence, in a statement earlier this month. The magazine has also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "\u201cI, Masahiro Nakai, is retiring from entertainment activity as of today,\u201d Nakai said in a statement distributed to his paid fan club and posted on social media by apparent members. Japanese media also confirmed and reported his retirement.",
      "\u201cI am truly sorry for causing trouble and losses to so many people,\u201d Nakai said, and repeated his \u201csincere apology\u201d to the woman. \u201cI'm really, really sorry for saying good-bye this way ... Sayonara.\u201d",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged, SMAP.",
      "Last Friday, Fuji TV President Koichi Minato acknowledged the company had been aware of the problem six months before the magazine report and hadn't disclosed it. Minato apologized and said Fuji TV would investigate the case but also said he believed his employees had not done anything wrong.",
      "After dozens of commercials were withdrawn, Fuji TV apologized for causing trouble to advertisers and agencies but declined to disclose details.",
      "Following shareholders' demands for further clarification about the scandal and steps the company had taken and what measures are planned, Fuji was set to have a special board meeting later Thursday.",
      "Nakai said in his statement that he has sorted out all negotiations of terminating his shows and contracts with television, radio and sponsors. He said he has yet to taken all his responsibility and promised to \u201cface various problems and respond sincerely.\u201d",
      "Fuji Television Network\u2019s vice-chairperson Ryunosuke Endo, who is also head of Japanese commercial broadcasters\u2019 association, in a televised live news conference Thursday noted Nakai\u2019s retirement was his \u201cpersonal decision\u201d but said Nakai was part of the upcoming investigation and that he hoped for his sincere cooperation.",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince says the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump mused about returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince said Thursday the kingdom wants to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years, comments that came after President Donald Trump earlier put a price tag on returning to the kingdom as his first foreign trip.",
      "Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Trump.",
      "\u201cThe crown prince affirmed the kingdom\u2019s intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\u201d the report said.",
      "The readout did not elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which once was the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Trump\u2019s call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first reported abroad.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, like he did in 2017.",
      "\u201cThe first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\u201d Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 \u2014 we\u2019ll up it for all the inflation \u2014 I think I\u2019d probably go.\u201d",
      "The 2017 visit to the kingdom set in motion a yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, including the kingdom.",
      "Trump maintained close relations with Saudi Arabia, even after Prince Mohammed was implicated in the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",
      "The $600 billion pledge, which dwarves the gross domestic product of many nations, also comes as the kingdom faces budgetary pressures of its own. Global oil prices remain depressed years after the height of the coronavirus pandemic, affecting the kingdom's revenues.",
      "Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed also wants to continue his $500 billion project at NEOM, a new city in Saudi Arabia's western desert on the Red Sea. It also will need to build tens of billions of dollars' worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of it hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup."

      "BANGKOK -- The Chinese government is trying to encourage people to spend more by ensuring that share prices will rise, ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks to help jolt its languid markets out of the doldrums.",
      "Officials told reporters in Beijing on Thursday that beginning this year mutual funds should increase holdings of onshore stocks, called A-shares, by at least 10% a year over the next three years.",
      "Commercial insurance funds will have to put 30% of their annual new premium revenue into share markets beginning this year, they said.",
      "\u201cThis means that at least several hundred billion yuan of long-term funds will be added to A-shares every year,\u201d said Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.",
      "The announcement followed a meeting of top financial officials including ministries in charge of pensions and the central bank.",
      "\u201cImplementing the plan's various measures will further enhance the equity allocation capacity of medium- and long-term funds, steadily expand the scale of investment, improve the supply and structure of funds in the capital market, and consolidate good conditions for the capital market\u2019s recovery,\u201d Wu said.",
      "The ruling Communist Party announced this move just ahead of China\u2019s biggest holiday of the year, the Lunar New Year, which begins on Wednesday, Jan. 29. It\u2019s a time when families tend to splash out on food and travel and little red packets of money for children and young adults, a time of wishes for good fortune.",
      "Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai rose early Thursday after the announcement, with the Shanghai Composite index gaining 1.4%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong, a market linked to limited trading by mainland Chinese investors, shed early gains, edging 0.1% lower.",
      "China's share markets are huge but they hit their peak value before the 2008 global financial crisis and have meandered well below that level since. A lack of gains in share prices, along with falling housing prices, has discouraged Chinese families from spending, slowing consumer demand and economic growth.",
      "So far, the government's efforts to get people to spend more and save less have had mixed success. An initiative to promote purchases of energy efficient vehicles and appliances by paying subsidies to people who turn in their old versions of such items has boosted sales of such products. But share prices had traded stubbornly within a narrow range after a brief-lived rally late last year.",
      "Wu said pension funds will be required to revamp how they assess their performance and companies will be encouraged to conduct more share buybacks and pay higher dividends to give shareholders better returns.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important institutional breakthrough for the entry of medium- and long-term funds into the market. It can be said that it has solved a problem that has been unsolved for many years,\u201d he added.",
      "Sell-offs by major shareholders and high market volatility have handicapped the Chinese markets, Lei Meng, a China equity strategist at UBS Securities, said in a commentary Thursday.",
      "So, \u201cthe willingness of long-term investors to participate in the stock market has dwindled,\u201d Lei said. \u201cThe proposal of market value management reform directly addresses this issue because it is directly related to investors\u2019 sense of gain.\u201d",
      "But such moves have often failed in the past, since they attempt to override prevailing market sentiment by fiat.",
      "\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, such efforts can be likened to attempting to kindle a fire with damp wood \u2014 often proving ineffective and short-lived,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary."

      "NEW YORK -- Costco is pushing back on a shareholder proposal that urges the wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Investors were expected to vote on the recommendation during the company's annual meeting Thursday.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, submitted the proposal, arguing that Costco's DEI initiatives hold \u201clitigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\u201d",

The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\u201d",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \u201ccreativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\u201d and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco can be confident the proposal will be rejected.",

      "Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \u201cdisheartening.\u201d",

Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn\u2019t have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn\u2019t focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco.

      "Agrait said the decision was made following a \u201crecent review\u201d of the company's operations in the province.

      "Automaker Stellantis plans to reopen an assembly plant in Illinois and build the next generation Dodge Durango in Detroit, the automaker said Wednesday.",
      "In an email to employees North America Chief Operating Officer Antonio Filosa confirmed that the plant in Belvidere, about 70 miles northwest of Chicago, will produce a new midsize pickup truck. The move will put about 1,500 UAW-represented employees back to work.",
      "Stellantis will also move forward with plans to build the Durango mid-sized SUV at its Detroit Assembly Complex. In addition to Dodge and Chrysler vehicles Stellantis also owns brands including Ram and Jeep.",
      "Other plans include investing more in its Toledo, Ohio plant and making additional investments at its Kokomo, Indiana facilities to produce the GME-T4 EVO engine, keeping its manufacturing in the U.S.",
      "In a letter to union members, UAW President Shawn Fain and Kevin Gotinsky, director at the UAW Stellantis Department, said the Belvidere plant would reopen in 2027.",
      "In September the UAW filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board accusing Stellantis of illegally refusing to release information about plans to move Durango production from Detroit to Canada.",

    "story": [
      "Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into the next version of its Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into its next lineup of Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere.",
      "The three Galaxy S25 models unveiled Wednesday in San Jose, California, are the second generation to be designed for the AI age \u2014 a craze that market-leading Apple joined last September with the release of the iPhone 16. Most of the hardware on the Galaxy S25 is mostly the same as last year's model, except for a faster chip and a more powerful ultrawide lens on the camera.",
      "In its next phase, Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 as an \u201cAI companion\u201d capable of pulling more requests out of conversations, learning people\u2019s routines, anticipating people's needs and performing more technological tricks, such as being able to remove unwanted sounds from videos or identifying the name of a song upon request.",
      "The AI on the new Galaxy phones has been designed to toggle from one app to another to fetch, summarize and manage information, entertainment and other content stored on the devices. In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy."

      "Starbucks\u2019 decision to restrict its restrooms to paying customers has flushed out a wider problem: a patchwork of restroom use policies that varies by state and city",
      "Starbucks\u2019 decision to restrict its restrooms to paying customers has flushed out a wider problem: a patchwork of restroom policies that has left Americans confused and divided over who gets to use the loo and when.",
      "Rules about restroom access in restaurants vary by state, city and county. New York requires restroom access for customers at food establishments with 20 or more seats. California requires larger restaurants to provide restrooms for customers and guests, but only if they were built after 1984. In Chicago, restaurants don\u2019t need to have restrooms for customers unless they serve liquor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so mish-mash,\u201d said Steven Soifer, the co-founder and treasurer of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for clean, safe and well-designed public toilets. \u201cIf (a retailer) is serving food and drink, it\u2019s a health hazard if there isn\u2019t a public bathroom.\u201d",
      "Starbucks opened the can, so to speak, when it said last week it was reversing a 7-year-old policy that invited anyone to hang out in its stores or use the restroom, regardless of whether they bought anything. Starbucks\u2019 new code of conduct, which will be posted in all company-owned North American stores, also bans discrimination or harassment, consumption of outside alcohol, smoking, vaping, drug use and asking strangers for money.",
      "Reaction to the coffee chain's rule change for potty privileges was heated and divided. Many said Starbucks had the right to restrict restroom access to paying customers.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s up to Starbucks to set the atmosphere in their stores,\u201d Paul Skinner, 76, a retired firefighter in Daytona Beach, Florida, told The Associated Press. \u201cIf they\u2019ve decided that their paying customers are going to be better served by limiting restroom access, it doesn\u2019t make me mad. I\u2019m not going to stop going there.\u201d",
      "But Skinner said he also doesn\u2019t mind when homeless people occasionally visit his local Starbucks, and he sometimes offers to buy them breakfast.",
      "\u201cI think about all the people who don\u2019t have housing who would love to wander into a Starbucks and get warm,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there\u2019s one more place they aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d",
      "Other patrons lamented the change and said it didn\u2019t reflect Starbucks\u2019 often-stated goal of being a welcoming, community-oriented coffeehouse.",
      "Norman Bauman, 81, a semi-retired science writer in New York, said he stopped going to his local Starbucks to read, meet people and maybe buy a coffee when the store hung an \u201cEmployees Only\u201d sign on its sole restroom.",
      "\u201cI used to sit in a coffee shop once or twice a week and read my science journals. I always wondered how they could survive with customers like me,\u201d Bauman said.",
      "Social media posts ran the gamut. Some said the change was overdue, and that Starbucks' open-door policy had invited trouble and left fewer seats available for paying customers. But others criticized the company, saying the new policy made them much less likely to patronize Starbucks.",
      "Starbucks said its new code of conduct matched those of other big retailers. The Associated Press reached out to several other restaurant chains to ask about their restroom policies, including McDonald\u2019s and the parent companies of Dunkin\u2019, Burger King and KFC. None responded.",
      "But the National Retail Federation said businesses have a right to set limits on restroom use.",
      "\u201cStores and restaurants are private property, and these establishments have a right to enforce certain conduct in compliance with local, state and federal laws and regulations that ensures the health and safety of the customers they serve and the people they employ,\u201d the federation said in a statement.",
      "Starbucks stressed this week that the code of conduct is meant to end disruptive behavior.",
      "\u201cWe know there will be times when a customer needs to use the restroom before they\u2019ve made a purchase, or maybe uses the restroom and then decides against making a purchase, and of course that is OK,\u201d Starbucks spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said.",
      "Starbucks also said it will comply with any local laws requiring bathroom access for non-customers. But that\u2019s where things get murky.",
      "Most states and the District of Columbia follow the International Plumbing Code, which sets minimum regulations for plumbing systems. The code says businesses must make toilet facilities available to \u201ccustomers, patrons and visitors,\u201d said Soifer, who is an adjunct professor at the Adelphi University School of Social Work in addition to his duties at the American Restroom Association.",
      "But Andrew Rudansky, a spokesman for New York\u2019s Department of Buildings, said the International Code Council, which developed the plumbing code, has published separate commentary making clear that restrooms are intended for people \u201cinvolved with the activities of the establishment\u201d and not just passersby.",
      "Other states and cities use the Uniform Plumbing Code or the National Standard Plumbing Code as the basis for their regulations. Those codes also refer to restrooms as being for \u201ccustomers.\u201d",
      "But Soifer said even the term \u201ccustomer\u201d is ambiguous.",
      "\u201cIf I walk into a Starbucks and I\u2019m thinking of ordering something but I\u2019m not sure, am I a customer? Sure,\u201d he said. A homeless person may also be a customer, he pointed out, but might be discouraged from using the restroom.",
      "To add to the confusion, at least 20 states have passed versions of the Restroom Access Act, which requires retailers to let people with certain medical conditions, like Crohn\u2019s disease, use their restrooms, even if those restrooms are usually reserved for employees.",
      "The wider issue, Soifer said, is a lack of public restroom facilities in the U.S. If there were more public facilities, he said, there would be less pressure on retailers like Starbucks.",
      "\u201cThe number one complaint tourists have about visiting the U.S. is, \u2018Where are your public toilets?\u2019\u201d he said.",

      "Jimmy Donaldson \u2014 better known online as MrBeast \u2014 isn't in the TikTok bidding race just yet, according to a representative for the YouTube star.",
      "Donaldson stirred interest in a Jan. 13 post on X saying he\u2019d \u201cbuy TikTok so it doesn\u2019t get banned.\u201d The next day, Donaldson added, \u201cUnironically I\u2019ve had so many billionaires reach out to me since I tweeted this, let\u2019s see if we can pull this off.\u201d",
      "That seemed all the more certain this week when Donaldson was named in reports related to an investor group looking to buy the TikTok's U.S. operations in an all-cash offer, led by Recruiter.com Ventures founder and CEO Jesse Tinsley. A Monday post on X from Tinsley and a Tuesday announcement from Hastings LLP, a law firm that says it\u2019s advising the group, both identified MrBeast as being part of this effort.",
      "But, contrary to Tuesday night reports, MrBeast spokesperson Matthew Hiltzik said Donaldson hasn\u2019t officially joined any bids.",
      "\u201cSeveral buyers are holding ongoing discussions with Jimmy,\u201d Hiltzik told The Associated Press Wednesday. \u201cHe has no exclusive agreements with any of them.\u201d",
      "Beyond the question of whether Donaldson will be involved, how successful this group's offer will be has yet to be seen, and a dollar amount for its offer is still unknown. A representative for Tinsley declined to comment when asked for further details on Tuesday. The person also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about why Donaldson was named by Tinsley as a participant.",
      "TikTok's future in the U.S. continues to be uncertain. Under a federal law upheld by the Supreme Court last week, TikTok was supposed to find an approved buyer for its U.S. operations by Jan. 19 or face a nationwide ban. The platform shut off access for U.S. users late Saturday, hours before that deadline, but came back online Sunday with a message crediting then-incoming President Donald Trump, who had vowed to stall the ban.",
      "Trump has said he has a \u201cwarm spot\u201d in his heart for TikTok, which he credits with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election. During his first term, he attempted to ban the platform, calling it a national security threat because of its connections with China.",
      "Shortly after taking office on Monday, Trump directed the Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April. He also said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok, adding that \u201cevery rich person\u201d has called him about acquiring the social media platform.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump added he\u2019d be open to a purchase of TikTok by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and tech titan Elon Musk, who contributed roughly $200 million to a super political action committee that worked to organize Trump support last fall. However, Ellison and Musk have not indicated that they want to buy TikTok.",
      "Several other investors \u2014 such as billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have publicly expressed their interest in purchasing the popular app. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has also submitted a proposal to TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to create a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "A consortium launched by McCourt has offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for the platform, according to \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary, a Canadian investor who also joined that effort. On Tuesday, O\u2019Leary told CNBC that he\u2019s still interested in the platform, but believed that the law, which required ByteDance to divest by Sunday, would prevent it.",
      "\u201cWhat we need is to go back and ask Congress to open the order and provide for these new options, because they\u2019re not provided for right now,\u201d CNBC quoted him as saying.",
      "After the bipartisan TikTok law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews this week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. Representatives for ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to emails seeking comment.",

      "As the future of social media platforms such as TikTok remains unknown, a younger generation of farmers is relying on social media to connect with audiences outside agriculture",
      "BUCYRUS, Ohio -- Zoe Kent hopes people get a little joy out of her talking about farming on the Internet. In one of her latest videos, she compares pesticide application to dry shampoo. \u201cFarming is for the girls,\u201d she quips.",
      "On Instagram and TikTok, under the handle \u201cfarmwithzoe,\u201d Kent films herself putting on boots to load corn into a massive truck bed, posts memes about the price of grain and documents just about everything else about farm life from getting rocks stuck in her equipment to eating lunch on long days out in a combine.",
      "Now, the future of TikTok \u2014 and \u201cFarmtok,\u201d as some creators call the ecosystem of farm-related influencers online \u2014 has become more uncertain, thanks to a ban the U.S. government briefly implemented on TikTok over the weekend. That was followed by the new Trump administration rescinding that ban, at least for now, but farmers are all too aware that things could change, and with them, the ways that they share farm life with the rest of the world. But most say they\u2019ll keep adapting to whatever the platforms throw their way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s building your business on rented land, if you will,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s not guaranteed to be there.\u201d",
      "Even before the uncertain threat to TikTok\u2019s future, farm creators had to contend with social media\u2019s evolution. As algorithms changed, they faced greater challenges communicating with a public that many see as increasingly disconnected from agriculture.",
      "But most say they\u2019ll keep adapting to whatever the platforms throw their way. Some producers make extra money by building a following on TikTok or Instagram. Others use social media to advertise to local customers like restaurants or farmers\u2019 markets. Perhaps most importantly, they want to continue to build community with other farmers in the face of industry challenges like the toll of the profession on mental health, economic pressure and climate change.",
      "Multiple farmers said that disconnection has grown over the years as social media algorithms have changed. \u201cI know for a fact our social media reach is greatly diminished now,\u201d said Beth Satterwhite, who has been posting about her small organic vegetable farm in McMinnville, Oregon on Instagram for over a decade now. \u201cOn the ground stories of people working in agriculture are a little less interesting to the consumer \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually less interesting or just less visible,\u201d she said.",
      "Neil Denton, who farms corn, soybeans, wheat and rye in Barlow, Kentucky, shared a similar sentiment. He thinks that many of his over 80,000 followers on Instagram and 33,000 followers on TikTok are fellow producers, not members of the public. He calls that \u201cdisappointing\" and worries about how little people know about the food that ends up on their plates.",
      "But he does think there's a silver lining: \u201cFarming is a lonely occupation because you\u2019re not with a lot of coworkers,\u201d Denton said. \u201cI think some farmers use social media as an outlet...to be able to express yourself and to be able to feel like you\u2019re not lonely.\u201d",
      "Within the farming community, it can also be useful to learn from other farmers, many producers said. Megan Dwyer, who grows corn and soybeans and raises beef cattle in northwest Illinois, uses social media, especially X and Facebook, to gauge what matters to other farmers. \u201cIt's a great source for information, especially rapid information,\u201d she said.",
      "However, all that rapid information does have a price. Satterwhite described a \u201clanguage soup\u201d around agriculture, saying it could be hard for an outsider to tell what farming practices are legitimately better for the climate or environment. \u201cI see a lot of greenwashing,\u201d said Satterwhite, referring to the practice of falsely portraying a product or practice as eco-friendly to market it to an environmentally-conscious audience.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of misinformation out there,\u201d Kent said. \u201cI try to sift out who has genuine questions versus who just already has a stance and they\u2019re not willing to hear me out.\"",
      "That's something many farming influencers agree on \u2014 that they still want a place to have the conversation.",

      "There are six main categories: best car, SUV and truck, and electric versions in the same categories. This year, there are some new champions, while others are repeat winners. The starting prices listed below include destination charges.",
      "The 2025 Honda Civic isn\u2019t just this year\u2019s best car; it might be the best Honda Civic ever. A big reason why is the newly available hybrid powertrain. The EPA estimates that it helps the hybrid versions of the Civic get up to 49 mpg in combined city/highway driving, a stellar result that Edmunds confirmed in its real-world testing. Pleasingly, this doesn\u2019t come at the expense of power; indeed, the hybrid\u2019s acceleration is on par with that of the sporty Civic Si. All Civics also provide ample passenger space and many easy-to-use technology features.",
      "Starting price for a Civic sedan with the hybrid powertrain: $30,100",
      "Tesla made significant updates to its popular Model 3 last year, propelling this electric sedan to the Top Rated podium for 2025. It has affordable pricing, plenty of range, and a more premium and better-assembled cabin than before. It\u2019s well suited for daily commuting as well as longer trips. The Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive version went 338 miles on a single charge in the independent Edmunds EV Range Test. If it\u2019s excitement you\u2019re after, the Performance version easily satisfies with its capability to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in an Edmunds-tested 3.0 seconds.",
      "Starting price: $43,880",
      "Great fuel economy is key to why the 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid won the SUV category. The potential to get an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving is what you\u2019d typically expect from a compact sedan. For a three-row SUV, 36 mpg is outstanding. The Grand Highlander Hybrid also has a roomy interior, a smooth ride, and many standard technology and driver assist features. If you\u2019ve got a bigger family and want SUV-based utility to go along with hybrid gas savings, there\u2019s nothing better than the Grand Highlander.",
      "Starting price: $46,830",
      "The Kia EV9 is the Edmunds Top Rated Electric SUV two years in a row. It\u2019s an ideal vehicle for people wanting an EV with more space and utility than most other electric SUVs. It has three roomy rows of seating that you can use to schlep your kids to school or fold down to bring home your haul from Costco. It\u2019s also enjoyable to drive. The dual-motor versions of the EV9 have no problem getting up to highway speeds quickly or passing slow traffic. Other EV9 highlights include plenty of standard features, more than 300 miles of Edmunds-tested range, a long warranty and distinctive styling.",
      "Starting price: $56,395",
      "There are plenty of capable midsize trucks on the market for 2025. But none quite satisfy Edmunds\u2019 editors quite like the 2025 Ford Ranger. It starts off with its standard turbocharged 270-horsepower four-cylinder engine that gives the Ranger quick acceleration and the ability to tow up to 7,500 pounds when properly equipped. When you\u2019re not hauling stuff, the Ranger satisfies with a smooth ride and a quality interior with easy-to-use controls. There\u2019s even a Ranger Raptor version that\u2019s well suited for playing in the dirt.",
      "Starting price: $34,575",
      "The Rivian R1T electric pickup received a major update for 2025, one so extensive it lands at the top of our electric truck list. The exterior has the same styling as before, which stands out from the crowd for all the right reasons. It also retains the sharp handling and brisk acceleration it has always had. But now it has even more range \u2014 357 miles from the dual-motor and Max battery-equipped R1T Edmunds tested \u2014 and an easier-to-use touchscreen interface. Its clever all-wheel-drive system makes it surprisingly capable off-road.",
      "Starting price: $71,700",
      "If you\u2019re researching your next vehicle purchase, be sure to check out the Edmunds Top Rated award winners for 2025. Take a look at the full list of winners and runners-up, and test-drive them yourself to see if you agree with our picks.",

      "If the government fails to meet the target, it must pay a 10 million euro ($10.4 million) fine to Greenpeace.",

      "The agricultural industry became the focus of reduction demands. In 2022 thousands of farmers drove tractors through the streets of The Hague to protest proposals by the previous government to curb emissions. They argued that the agricultural sector was unfairly targeted while other industries contributing to emissions, such as aviation and construction, faced less far-reaching rules.",
      "The success of right-leaning parties in the 2023 elections, including one born out of the protests, was in part because of the backlash to plans to reduce emissions."

      "Alaska's political leaders are cheering an expansive executive order signed by President Donald Trump that aims to boost oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- President Donald Trump's expansive executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska is being cheered by state political leaders who see new fossil fuel development as critical to Alaska's economic future and criticized by environmental groups that see the proposals as worrying in the face of a warming climate.",
      "The order, signed on Trump's first day in office Monday, is consistent with a wish list submitted by Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy shortly after Trump's election. It seeks, among other things, to open to oil and gas drilling an area of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge considered sacred to the Indigenous Gwich'in, undo limits imposed by the Biden administration on drilling activity in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the North Slope and reverse restrictions on logging and road-building in a temperate rainforest that provides habitat for wolves, bears and salmon.",
      "In many ways, the order seeks to revert to policies that were in place during Trump's first term.",
      "But Trump \u201cjust can't wave a magic wand and make these things happen,\u201d said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity. Environmental laws and rules must be followed in attempts to unravel existing policies, and legal challenges to Trump's plans are virtually certain, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready and looking forward to the fight of our lives to keep Alaska great, wild and abundant,\u201d Freeman said.",
      "The order seeks to reverse a Biden administration decision canceling seven leases issued as part of the first-ever oil and gas lease sale in the refuge's coastal plain. Major oil companies didn't participate in the sale, held in early 2021 in the waning days of Trump's first term. The leases went to a state corporation. Two small companies that also won leases in that sale had earlier given them up.",
      "Trump's order calls for the Interior secretary to \u201cinitiate additional leasing\u201d and issue all permits and easements necessary for oil and gas exploration and development to occur. Gwich\u2019in leaders oppose drilling on the coastal plain, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and have expressed hope their voices will be heard in the Trump administration after being frustrated by former President Joe Biden.",
      "This comes weeks after a second lease sale, mandated by a 2017 federal law, yielded no bids. The law required that two lease sales be offered by the end of 2024. The state earlier this month sued the Interior Department and federal officials, alleging among other things that the terms of the recent sale were too restrictive.",
      "Alaska leaders cheered Trump's order, which was titled, \u201cUnleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is morning again in Alaska,\u201d Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan declared.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump delivered on his first day in office!\u201d Dunleavy said on social media. \u201cThis is why elections matter.\u201d",
      "Alaska has a history of fighting perceived overreach by the federal government that affects the state's ability to develop its natural resources. State leaders complained during the Biden administration that efforts to further develop oil, gas and minerals were being unfairly hampered, though they also scored a major win with the approval in 2023 of a large oil project known as Willow in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Environmentalists are fighting that approval in court.",
      "Dunleavy has repeatedly argued that development of Alaska's vast resources are critical for its future, and he's billed the underground storage of carbon and carbon offset programs as a way to diversify revenues while continuing to develop oil, gas and coal and pursue timber programs.",
      "The state faces economic challenges: oil production, long its lifeblood, is a fraction of what it once was, in part due to aging fields, and for more than a decade, more people have left Alaska than have moved here.",
      "Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, called Trump's order an \u201ceverything, everywhere, all-at-once order\u201d that seeks to undo measures that in some cases it took the Biden administration years to enact.",
      "\u201cThe length of time it would take the Interior Department to accomplish everything in that executive order is at least one term\u2019s worth, maybe two. And even then, you would need the science on your side when it all comes back. And we know in the case of Alaska specifically, the science is not on the side of unlimited drilling,\" he said, pointing to climate concerns and the warming Arctic.",
      "Communities have experienced the impacts of climate change, including thinning sea ice, coastal erosion and thawing permafrost that undermines infrastructure.",
      "Erik Grafe, an attorney with the group Earthjustice, called the Arctic \u201cthe worst place to be expanding oil and gas development. No place is good because we need to be contracting and moving to a green economy and addressing the climate crisis.\u201d"

      "The South Korean government has announced it will reduce indirect subsidies for biomass energy",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The South Korean government will reduce subsidies for biomass energy after rising domestic and international criticism of its link to deforestation. Environmental activists generally applauded the reforms but criticized loopholes and slow timelines for phasing out the subsidies.",
      "\u201cWhile not without caveats, (the) decision by the South Korean government demonstrates that large-scale biomass power has no place in a renewable energy future,\u201d Hansae Song, program lead at South Korea-based nongovernmental organization Solutions for Our Climate, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Biomass power, predominantly generated by burning wood, is growing globally as countries accelerate their transition to use cleaner energy \u2014 even though many scientists and environmentalists see it as problematic. In South Korea, it's the second-largest source of renewable energy.",
      "South Korea has subsidized biomass energy with millions of dollars for more than a decade via their renewable energy certificates program. In a single recent the government gave approximately $688 million to support power plants using biomass, according to a press release from South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.",
      "Faced with limited domestic forest resources, South Korea\u2019s biomass power industry has structured its business model around importing large volumes of wood pellets at lower prices from forest-rich nations. In 2023, imports accounted for 82% of the country\u2019s wood pellet demand, making South Korea the world\u2019s third-largest importer of biomass fuels, after the United Kingdom and Japan. An AP report found that biomass imported from Indonesia was linked to deforestation of natural, intact forest.",
      "\u201cAs the (biomass) market expanded, various issues emerged,\u201d the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in their press release. \u201cCriticisms regarding forest degradation and carbon emissions associated with biomass power generation persist.\"",
      "Under the revised policy, South Korea will not support any new biomass power plants. Subsidies for six existing state-owned plants co-firing coal and biomass will end this year, while the value of renewable energy certificates for three state-owned dedicated biomass plants will be phased down by 2027. At privately owned plants, subsidies for co-fired biomass from six plants will be phased out over the next decade, while subsidy weightings will be reduced for 12 dedicated biomass plants over the next 15 years.",
      "But environmental activists are critical of loopholes in the new policy.",
      "Domestically produced wood pellets and chips will still have the same level of support as before, including those co-fired with coal \u2014 which experts say could pose a threat to South Korea\u2019s forests. Power plants under construction or in planning with approved business permits are exempt from the new policy and subject to the phased reduction timelines for existing facilities.",
      "State-owned co-firing facilities \u2014 which will lose their renewable energy certificates \u2014 currently account for only 10% of South Korea\u2019s biomass power fleet, while the phase-out of most private co-firing will take over a decade to complete under the new policy, said Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "\u201cThis extends the life of thermal power plants \u2014 many with emissions per unit of energy higher than coal \u2014 beyond the Paris Agreement-aligned coal phase-out deadlines,\u201d Song wrote in an email to AP.",
      "The South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea Forest Service and Ministry of Environment did not respond to requests for comment from AP.",
      "Experts said South Korea's policy change could signal a shift in how countries consider and incorporate biomass as part of their own energy transitions.",
      "\u201cThere has been a positive shift in terms of discourse around biomass subsidies,\u201d said Claire Squire, a research associate at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy Center for Global Sustainability. \u201cCutting subsidies won\u2019t necessarily fix everything, but potentially if they\u2019re constructed differently than they have in the past, that might be an improvement.\u201d",
      "As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said.",
      "Experts including the IEA say it\u2019s important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather.",
      "Many scientists and environmentalists have rejected the use of biomass altogether. They say burning wood-based biomass can emit more carbon than coal and tree-cutting greatly reduces forests\u2019 ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Critics also say that using biomass to co-fire, instead of transitioning directly to clean energy, simply prolongs the use of coal.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is moving to end affirmative action in federal contracting and is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off.",
      "The moves Tuesday follow an executive order Trump signed on his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government\u2019s diversity and inclusion programs that could touch on everything from anti-bias training to funding for minority farmers and homeowners. Trump has called the programs \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and insisted on restoring strictly \u201cmerit-based\u201d hiring.",
      "The executive order on affirmative action revokes an order issued by President Lyndon Johnson, and curtails DEI programs by federal contractors and grant recipients. It\u2019s using one of the key tools utilized by the Biden administration to promote DEI programs across the private sector \u2014 pushing their use by federal contractors \u2014 to now eradicate them.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management in a Tuesday memo directed agencies to place DEI office staffers on paid leave by 5 p.m. Wednesday and take down all public DEI-focused webpages by the same deadline. Several federal departments had removed the webpages even before the memorandum. Agencies must also cancel any DEI-related training and end any related contracts, and federal workers are being asked to report to Trump's Office of Personnel Management if they suspect any DEI-related program has been renamed to obfuscate its purpose within 10 days or face \u201cadverse consequences.\u201d",
      "By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day. By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a \u201creduction-in-force action\u201d against those federal workers.",
      "The memo was first reported by CBS News.",
      "The move comes after Monday's executive order accused former President Joe Biden of forcing \u201cdiscrimination\u201d programs into \u201cvirtually all aspects of the federal government\u201d through \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d programs, known as DEI.",
      "That step is the first salvo in an aggressive campaign to upend DEI efforts nationwide, including leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to investigate private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against non-minority groups such as white men.",
      "The executive order picks up where Trump's first administration left off: One of Trump\u2019s final acts during his first term was an executive order banning federal agency contractors and recipients of federal funding from conducting anti-bias training that addressed concepts like systemic racism. Biden promptly rescinded that order on his first day in office and issued a pair of executive orders \u2014 now rescinded \u2014 outlining a plan to promote DEI throughout the federal government.",
      "While many changes may take months or even years to implement, Trump\u2019s new anti-DEI agenda is more aggressive than his first and comes amid far more amenable terrain in the corporate world. Prominent companies from Walmart to Facebook have already scaled back or ended some of their diversity practices in response to Trump's election and conservative-backed lawsuits against them.",
      "Here's a look at some of the policies and programs that Trump will aim to dismantle:",
      "Trump's order will immediately gut Biden's wide-ranging effort to embed diversity and inclusion practices in the federal workforce, the nation's largest at about 2.4 million people.",
      "Biden had mandated all agencies to develop a diversity plan, issue yearly progress reports, and contribute data for a government-wide dashboard to track demographic trends in hiring and promotions. The administration also set up a Chief Diversity Officers Council to oversee the implementation of the DEI plan. The government released its first DEI progress report in 2022 that included demographic data for the federal workforce, which is about 60% white and 55% male overall, and more than 75% white and more than 60% male at the senior executive level.",
      "Trump's executive order will toss out equity plans developed by federal agencies and terminate any roles or offices dedicated to promoting diversity. It will include eliminating initiatives such as DEI-related training or diversity goals in performance reviews.",
      "Trump's order paves the way for an aggressive but bureaucratically complicated overhaul of billions of dollars in federal spending that conservative activists claim unfairly carve out preference for racial minorities and women.",
      "The order does not specify which programs it will target but mandates a government-wide review to ensure that contracts and grants are compliant with the Trump administration\u2019s anti-DEI stance. It also proposes that the federal government settle ongoing lawsuits against federal programs that benefit historically underserved communities, including some that date back decades.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order is a \u201cseismic shift and a complete change in the focus and direction of the federal government,\u201d said Dan Lennington, deputy council for the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, which has pursued several lawsuits against federal programs. The institute recently released an influential report listing dozens of programs the Trump administration should consider dismantling, such as credits for minority farmers or emergency relief assistance for majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "He acknowledged that unwinding some entrenched programs may be difficult. For example, the Treasury Department implements housing and other assistance programs through block grants to states that have their own methods for implementing diversity criteria.",
      "It's not clear whether the Trump administration will target every initiative that stemmed from Biden's DEI executive order.",
      "For example, the Biden administration banned federal agencies from asking about an applicant's salary history when setting compensation, a practice many civil rights activists say perpetuates pay disparities for women and people of color.",
      "It took three years for the Biden administration to issue the final regulations, and Trump would have to embark on a similar rule-making process, including a notice and comment period, to rescind it, said Chiraag Bains, former deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Biden and now a nonresident senior fellow with Brookings Metro.",
      "Noreen Farrell, executive director of gender rights group Equal Rights Advocates, said that she was hopeful that the Trump administration \u201cwill not go out of its way to undo the rule,\u201d which she said has proved popular in some state and cities that have enacted similar policies.",
      "And Biden's DEI plan encompassed some initiatives with bipartisan support, said Bains. For example, he tasked the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council with expanding federal employment opportunities for those with criminal records. That initiative stems from the Fair Chance Act, which Trump signed into law in 2019 and bans federal agencies and contractors from asking about an applicant\u2019s criminal history before a conditional job offer is made.",
      "Bains said that's what Biden's DEI policies were about: ensuring that the federal government was structured to include historically marginalized communities, not institute \u201creverse discrimination against white men.\u201d",
      "Despite the sweeping language of Trump's order, Farrell said, \u201cthe reality of implementing such massive structural changes is far more complex.\u201d",
      "\"Federal agencies have deeply embedded policies and procedures that can\u2019t simply be switched off overnight,\u201d she added."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s goodwill in the cryptocurrency industry has taken a hit after he and his wife launched meme coins \u2014 a move critics say looks like an unseemly cash grab that undermines an effort to legitimize digital assets.",
      "The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president\u2019s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions.",
      "The price of bitcoin and other digital assets has soared since Trump won. A lavish \u201cCrypto Ball\u201d Friday ahead of Trump's inauguration sold tickets for thousands of dollars and featured a performance by the rapper Snoop Dogg.",
      "But as that party was ongoing, Trump announced on social media he was offering his very own cryptocurrency in the form of a meme coin. The move dampened the mood for many in the crypto community.",
      "\"I really was kind of bummed out when I saw it,\u201d said Tom Schmidt, a partner at a crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. \u201cIt just felt very grifty and cheap.\u201d",
      "Some crypto fans even joked on social media they missed Gary Gensler, the recently departed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who was viewed as the Biden administration\u2019s chief crypto antagonist thanks to the SEC's aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies.",
      "Meme coins are among the wilder and more unregulated corners of the crypto universe. They often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Popular meme coins include Dogecoin, whose mascot is a dog, and Fartcoin. Scammers have tried to pump up the price of certain meme coins before dumping them on unsavvy investors.",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin\u2019s release and eager buyers drove up the price of the coin to above $70 each. The price fell dramatically on Sunday after First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of her own meme coin, which also saw an initial price spike followed by a large fall. As of Tuesday afternoon, Trump\u2019s meme coin was trading at about $45 while the Melania meme coin was at about $4.",
      "Trump named SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as the agency's acting chief Tuesday and Uyeda quickly announced he was launching a new crypto task force to set the SEC on a \u201csensible regulatory path.\u201d Trump has promised to create a U.S. bitcoin stockpile and enact industry-friendly rules that make it easier for crypto companies to access the broader financial market.",
      "But by associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his ability to enact reforms.",
      "\u201cNow, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a casino for these meme coins,\u2019\u201d said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures. \u201cIt does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.\u201d",
      "The sale of Trump meme coins was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. In promoting the meme coin, Trump told supporters to \u201cHave Fun!\u201d The website selling the tokens says they are meant as expressions of support and not an investment opportunity. The coin\u2019s website said 200 million Trump meme coins are currently available, with plans to issue 1 billion over the next three years.",
      "The Trump family business recently released an ethics agreement  that prohibits Trump from \u201cday-to-day\u201d decision making at the Trump Organization when he\u2019s president and limits financial information about the business shared with him.",
      "The president and first lady were not the only ones promoting new cryptocurrencies around the inauguration. Lorenzo Sewell, the Michigan pastor who gave a spirited inaugural invocation Monday, announced the launch of a new coin named after him, which he said would be used to benefit his church.",
      "\u201cI need you to do me a favor right now, I need to you to go buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin,\u201d Sewell said in a video post on social media.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 21:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April",
      "President Donald Trump has directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April, but a host of questions remain - including whether Trump has the authority to issue such an order and if TikTok\u2019s China-based parent would be amenable to selling the popular social media platform.",
      "In an executive order signed on Monday, Trump instructed the U.S. attorney general to not enforce the ban for 75 days while his administration determines \u201cthe appropriate course forward in an orderly way that protects national security while avoiding an abrupt shutdown\u201d of TikTok.",
      "Under a federal law that was upheld by the Supreme Court last week, TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance was required to sell the platform to an approved buyer by Sunday or face a nationwide ban. On Saturday evening, a few hours before the ban took effect, TikTok became unusable for U.S. users. But it came back online on Sunday, with TikTok crediting Trump for helping the platform after he vowed on social media to stall the ban.",
      "The federal law, passed with bipartisan support in Congress last year, provides a 90-day extension if progress has been made toward a sale. But Trump\u2019s executive order now complicates matters for companies who could be liable for delivering TikTok\u2019s service to U.S. users.",
      "Some \u2014 at least as of now \u2014 appear to be taking a cautious approach. On Tuesday, Apple and Google, which operate the two most prominent app stores, did not offer TikTok or any other ByteDance-affiliated apps, such as Lemon8 or the video editing app CapCut, on their digital marketplaces.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know:",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government. But Trump does not have the power to overturn a law that Congress passed and subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The law does give the sitting president latitude on certain details, such as what would count as a \u201cqualified divesture\u201d of TikTok. But since an extension on a ban can only occur if \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made towards a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform, it\u2019s possible that Trump\u2019s order could face legal challenges.",
      "On Tuesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization that filed amicus briefs in support of TikTok\u2019s legal challenge against the statute, said it believed it would be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d to ignore the law.",
      "\u201cThere are no winners here, unless Congress repeals this law,\u201d David Greene, the organization\u2019s Civil Liberties Director, said in a statement.",
      "On Sunday, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas posted a message on X listing a number of state and federal agencies, and private entities, that might be willing to go to court to get the ban enforced. However, it\u2019s unclear if anyone is planning to challenge Trump's order.",
      "The order also warns possible challengers that because of \u201cthe national security interests at stake,\u201d attempts by parties to enforce the law \u201crepresents an encroachment on the powers\u201d of the executive branch.",
      "Even if an extension faces and fails to withstand legal scrutiny, it will buy time for ByteDance and TikTok to figure out their next move.",
      "Trump on Monday said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok, adding that \u201cevery rich person\u201d has called him about acquiring the social media platform.",
      "A day prior, he proposed terms in which the U.S. would have a 50% stake \u201cin a joint venture\u201d that would be \u201cset up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remain murky, and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.",
      "According to TikTok, roughly 60% of the privately-held ByteDance is owned by global investors, such as General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance employees and the company\u2019s founder, Zhang Yiming, also each have a 20% stake.",
      "The technology company has not disclosed financial details for its subsidiaries, including TikTok\u2019s global or U.S. operation.",
      "Even if an American company can acquire a 50% stake in TikTok, it\u2019s unclear how a Trump-orchestrated transaction would address some of the national security concerns that led lawmakers and the Biden administration to push for a divestment.",
      "For example, Trump has not addressed whether he will allow ByteDance to keep controlling the TikTok algorithm that fuels what users see on the platform. The algorithm, which is updated and maintained by ByteDance engineers in China, has been one of the main concerns among supporters of the law.",
      "Trump's executive order notes the administration must have a review period to assess government intelligence and the steps TikTok has taken to address Washington's concerns.",
      "Most likely, lots of negotiations about the future of TikTok.",
      "Last year, Beijing called the push in Washington to require a divestment of TikTok a \u201crobbers\u201d act. But on Monday, China signaled a possible softening of its stance.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said on Monday.",
      "Trump has threatened to slap tariffs as high as 100% on Chinese goods if Beijing refuses to allow a sale of TikTok. If China doesn't approve the deal, Trump said on Monday he would consider it somewhat of a \u201chostile act.\u201d",
      "After the law was passed last year, ByteDance said it did not have any plans to sell TikTok and then fought a legal battle against the statute for months. Representatives for the company and TikTok did not immediately respond Tuesday on whether they are willing to cut ties with each other within the new 75-day extension period.",
      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, a managing director of the Teneo consultancy, wrote that if amicable negotiations happen, Beijing might ultimately approve the export of TikTok\u2019s algorithm. However, a sale that excludes that technology might be more feasible legally and technically, Wildau wrote. Previously, Teneo had made a case that Beijing would not allow ByteDance to sell TikTok because of its concern for national dignity.",
      "\u201cThis is all a game of high-stakes poker,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \u201cTikTok is a chip on the table in broader U.S.-China negotiations.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he\u2019s installed the app on his phone. The U.S. government has banned it from federal devices due to concerns it could lead to spying by Chinese intelligence agencies.",
      "\u201cNo but I think I might put it there,\u201d said Trump, who credits the platform with helping him win more youth votes during last year's presidential election. During his first term, he tried to ban TikTok, calling it a national security threat.",

      "Goalkeeper Zack Steffen played his first international match in nearly three years, Brian White and Caden Clark scored their first national team goals and the United States beat Costa Rica 3-0 in the Americans\u2019 second straight friendly without Europe-b...",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Zack Steffen was back on the field for the United States to face Costa Rica, nearly three years after his previous appearance in goal, also against the Ticos.",
      "Stakes were far lower but the results were much better.",
      "Steffen made a pair of excellent saves, and the U.S. won 3-0 on Wednesday night as Brian White, Caden Clark and Patrick Agyemang scored in the Americans' second straight friendly without Europe-based players.",
      "\u201cIt's always nice to make some of those top-handed saves,\u201d Steffen said.",
      "White scored in the 21st minute and Clark in the 77th, the first international goal for both. White's goal was set up by Diego Luna, whose nose had been broken by an early elbow. After several minutes getting cotton stuffed in his nose, Luna returned to the field and assisted on the goal. Luna was replaced at the start of the second half.",
      "\u201cHe showed great character because he wanted to stay, he wanted to play,\u201d coach Mauricio Pochettino said. \u201cThis is a player that for sure we are going to have in consideration for the future.\u201d",
      "Agyemang added a goal in the 90th, scoring for the second straight game, and the U.S. extended its winning streak to four for the first time since winning nine straight in 2021.",
      "Steffen had not played for the U.S. since a 2-0 loss in the final World Cup qualifier at Costa Rica on March 30, 2022. He was left off the World Cup roster by coach Gregg Berhalter, who started Matt Turner at the tournament in Qatar, then was restored to the team last October after Pochettino took over.",
      "Steffen jumped to his left and used his right hand to tip away Alejandro Bran's shot from outside the penalty area in the 37th minute. He showed quick reflexes to parry's Allan Cruz's shot from about 10 yards out in the 56th.",
      "\u201cHe performed really, really well,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cToday was he great.\u201d",
      "Now 29, Steffen joined Major League Soccer's Colorado last year after playing in just two Premier League matches over 4 1/2 seasons with Manchester City.",
      "U.S. coaches have worked with Steffen to position himself deeper.",
      "\u201cIt just gave me time to shuffle my feet and get a good push,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if I'm higher the ball goes over my hand and then it goes in. Yeah, I like what they're teaching me.\u201d",
      "Turner has gotten on the field just twice this season for Crystal Palace, in the FA Cup and League Cup. Pochettino praised him for his national team play against Jamaica in November's CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinals but said there is competition for the starting spot.",
      "\u201cIt's a thing that we are going to evaluate every single camp in order to make the best decision,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe are very honest and transparent ... They know that through the performance they can be fighting for the position.\u201d",
      "Playing his third international match, White scored after he sprinted into the penalty area to take a through pass from Luna, took a touch and beat goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado to the far post. White, who turns 29 on Feb. 3, became the oldest American to score his first international goal since 29-year-old Matt Besler in 2016.",
      "Clark, a 21-year-old playing his second international match, got his goal when he one-timed a left foot shot at the top of the penalty area from a cross by Emeka Eneli, who stole the ball from Bran on a flank.",
      "Agyemang, a 24-year-old who debuted in Saturday's 3-1 win over Venezuela, scored against Anthony Walker on an angled shot from DeJuan Jones' pass.",
      "Europe-based players return for the Nations League semifinal against Panama on March 20. That match is during one of just six training camps remaining with the top pool before players arrive ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Playing its first match since hiring Miguel Herrera as coach, Costa Rica debuted four starters: defenders Santiago van der Putten and Ryan Bola\u00f1os, midfielder Creichel P\u00e9rez and forward Josimar M\u00e9ndez. In addition, Walker and defender Kevin Espinoza debuted at the start of the second half.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:02:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Jayden Daniels is getting praised around the league after leading the Washington Commanders to the NFC championship game against the odds and expectations",
    "story": [
      "Jayden Daniels is getting praised around the league after leading the Washington Commanders to the NFC championship game against the odds and expectations",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- Jayden Daniels has the Washington Commanders in the NFC championship game, and his list of admirers around the league continues to grow.",
      "Just this week, Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio called Daniels \u201ca young quarterback by birth certificate, not by the tape.\u201d C.J. Stroud of the Houston Texans believes Daniels has \u201chad the best rookie year of all time.\u201d",
      "If he and the Commanders beat the Eagles on Sunday, Daniels would become the first rookie quarterback to lead his team to the Super Bowl. And even as the hype train picks up speed, Daniels remains the same laser-focused competitor and down-to-earth person he was when he walked through the door as the second pick in the draft.",
      "\"He stays as even-keeled as any player I\u2019ve ever been around,\" top receiver Terry McLaurin said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve played in some of the most hostile environments, we\u2019ve been playing on some of the biggest stages and he\u2019s treating it the same each and every week. I love that about him.\u201d",
      "Daniels is making a strong case to back up Stroud's opinion. The 24-year-old out of LSU is the first player in franchise history to throw for 25 touchdown passes with fewer than 10 interceptions, and his 891 yards rushing are the most of any rookie QB in NFL history.",
      "After winning the Heisman Trophy in college and becoming the overwhelming favorite to win AP Offensive Rookie of the Year, Daniels said he was \u201cnot even thinking that far\u201d about making the Super Bowl and the trail he would be blazing by facing the Buffalo Bills or Kansas City Chiefs in New Orleans on Feb. 9.",
      "\u201cIt would obviously be a blessing, but I\u2019m just focused on how can I be better day by day,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThere\u2019s countless teams that want to be in this position. ... You can\u2019t really take it for granted, but you also just got to be in the moment.\u201d",
      "No problem there. Coach Dan Quinn likens Daniels on the sideline to \u201cThe Terminator\u201d because of his steely-eyed demeanor and avoidance of distractions.",
      "On the field, Daniels has led the Commanders to six consecutive victories \u2014 winning the first five on the final play of scrimmage and beating the 15-win Lions 45-31 in Detroit. He has thrown for 17 TDs during this stretch, and while Washington is an underdog at Philadelphia, Daniels' magic is the biggest reason to think the Commanders could pull off another upset.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got rare, in-the-moment skills that have allowed us to be into this spot,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s mental chaos going down and two minutes (left) and these tight moments where it can feel that tight, he\u2019s got the experience of somebody that\u2019s played a lot more football than a first-year player.\u201d",
      "Daniels isn't sure when teammates stopped treating him like a rookie. It was Week 8 after his Hail Mary pass to Noah Brown when veteran tight end Zach Ertz asked that everyone outside the organization stop acting like Daniels is a rookie because he had seen signs of it for months.",
      "\"He was very proactive in his approach to being great,\" said Ertz, who helped the Eagles win the Super Bowl seven years ago. \u201cA lot of times when you\u2019re young in the league, it\u2019s a lot of trial and error to see what works for you. And, oftentimes, you\u2019re reactionary in terms of how your process is. And it\u2019s like, \u2019Oh, after I failed a couple times, maybe I\u2019ll do X, Y and Z a little more.' Whereas Jayden, the moment he first got here, he was the first one in the building studying as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Daniels, who still warms up with a basketball and loves that sport, too, earned the reputation of being a gym rat during offseason practices. He showed up early to take part in walkthroughs before others and stayed late to make sure he got the playbook down pat.",
      "Quinn, himself one win from returning to the Super Bowl eight years since he and the Atlanta Falcons lost to New England, appreciates Daniels' competitiveness but respects even more how much stems from the rookie's preparation.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of being a leg up, and doing that type of extra work sometimes just also provides the right motivation for yourself: \u2018I\u2019ve seen that look. I\u2019m ready,\u2019\u201d Quinn said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done the work at it, so when the moment comes, you\u2019re ready to deliver.\u201d",
      "Daniels has delivered Washington's best season-to-season win improvement from 4-13 to 12-5, and he has been the centerpiece of an offense that has 10 games with zero turnovers \u2014 the most for the franchise since at least 1940, according to Sportradar.",
      "Each step along the way, Daniels has shown that no situation is too much pressure for him, something he credits to football being a fun escape for him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not really going out there and stressing about the moment because at the end of the day I get to do what I love each and every week win, lose or draw,\u201d Daniels said. \"It\u2019s just a blessing to be one of those kids that are able to fulfill their dream and live out their dream of playing on Sundays in the NFL.\u201d",

He served as Cleveland\u2019s assistant defensive backs coach from 2014 to 2015 before being hired for the same position in New Orleans. After five seasons with the Saints, he was hired by the Lions as defensive coordinator in 2021.",
      "Joe Namath, the quarterback who led the Jets to their only Super Bowl victory, in 1969, was pleased with the hiring of Glenn.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping all @nyjets fans are as thrilled as my family and I are that Aaron Glenn is our new Head Coach,\u201d Namath wrote on X shortly after the news broke. \u201cI wish the season would start next week!\u201d",

      "Caitlin Clark turned 23 on Wednesday",
      "PARIS -- Caitlin Clark turned 23 on Wednesday. And as a birthday gift of sorts, Tyrese Haliburton offered her some more high praise.",
      "Haliburton stars for the Indiana Pacers. Clark stars for the WNBA's Indiana Fever and is that league's reigning rookie of the year (plus is pals with fellow Kansas City Chiefs fan Taylor Swift).",
      "Haliburton and Clark have become fast friends, both complimenting the other on multiple occasions. Haliburton went as far as to say in Paris on Wednesday, on the eve of the first of two San Antonio-Indiana matchups here, that she's become a face of the game.",
      "Not the women's game. The whole game.",
      "\u201cI think when it comes to the game of basketball, she\u2019s probably in the top-five most famous people that are playing now, just in general. That includes our league as well,\" Haliburton said. \"And she handles it with such grace. She's such a cool person. At the end of the day, she\u2019s just a girl from Iowa who is just really good at basketball. And it's really cool to see what she does.\u201d",
      "It makes sense that Haliburton and Clark would hit it off. Both are kids from the Midwest, both are the faces of their franchises, both are point guards who can score and shoot from anywhere and, obviously, both now call Indianapolis home. They haven't collaborated on anything big yet, but Haliburton is hopeful that such a pairing happens.",
      "Haliburton says he considers the Fever \u2014 not just Clark, the whole organization \u2014 to be \u201crock stars\u201d at the forefront of growing the WNBA.",
      "\u201cAnything that I can do to help, I will. But I don\u2019t think she necessarily needs my help,\" Haliburton said. \"I mean, she\u2019s amazing. That group is amazing. To see what they\u2019re doing for women\u2019s basketball as a whole has been really cool. She\u2019s spearheaded that, so I\u2019m just glad to be a part of the journey and watch what she does.\u201d",
      "The NBA doesn't announce things too far ahead, but it's safe to guess that more games in Paris are coming in future years.",
      "And if the San Antonio Spurs get asked, they'll jump at the chance.",
      "With French star Victor Wembanyama already cemented as the face of the franchise, the Spurs \u2014 who already had an enormous following in France because of former players like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw \u2014 are seeing even more interest here.",
      "Being here this week for a pair of games with Indiana is only strengthening the Spurs' ties with France.",
      "\u201cAny time we have an opportunity to play internationally, we want to be in that rotation,\u201d Spurs CEO R.C. Buford said Wednesday.",
      "The Spurs even arranged for a pop-up shop to happen during this visit, featuring exclusive merchandise, items showcasing Wembanyama and Chris Paul, plus jerseys for team greats like Parker, Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an expensive trip,\" Buford said. \u201cThe economics say a single trip probably isn't a big moneymaker. However, our goal is to show the community of France that we\u2019re here for the long run.\u201d",
      "There will be a lot of French people at these games Thursday and Saturday, as would be expected in Paris.",
      "But these games will also be global \u2014 truly global.",
      "The NBA said fans from at least 53 different countries and territories have purchased tickets for the Spurs-Pacers games, a record for any league event anywhere in the world.",
      "These will be the NBA\u2019s 96th and 97th games in Europe and the 14th and 15th games in France, all happening in a season that marks the 40th anniversary of the league's inaugural games in Europe \u2014 back when the Seattle Supersonics played exhibition games in Germany, Switzerland and Italy against local professional teams.",
      "San Antonio is playing in France for the first time since the preseason in 2006. Indiana is playing in France for the first time.",

      "The AP released an all-bowl team Jan. 7 for players who competed in non-playoff bowl games. Now the cooperative is unveiling an all-playoff team reserved only for players from the 12 College Football Playoff teams.",
      "Since only four teams actually won any playoff games this season, all but one of the players on the all-playoff team come from those four schools.",
      "Because some defenses operate in 4-3 schemes, others use a 3-4 and still others go with a base nickel defense, the AP covered all bases by having a defense with four linemen, four linebackers and five defensive backs.",
      "Howard completed more than 75% of his passes for 1,150 yards with eight touchdowns and two interceptions in four playoff games. He was named the offensive most valuable player of the championship game after going 17 of 21 for 231 yards with two touchdowns and rushing for 57 yards on 16 carries in a 34-23 victory over Notre Dame.",
      "Henderson had two touchdowns in each of Ohio State\u2019s first two playoff victories and then caught a pass well behind the line of scrimmage and turned it into a 75-yard score in the Buckeyes\u2019 28-14 Cotton Bowl triumph over Texas. He finished the playoff with 36 carries for 265 yards and four touchdowns plus eight catches for 149 yards and one touchdown.",
      "Before the championship game, the all-playoff team figured to include one of Penn State\u2019s two outstanding running backs \u2014 Nicholas Singleton or Kaytron Allen \u2014 to pair with Henderson. But Judkins forced his way onto the team with his outstanding performance against Notre Dame. He ran for 100 yards and two touchdowns on 11 carries while also catching two passes for 21 yards and a touchdown. Judkins finished the playoffs with 255 yards rushing and seven total touchdowns (6 rushing, 1 receiving).",
      "Texas was on the brink of playoff elimination before Golden made a 28-yard touchdown catch on a fourth-and-13 overtime play in a 39-31 Peach Bowl quarterfinal victory over Arizona State. He totaled 11 receptions for 249 yards to go along with that touchdown in three playoff games. That included seven receptions for 149 yards against Arizona State.",

      "This Associated Press All-America second-team selection capped his sensational freshman season by catching 19 passes for 381 yards and five touchdowns in four playoff games. He scored twice in a 42-17 first-round victory over Tennessee and followed that up by having seven receptions for 187 yards and two more scores in a 41-21 Rose Bowl rout of previously unbeaten Oregon. Smith caught five passes for 88 yards and a touchdown against Notre Dame, and his 56-yard catch on a third-and-11 play set up a clinching field goal.",
      "The winner of the John Mackey Award as college football\u2019s top tight end scored two touchdowns in Penn State\u2019s 31-14 Fiesta Bowl victory over Boise State. Although Penn State got no catches from its wideouts in the Orange Bowl, Warren juiced the Nittany Lions\u2019 offense by catching six passes for 74 yards and running for 21 yards on two carries. He totaled 16 receptions for 171 yards and three carries for 27 yards in three playoff games.",
      "Skattebo, an AP All-America first-team running back, sparked Arizona State\u2019s Peach Bowl comeback by rushing for 143 yards and two touchdowns on 30 carries, catching eight passes for 99 yards and even throwing a 42-yard touchdown pass.",
      "Banks, an AP All-America first-team tackle, allowed one quarterback hurry and no sacks in Texas\u2019 three playoff games, according to Pro Football Focus. He had an overall PFF blocking rating of over 75 in a 38-24 first-round victory over Clemson and against Ohio State. He had an 86.4 pass-blocking rating in the semifinal loss to the Buckeyes.",
      "After playing center in 2023, Hinzman moved to left guard this season to make room for Alabama transfer Seth McLaughlin. But after McLaughlin injured his Achilles tendon in November, Hinzman moved back to center and helped open up plenty of holes for Henderson and Judkins throughout the playoffs.",
      "Jackson made the AP All-America team as a second-team guard, but he moved to left tackle when Josh Simmons suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. He didn\u2019t allow a single sack in any of Ohio State\u2019s four playoff games, according to PFF.",
      "Penn State\u2019s left tackle allowed no sacks and just one quarterback hurry in three playoff games, according to Pro Football Focus. PFF graded Rucci out at over 70 overall in each of Penn State's playoff games.",

      "Carter, an AP All-America first-team selection and the AP Big Ten defensive player of the year, injured his shoulder against Boise State but returned for the semifinal and collected five tackles and a sack against Notre Dame while playing hurt. He also had three tackles and a sack against SMU.",

      "Watts, an AP All-America first-team safety, made an interception in the red zone that prevented Indiana from taking an early lead in Notre Dame\u2019s first-round playoff game. PFF rated him at 70 or higher in three of Notre Dame\u2019s four playoff contests.",

      "Jeter had a 27-yard field-goal attempt bounce off the left upright in the fourth quarter of the championship game, but he also helped Notre Dame get to that point by making a tiebreaking 41-yarder with seven seconds left in the Orange Bowl. Jeter went 7 of 9 on field-goal attempts in the playoffs, including 6 of 6 from 40-49 yards out.",
      "Rendell\u2019s 41.5 playoff punting average might not seem particularly impressive on the surface, but he landed seven of his 13 punts inside the opponent\u2019s 20-yard line and didn\u2019t have a single touchback.",
      "Harrison\u2019s 98-yard touchdown return of the second-half kickoff in the Sugar Bowl was the best return for anyone in this playoff.",

      "A 23-year-old right-hander whose fastball tops 100 mph, Sasaki announced his intention to sign with the Dodgers on Friday and was to be introduced at a news conference Wednesday at Dodger Stadium. He joined fellow Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto on the Dodgers in a decision many baseball executives long expected.",
      "Sasaki had until Thursday to finalize a contract. He was considered an international amateur under Major League Baseball's rules because he is under 25 and does not have six years service in the Japanese major leagues, making him subject to international signing bonus pools.",
      "The Dodgers started with a pool of $5,146,200 but increased it to $8,102,800 with a pair of trades last week, acquiring $1.5 million from Cincinnati and $1,456,600 from Philadelphia.",
      "The Dodgers are planning to use a six-man rotation, which could ease Sasaki\u2019s transition to Major League Baseball, as the Dodgers attempt to become the first repeat champion since the New York Yankees from 1998 to 2000.",

      "During a news conference at the winter meetings last month, Sasaki\u2019s agent, Joel Wolfe, denied an agreement with the Dodgers was already in place. Wolfe said MLB had investigated.",
      "Sasaki was 10-5 with a 2.35 ERA in 18 games last year, striking out 129 hitters in 111 innings during a season limited by shoulder inflammation. He went 7-4 with a 1.78 ERA in 15 starts in 2023, when he had an oblique injury. He has a 29-15 career record with a 2.10 ERA over four seasons with the Marines and pitched a perfect game against Orix in April 2022.",
      "Among international amateur free agents, Los Angeles also agreed to deals with Venezuelan infielders Luis Tovar ($397,500) and Moises Acacio ($197,500), Panamanian left-hander Adrian Torres ($362,500) and Colombian shortstop Luis Luna ($137,500).",

      "Here are some of the things on Victor Wembanyama's Paris itinerary to this point: arranging a shopping trip and then a dinner for San Antonio Spurs teammates on Monday, dedicating a pair of outdoor courts in his hometown and then some Fashion Week appearances on Tuesday and heading to the Paris Saint-Germain vs. Manchester City Champions League match on Wednesday.",
      "On occasion, basketball was also played.",
      "He's the star, he's the host, the hometown kid, the conquering hero, the center of attention this week. Wembanyama is handling all those roles \u2014 and probably more \u2014 in stride, in ways that make you forget he only just turned 21 this month.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s very grounded in everything that comes with it,\" acting Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \"And he wants it, because he knows what his goals are and the way he goes about it, again, is a testament to himself and his family the most, because he is a mature, humble young man.\u201d",
      "The main events start Thursday when Wembanyama and the Spurs take on the Indiana Pacers in the first of two games in Paris. The rematch is Saturday, both happening at Accor Arena, the same building where Wembanyama played in the knockout round of the Paris Olympics last summer when he and France wound up losing to the U.S. in the gold-medal game.",
      "\u201cIt's nice to come here. ... It's a (place) that is dear to me,\u201d Wembanyama said.",
      "It's not like being a star player doesn't do enough to impress his teammates. But just in case, Wembanyama decided to roll out his own personal red carpet for the Spurs upon their arrival in France on Monday. He planned a store visit and then dinner and has basically served as a tour guide throughout the trip.",
      "Had San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich been able to travel with the Spurs to Paris, Wembanyama might have deferred on arranging the dinner. But with Popovich not healthy enough to accompany the team, Wembanyama stepped up.",
      "\u201cPop had a schedule here, you know. I know he would have done something like that, too,\u201d Wembanyama said. \u201cDoing that on the first day was important for me. It was a welcome to my team to show them because I know if I went to any of these guys\u2019 country or city, I would have got to find out about where they come from to learn to know them better because they\u2019re all good human beings. It\u2019s a real chance to share these moments together.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Wembanyama won't be out and about. There won't be socializing. He'll be locked in on the game, as he always is on game days. There's a trip to the Eiffel Tower \u2014 Wembanyama has been there before \u2014 with the rest of the Spurs on Friday, then another Spurs-Pacers game on Saturday and a flight back to the U.S. on Sunday.",
      "\u201cGetting the chance to see him day in and day out, getting a chance to see his work ethic and getting a chance to see and know who he is, it's just different,\" Spurs guard Chris Paul said. \u201cIt's different to see his humility, to see his work ethic, to see how happy he is to be here, to be able to play in front of his family and friends, people who raised him.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama, who likely will be picked for his first All-Star Game in the coming days \u2014 starters will be revealed Thursday, reserves the following Thursday, Jan. 30 \u2014 is having a massive season. He is averaging 24.4 points, 10.8 rebounds and a league-best 4.0 blocks per game. Nobody in the NBA has finished a season with those numbers since Hakeem Olajuwon in 1992-93.",

    "title": "Bucs OC Liam Coen withdraws from consideration for Jaguars' coaching job, AP source says",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 11:53:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Liam Coen is no longer a candidate to be Jacksonville&rsquo;s next head coach",
    "story": [
      "Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Liam Coen is no longer a candidate to be Jacksonville\u2019s next head coach",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Liam Coen is no longer a candidate to be Jacksonville's next head coach.",
      "Coen, who was scheduled for an in-person interview on Wednesday with Jaguars owner Shad Khan, general manager Trent Baalke and others, pulled his name out of consideration and will sign a new contract with the Buccaneers, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press.",
      "The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because neither side has disclosed the decision publicly.",
      "The move upends Jacksonville's search, which had been narrowed to Coen, Las Vegas defensive coordinator Patrick Graham and former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh. Graham and Saleh are scheduled for in-person interviews on Thursday and Friday.",
      "Khan insisted after firing Doug Pederson earlier this month that he didn't believe Baalke's retention as GM would affect the coaching search.",
      "The 60-year-old Baalke has a less than spotless reputation around the league, and three of the five coaches he's hired in San Francisco and Jacksonville have had one-and-done tenures. His draft picks have been spotty, at best, and last year's free-agent class turned out to be one of the worst in franchise history.",
      "Keeping Baalke in place clearly has provided pause, at the very least, for candidates. Detroit offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and Detroit defense coordinator Aaron Glenn were among the 10 who interviewed with Jacksonville initially, only to see Johnson sign with Chicago and Glenn scheduling second interviews with New Orleans and the New York Jets.",
      "Jacksonville still could double back on Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Brady, Philadelphia offensive coordinator Kellen Moore and Kansas City defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. Under NFL rules, the earliest they can interview again is next week because their teams are in conference title games.",
      "But Coen is out, turning down the chance to become a head coach now to remain a coordinator. The 39-year-old was the architect of one of Tampa Bay's most productive offenses in team history. The Buccaneers ranked third in the NFL in yards (399.6 per game) and fourth in points (29.5).",
      "Coen had less success during his first NFL season, in 2022 with the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams ranked last in the league in yards while playing half the season without quarterback Matthew Stafford and receiver Cooper Kupp. Coen returned to the college ranks (Kentucky) following that year.",
      "Staying in Tampa Bay could leave Coen in line to eventually replace coach 61-year-old head coach Todd Bowles.",
      "The Jaguars (4-13), meanwhile, will move forward with one less candidate.",
      "They have a young quarterback (Trevor Lawrence) with upside, a budding star at receiver (Brian Thomas Jr.), a few defensive building blocks (cornerback Tyson Campbell and pass rushers Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker), a relatively new practice facility, a $1.4 billion stadium renovation upcoming and a hands-off owner with deep pockets.",
      "They have the fifth overall draft pick in April and roughly $50 million in salary cap space for 2025, play in arguably the NFL\u2019s weakest division (AFC South) and work in a state with plenty of sunshine and no income tax. They also went 3-10 in one-score games \u2014 an indication they could be a quick fix.",
      "But Khan is committed to playing at least one home game annually in London \u2014 even though it may put the team at a competitive disadvantage \u2014 and will play home games in 2026 in front of a reduced capacity and play all of 2027 away from Jacksonville. The Jags also have several aging veterans and Baalke.",

    "story": [
      "Indiana\u2019s Rick Carlisle has coached more games against San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich than anyone else",
      "PARIS -- Indiana's Rick Carlisle has coached more games against San Antonio's Gregg Popovich than anyone else. They've had 87 head-to-head matchups, including playoffs.",
      "Thursday was supposed to be No. 88.",
      "It won't happen, and nobody knows when \u2014 or if \u2014 Popovich will be back on the Spurs' sideline. Popovich's absence is a glaring one in Paris this week for the pair of NBA matchups between the Pacers and Spurs on Thursday and Saturday; he's back home, recovering from a November stroke.",
      "The Spurs say he's making progress. Some coaches from around the league have heard the same. That's about the extent of the updates; nobody says much more than that out of respect for Popovich and his privacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really an institution and he\u2019s been such a constant,\" Carlisle said. \"It\u2019s different not seeing him. But I\u2019ve had some communication with him. He\u2019s doing better all the time. And the hope is he'll be back.\u201d",
      "It's certain that not being in Paris \u2014 one of his favorite cities \u2014 is particularly painful for Popovich this week. This trip has many of the things that he loves most: people from different cultures, incredible food, some basketball and, of course, wine. Lots of wine. He's basically the NBA's sommelier, and the dinners he would have thrown in Paris surely would have been legendary.",
      "Popovich, who turns 76 next week, is the NBA\u2019s all-time wins leader who has guided the Spurs to five championships, plus he coached USA Basketball to a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He had the stroke at the team's arena in San Antonio on Nov. 2, getting tended to by emergency personnel who were at the arena for the Spurs' game that night.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s changed my life in terms of just being able to learn under him, watch him from afar and closely, and get to the point where we could challenge each other in ways,\" acting Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to be able to grow in my voice and be empowered by him in many ways. And we are in contact constantly. He is watching games, still as opinionated as he\u2019s ever been, and competitive, and what you would think \u2014 giving praise and cussing me out, all at the same time.\u201d",
      "Johnson took over on almost no notice for that game on Nov. 2 against Minnesota. The Spurs won that game and are 17-19 since Popovich had the stroke, winning six out of eight games in one stretch and four out of five in another. They're in a bit of a slide right now, losing six of their last seven contests. (It should be noted that those wins and losses since Nov. 2, by NBA rule, still go on Popovich's career record because he's still listed as the head coach.)",
      "\u201cPop\u2019s health has been the priority since the start of this and until dot-dot-dot,\" Johnson said. \"That's kind of how we, and I, take the approach. We want the best for Pop and I want the best for this team and however I can help is where I'll put my energy.\u201d",
      "San Antonio guard Chris Paul joined the Spurs last summer in large part because of his respect for Popovich. He has a photo of himself on the phone in Las Vegas, talking to Popovich when the deal got done.",
      "Turns out, there's far more opportunities for phone time with Pop than Paul ever envisioned.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not even sure if this is public, but he calls,\" Paul said. \u201cHe calls after games and I talk to him, and he tells me what he sees, and I appreciate that more than anything because he doesn\u2019t have to do that. And he does.\u201d",
      "The thing is, Popovich likely feels like he does have to do that. It's still his team. He's still the coach. Johnson is still one of his assistants. He's still the president. He's just not on the sideline. Or in practice. Or, this week, in Paris.",
      "Will he coach this season? Next season? Ever again? Will he come back in a different capacity? All are valid questions, and the Spurs \u2014 a tight-lipped organization by nature \u2014 either don't know the answers or can't offer them yet.",
      "It's also unknown what aftereffects of the stroke, if any, Popovich is dealing with. Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year.",
      "\u201cAll I can share is he's attacking his rehab in a way that ... you know Pop, you\u2019ve observed him for years,\" Spurs CEO R.C. Buford, one of the people closest to Popovich, said Wednesday. \u201cThe same resilience that he\u2019s shown over the course of our career as a coach, he\u2019s approaching his return in his rehab in an incredibly unique way. The relationships that he had with our former players and the care that they\u2019re sharing with him is amazing. And his improvement continues.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I started the car up and drove through that garage door, I had the biggest smile on my face,\u201d Hamilton said of his first drive in a Ferrari since joining the Italian team for the 2025 season. \u201cIt reminded me of the very first time I tested a Formula 1 car, it was such an exciting and special moment, and here I am, almost 20 years later, feeling those emotions all over again.\u201d",
      "Part-way through the day, Hamilton headed over to fans who had waited for hours in the wet conditions since early morning for a glimpse of him behind the wheel. Wearing a jacket in Ferrari red, he waved, gave a thumbs-up gesture and put a hand to his heart. Hamilton's mother was among his family members on hand for the occasion.",
      "\u201cI've been lucky enough to have many firsts in my career, from the first test to the first race, podium, win and championship, so I wasn\u2019t sure how many more firsts I had but driving a Scuderia Ferrari HP car for the first time this morning, was one of the best feelings of my life,\u201d Hamilton said.",

Besides having that winning gene, it's about how tough, we've got tough dudes. It's how competitive, we've got competitive dudes. It's basketball IQ, we have high basketball IQ guys.\u201d",
      "Louisville (15-5, 8-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) already has exceeded its combined overall and conference win totals from the past two seasons under Kenny Payne. He finished 12-52 in his first collegiate coaching job long after being a standout player for Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum and a member of the Cardinals' 1986 national championship team.",
      "In its first game as a Top 25 team since January 2021, Louisville won 98-73 at ACC newcomer SMU on Tuesday night. Reyne Smith, the Australian senior guard who came with Kelsey from the College of Charleston, set a single-game program record with 10 3-pointers while scoring 30 points, and Chucky Hepburn set the school record with 16 assists.",

You know, the old quote, it\u2019s amazing how much can be accomplished when nobody cares who gets the credit. I think that defines this team in a lot of ways.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got to make some serious headway quickly,\" Thibodaux said.",
      "Of the four first-time candidates this year, two of them \u2014 Suzuki and Sabathia \u2014 were voted into the Hall. Two others cleared the 5% threshold needed to stay on the ballot.",
      "Dustin Pedroia debuted at 11.9%, and F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez drew 20.6% approval.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez will be a candidate to watch going forward. His 3.42 career ERA was better than Sabathia's 3.74, but he lacked longevity. Still, he's in a position to improve and has plenty of time.",
      "\u201cHe's starting out in a better spot than Mike Mussina did. Any number of other candidates (who got elected) started way lower than 20%,\" Thibodaux said. \"It looks like one of those candidacies that'll probably be five, six, seven, 10 years, and we'll just have to see where it ends up.\u201d",
      "It's not just next year that presents a big chance for holdover candidates to gain support. The 2027 newcomers are fairly pedestrian aside from Buster Posey.",
      "After that, there could be multiple first-ballot inductees in 2028 (Albert Pujols and maybe Yadier Molina) and 2029 (Miguel Cabrera and perhaps Zack Greinke and Joey Votto).",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",
      "\u201cLook, all I know is, I\u2019m good for my $80 billion,\u201d said Nadella, laughing."

      "Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into the next version of its Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into its next lineup of Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere.",
      "The three Galaxy S25 models unveiled Wednesday in San Jose, California, are the second generation to be designed for the AI age \u2014 a craze that market-leading Apple joined last September with the release of the iPhone 16. Most of the hardware on the Galaxy S25 is mostly the same as last year's model, except for a faster chip and a more powerful ultrawide lens on the camera.",
      "In its next phase, Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 as an \u201cAI companion\u201d capable of pulling more requests out of conversations, learning people\u2019s routines, anticipating people's needs and performing more technological tricks, such as being able to remove unwanted sounds from videos or identifying the name of a song upon request.",
      "The AI on the new Galaxy phones has been designed to toggle from one app to another to fetch, summarize and manage information, entertainment and other content stored on the devices. In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have detected cosmic waves that sound like birds chirping in an unexpected place.",
      "These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency as human hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimic high-pitched bird calls.",
      "Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they've never been measured before.",
      "\u201cThat opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,\u201d said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work.",

      "The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft \u2014 NASA's Van Allen Probes \u2014 heard the chirps from Earth's radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection.",
      "The latest notes were picked up by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun's magnetic fields. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",

      "Trump removed the Spanish version of the page in 2017. At that time, White House officials said they would reinstate it. President Joe Biden reinstated the page in 2021.",
      "The page's removal coincided with Trump\u2019s first-day wave of executive orders highlighted by the launch of an illegal immigration crackdown that was one of his key campaign pledges.

      "President Donald Trump is talking up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.",
      "\u201cIt's big money and high quality people,\u201d said Trump, adding that it's \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration.",
      "Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024.",
      "\u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI.",
      "Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of golden age,\u201d said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a \u201cgolden age\u201d with him back in the White House.",
      "Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork.",
      "While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented.",
      "The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers.",
      "OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI.",
      "The push to build data centers predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally.",
      "Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks.",
      "The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses.",
      "Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being.",
      "CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment.",
      "Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending.",
      "Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday to keep TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform\u2019s users even as national security questions persist.",
      "TikTok\u2019s China-based parent ByteDance was supposed to find a U.S. buyer or be banned on Jan. 19. Trump\u2019s order could give ByteDance more time to find a buyer.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has amassed nearly 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. Yet its 170 million U.S. users could not access TikTok for more than 12 hours between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised to pause the ban on Monday, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.",
      "Business leaders, lawmakers, legal scholars, and influencers who make money on TikTok are watching to see how Trump tries to resolve a thicket of regulatory, legal, financial and geopolitical issues with his signature.",
      "TikTok's app allows users to create and watch short-form videos, and broke new ground by operating with an algorithm that fed viewers recommendations based on their viewing habits. But concerns about its potential to serve as a tool for Beijing to manipulate and spy on Americans pre-date Trump's first presidency.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance and the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Courts ended up blocking the orders, but less than a year ago Congress overwhelmingly passed a law citing national security concerns to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold it to an approved buyer.",
      "The law, which went into force Sunday, allows for fines of up to $5,000 per U.S. TikTok user against major mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services like Oracle if they continued to distribute TikTok to U.S. users beyond the deadline for ByteDance's divestment.",
      "Trump on Sunday said he had asked TikTok's U.S. service providers to continue supporting the platform and app while he prepared to sign an executive order to stop the ban for now.",
      "\u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, his social networking site.",
      "The law that Congress passed and now-former President Joe Biden signed in April allowed for a 90-day extension if there had been progress toward a sale before the statute's effective date. Less certain is whether that provision can be applied retroactively, according to Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cExecutive orders cannot override existing laws,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the new president has that authority to issue the 90-day extension of a law that\u2019s already gone into effect.\u201d",
      "Kreps also doubts the conditions for a delay exist at this point without so much as even a potential buyer being named to prove that a sale was moving along.",
      "But Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, has written that the law also empowers the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture\u201d \u2014 suggesting Trump could have discretion to say whether or when ByteDance meets the terms of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.",
      "Although ByteDance spent months repeating it wasn't interested in selling, Beijing on Monday also signaled a possible easing on China's stance on TikTok to allow it to be divested from its Chinese parent company. China\u2019s vice president held meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Tesla tech titan Elon Musk on Sunday.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, said Monday that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Until now, it was widely believed that Beijing would not allow the sale of TikTok, which had come to embody China\u2019s defiance in the face of \u201cU.S. robbery.\u201d However, TikTok was among several issues brought up in a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump on Friday, though details were not available.",
      "Trump later announced plans to delay the TikTok ban and suggested a joint venture in which the U.S. would get a 50% ownership of the app. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s CEO, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government, so it\u2019s possible that Trump will direct the DOJ to ignore the law. Such a move might itself be subject to legal scrutiny but would buy time for TikTok.",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to save TikTok may put him at odds with some of the House members and senators who voted for the law, which received broad bipartisan support. House Speaker Mike Johnson called ByteDance's ownership \u201ca very dangerous thing,\u201d and said he expected a full sale to happen.",
      "\u201cI think we will enforce the law,\u201d Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "Legislators now stand to \u201clook a little bit silly\u201d if the ban doesn\u2019t last, Kreps said.",
      "\u201c(The case) becomes about the separations of powers, and checks and balances, that we don\u2019t have a king who decides what happens with the law,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cEnforcement isn\u2019t only up to the executive branch.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a message posted on X, listed a number of state and federal agencies, and private entities, that might be willing to go to court to get the ban enforced.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d Cotton noted.",
      "Despite the intense scrutiny and potential costs involved, the machinations over TikTok are in some ways just business as usual for the tech companies involved, according to Gus Hurwitz, a legal scholar with the International Center for Law and Economics.",
      "\u201cThe fines that we\u2019re talking about are civil penalties and companies risk civil penalties all the time,\u201d Hurwitz said.",
      "Still, the hard business calculus of complying with a law in limbo or risk defying a president who holds lucrative federal contracts over those companies could come into focus if shareholders sue.",
      "Oracle, for example, has a part of the Pentagon\u2019s $9 billion contract to build its cloud computing network.",
      "\u201cThis actually could be the right business decision to make,\u201d Hurwitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a breach of duty to shareholders.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been lots of questions about how companies such as Oracle and Akamai Technologies are powering TikTok\u2019s servers to stay online, while others such as Apple and Google have made the app unavailable for new users to download.",
      "None of the companies have responded to requests for comment.",
      "Oracle in 2020 announced it had a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global after securing its business as the app\u2019s cloud technology provider.",
      "Meanwhile, as of Monday night, a search for TikTok on Apple\u2019s app store directs to an online statement that reads in part: \u201cApple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,\u201d while Google\u2019s app store notes downloads for TikTok \u201care paused due to current US legal requirements.\u201d",

      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",

If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",

X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",

Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",

      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",

      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure and too few have it under control",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nothing doctors prescribed controlled Michael Garrity\u2019s dangerously high blood pressure \u2014 until they zapped away some nerves on his kidneys.",
      "If that sounds weird, well, kidneys help regulate blood pressure in part through signals from certain nerves. The new treatment disrupts overactive renal nerves.",
      "\u201cMy blood pressure would spike and I\u2019d run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d said Garrity, 62, of Needham, Massachusetts. He still takes medicine but at lower doses, his blood pressure normal for the first time in years. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, a major risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, even dementia. Many people don\u2019t even realize they have hypertension until it\u2019s done serious damage.",
      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",
      "Guidance from the American Heart Association urges would-be patients and experienced doctors to have \u201cthoughtful and informed discussions\u201d to decide who\u2019s a good candidate.",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday.

      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Alejandro Flores-Munoz owns a catering business in the Denver area called Combi Taco, or @combicafe on TikTok. TikTok helped him reach customers without spending money on marketing, he said. He was optimistic that TikTok would stick around until he heard Friday's Supreme Court decision.",
      "\u201cUp until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Sebastian Ray Serpa, a 16-year-old high school student from Volusia County, passes by Daytona International Speedway often and hears the roar of race cars from outside the gates but had never before been inside the \u201cWorld Center of Racing.\u201d",
      "After an immersive experience Friday designed for talented STEM students, Ray Serpa \u201cwill definitely\u201d be returning for next week's Rolex 24 at Daytona \u2014 his first ever motorsports event.",
      "IMSA arranged for 27 high school students who excel in STEM programs to come to the speedway to educate the teens on how many opportunities exist in motorsports for those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
      "Ray Serpa, who described himself as passionate about mechanical engineering, was blown away. He thought he'd like a future learning about how the human joint works. After stops at four different stations and a tour of the speedway and cars, he's now aware motorsports is an option.",
      "\u201cThis has been a real eye-opener for me,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI knew that behind almost every concept out there there were opportunities, but I never realized how wide that actually went. There are so many applications that require STEM skills. I heard from marketing people who went to school for mechanical engineering, and then ended up getting greater satisfaction from marketing. Or, they still work hand-in-hand. I would really like to get to a point where I can say the same.\u201d",
      "It is the debut year for the program in IMSA sports car racing, but series president John Doonan ran a similar STEM experience when he was head of Mazda. It took sponsorship from Gainbridge, Konica Minolta and EVERFi, which is working to develop the curriculum to continue the program, to launch it in IMSA.",
      "The students made four stops at the track: Tires, Traction and Tread to learn about physics and engineering at the Michelin Tire Center; Data-Driven Racing at the IMSA Engineering Center to learn about data, science and technology; Engineering Safety at IMSA Tech Inspection Area to learn about material science; and IMSA Technology Lab, with the IMSA GTP Hybrid Electrified Race Car, at Action Express Racing to learn about physics and engineering.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is a laboratory. It\u2019s a laboratory for the automakers. It\u2019s a laboratory for Michelin on the tire front. It\u2019s a laboratory for all these teams,\u201d Doonan said. \"For the students to be able to see what they\u2019re doing in the classroom, be applied in a real-world environment, that gives me and all of my IMSA teammates a lot of satisfaction.",
      "\"These students here, some of the top students from the Volusia County schools surrounding the Daytona area, they\u2019re our future. We are going to do it at five other races this year and then have a web portal to allow the educators and students to follow up. For me it\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d",
      "Doonan in his morning remarks to the students tried to prep them for what they were about to learn concerning STEM and motorsports.",
      "\u201cI told them, \u2018Look, algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, as much as you may dislike it at the moment, it\u2019s being applied here real-time,\u2019\u201d Doonan said. \u201cAnd when you say that to the students, the teachers all raise their hand and cheer and tell them \u2018I told you so!\u2019 And then the opposite side, I think, once the web portal gets established by EVERFI, the teachers are going to be able to leverage this resource in story problems and race strategy and aerodynamics, potentially, ride height, all the things that the teams are doing.\u201d",
      "Amy Monahan, a K-12 STEM Specialist for Volusia County Schools, said the students who attended were selected by their teachers for \u201cshowing tenacity in what they do on a daily basis.\u201d One of the students said prior to Friday he'd been thinking of enlisting in the military after high school but now wonders if there might be something in motorsports he can pursue.",
      "\u201cThis whole program is educating them to many opportunities are out there and this one is in your backyard. Some of them think the military or trade jobs are all that is available to them,\" Monahan said. \u201cThey don't know. Most of them have never been to a race, so seeing this and what it looks like, and understanding there are plenty of things to pursue is just a wonderful gift for them.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A decision on whether fire the inspectors general hasn't been made, sources say.",
      "President Donald Trump's top advisers have discussed ousting independent watchdogs -- known as inspectors general -- at multiple federal agencies, sources familiar with the conversations tell ABC News.",
      "The conversations began during Trump's transition period to the White House, but sources tell ABC News that it's not clear if or when the moves are expected to occur.",
      "A decision on whether or not to fire the IGs has not been made, and it's not clear how many of the watchdogs Trump would seek to remove, the sources said.",
      "Inspectors general can be fired by the president, but only after communicating a reason for the removal to both houses of Congress 30 days in advance. In 2022, Congress strengthened and expanded protections for inspectors general, making it harder to replace them with hand-picked officials and requiring additional explanations from a president for their removal.",
      "While the politically-appointed leaders of agencies and departments come and go with each administration, an IG can stay and serve under multiple presidents.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"It would essentially be removing this critical component of oversight and it really leaves the American public vulnerable to corruption and abuse of power,\" Faith Williams, the director of the Effective and Accountable Government Program at the Project on Government Oversight watchdog group, told ABC News.",
      "Trump installed political loyalists after firing multiple inspectors general during his first term in office -- including five over six weeks in 2020 -- in a move that was criticized by lawmakers and government watchdogs who accused Trump of attempting to erode safeguards and independent checks on the federal government.",
      "In April of 2020, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, telling reporters he did a \"terrible job.\"",
      "Atkinson's communications to Congress about a whistleblower complaint helped initiate the Ukraine impeachment inquiry against Trump, leading to his first impeachment by Congress. Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.",
      "\"I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report which turned out to be a fake report, it was fake, it was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine,\" Trump said. \"He took a fake report, and he brought it to Congress.\"",
      "Atkinson transmitted an intelligence official's complaint to Congress that centered on Trump's phone call urging Ukraine's president to investigate the Biden family's dealings in Ukraine. Democrats later impeached Trump for abusing his power in efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival, and for obstructing the congressional investigation into the affair.",
      "Trump said he fired State Department inspector general Steve Linick at the urging of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- who was being investigated by the office.",
      "\"I don't know anything about him, other than the State Department, or Mike in particular, weren't happy with the job he was doing,\" Trump said. \"He asked me if that would be possible, and I said, 'Sure, I'll do that.'\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Joe Biden fired the inspector general of the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, Martin Dickman, following an investigation into workplace harassment and abuse, according to The Hill.",
      "And President Barack Obama fired Gerald Walpin, the inspector general of the Corporation for National Community Service, in 2009. It followed Walpin's criticism of a Justice Department settlement with then-Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, who had been accused by his investigators of using AmeriCorps volunteers as chaffeurs and personal assistants. Johnson, a Democrat, had campaigned for Obama.",
      "Since 1978, inspectors general have been tasked with investigating waste, fraud and abuse across departments and agencies. Nearly half of the 74 inspectors general in the federal government are nominated by presidents to serve in nonpartisan roles.",
      "By law, an inspector general must be hired \"without regard to political party and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations.\"",
      "Currently, there are nearly a dozen vacant inspector general positions for Trump to fill, including at the Treasury and Commerce Departments and the National Security Agency.",
      "The inspectors general of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence resigned late last year, giving Trump the opportunity to nominate his own picks to lead oversight of the powerful national security agencies.",
      "While an inspector general lacks prosecutorial power, IGs can identify possible criminal behavior and refer it for prosecution.",
      "In 2021, the State Department IG determined that Pompeo and his wife broke ethics rules by asking staff to carry out personal favors. Pompeo defended his actions, arguing that they asked \"small, simple\" tasks of a \"friend\" who was a longtime aide.",
      "In the past, Trump has defended the president's authority to remove inspectors general -- but the move could prompt political backlash.",
      "In his first day in office, President Ronald Reagan dismissed more than a dozen inspectors general, and was accused by Republicans and Democrats of politicizing the roles, according to The New York Times.",
      "The outcry led Reagan to hire some of the ousted watchdogs back into their roles, Williams of the Project on Government Oversight told ABC News.",
      "\"I would hope that there would be some outcry now\" if Trump were to take action, Williams said. \"One of Congress's duties is oversight, and one of the ways it achieves that is by working with the inspector general community.\"",
      "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a longtime advocate for inspectors general, told ABC News that IGs are \"very important\" to support Congress' work as a check on the executive branch.",
      "\"Inspector generals are expected to be independent of political pressure, independent of the head of the agency, and to make sure the law is enforced and money is spent appropriately,\" he said.",
      "Trump's first transition team also contemplated removing inspectors general: In 2017, the House Oversight Committee obtained an internal transition team email with instructions to inform IGs they were \"being held over on a temporary basis.\"",
      "As president, Trump repeatedly complained about inspectors general and their work -- once calling it \"insane\" that the Pentagon IG's reports were publicly released.",
      "\"For these reports to be, to be given out, essentially -- forget about the public -- given out to the enemy is insane. And I don't want it to happen anymore, Mr. Secretary. You understand that,\" he said in a January 2019 Cabinet meeting to his then-acting Defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's first term and recent comments offer clues about his plans.",
      "Donald Trump returned to office as president on Monday, reassuming his duties as commander in chief. His position once again puts him in charge of the world\u2019s most powerful military, which -- often at his discretion -- can either engage in lethal warfare or act as a deterrent and a force for peace.",
      "How Trump behaved as commander in chief during his first administration may offer a guide for the next four years.",
      "In Monday's inauguration speech, Trump set the tone for a significant change in U.S. foreign policy that could have seismic implications for America's friends and foes.",
      "\"Our armed forces will be free to focus on their sole mission -- defeating America's enemies,\" he said.",
      "His recent comments about taking over the Panama Canal and Greenland -- refusing to rule out the use of military force to do so -- raised eyebrows, along with referring to neighboring Canada as \"the 51st state.\" He also signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as \"Gulf of America\" on Monday.",
      "\"It was an intent to grab that media attention and put himself at the center of the news cycle,\" retired Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told ABC News. \"This unpredictability means that all paths lead back to the Oval Office and his next statement.\"",
      "However, Trump's slogans about making America great and putting America first may soon bump up against his need for the world to see him as a dealmaker. The war in Ukraine has been raging since 2022, but he's promised to bring it to an end.",
      "\"Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" he said last August. \"I\u2019ll get it settled very fast.\"",
      "Trump warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that if the war doesn\u2019t end soon, Ukraine could get substantially more aid.",
      "At the same time, he has told Ukraine it won\u2019t receive more U.S. support unless it enters into peace talks. Last week, White House budget director nominee Russell Vought declined during his Senate confirmation hearing to fully commit to doling out $3.8 billion in aid that Congress has already approved.",
      "China's threats against Taiwan and international shipping may also embolden Trump to show Chinese President Xi Jinping that America believes it has the upper hand militarily.",
      "\"He will always defer to a solution that makes him appear strong and in charge,\" Lute told ABC News. \"So I don't think that there's an easy way to simply walk away from a big competition with China.\"",
      "The situation at the border between the U.S. and Mexico is also top of mind, with Trump declaring a national emergency in his inaugural address.",
      "\"I will end the practice of catch and release and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\" he said.",
      "The biggest difference in American foreign policy may be seen in the Middle East, and the war between Israel and Hamas. On Jan. 7, he created a deadline for a Gaza ceasefire deal in exchange for Hamas releasing hostages they took in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\"If the deal isn\u2019t done before I take office, which is now going to be in two weeks \u2026 all hell will break out,\" he said during a news conference.",
      "Then, last week, the outgoing Biden administration -- along with incoming Trump envoys -- helped broker a ceasefire and hostage exchange that went into effect on Sunday. However, the agreement is fragile and fraught with pitfalls. In particular, it remains unclear who will govern Gaza if the peace lasts.",
      "The images on the streets betray an uncomfortable reality. It\u2019s still the gunmen of Hamas in charge -- a situation unacceptable to the Israeli government. The Trump administration is also unlikely to accept Hamas being in control.",
      "Beyond Gaza, the situation in the Middle East has gone through considerable changes since Trump was last president. Iran, a major power in the region, has seen many of its allies weakened by various conflicts.",
      "Hamas has been left devastated and weakened by months of conflict with Israel. Lebanese political party and armed group Hezbollah -- designated as a terror group by the U.S. -- is a shadow of its former strength, with its leader Hassan Nasrallah  killed in an Israeli strike in September.",
      "Former Syrian President Bashar Assad also fled from his country, his family held power for more than 50 years, after his regime was toppled by a rebel offensive in December.",
      "Amid this new balance of power, Trump wants to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Such a pact could bring peace and stability in the region -- the Biden administration was working to broker this agreement prior to Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel.",
      "The Trump administration faces immense international challenges -- and America going it alone may not be a viable option.",

    "story": [
      "Trump announced the venture only hours after calling for an end to DEI programs.",
      "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced a major $500 billion private-sector initiative named \"Stargate,\" aimed at building an artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States though a partnership between tech giants OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle.",
      "Trump pledged to kickstart the initiative through an executive action that would utilize emergency declarations to fast-track production and simplify regulatory hurdles for participating companies.",
      "\"I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations, because we have an emergency, we have to get this stuff built,\" Trump said on Tuesday. \"So they have to produce a lot of electricity. And we'll make it possible for them to get this production done easily, at their own plants if they want.\"",
      "Trump's announcement came just hours after he signed an executive order titled \"Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,\" which aimed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within federal agencies -- while warning of future initiatives to curtail similar efforts in the private sector. The order directs federal agencies to end DEI-related mandates, policies and programs, calling such initiatives \"discriminatory and illegal,\" and it requires agencies to enforce civil-rights laws to combat private-sector DEI preferences.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's sweeping actions against DEI, all three of the companies Trump announced as part of the Stargate initiative have touted DEI programs and remain publicly committed to DEI principles, according to company websites.",
      "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has a webpage titled \"Commitment to diversity, equity & inclusion,\" where the company touts its DEI programs and its commitment to mitigate harmful biases in AI systems.",
      "\"Our investment in diversity, equity, and inclusion is ongoing, executed through a wide range of initiatives, owned by everyone across the company, and championed and supported by leadership,\" the website states. \"We take this work seriously and are committed to continuously improving our work in creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization.\"",
      "SoftBank President and CEO Junichi Miyagawa has also touted DEI initiatives, saying in a 2021 post on the company's website, \"It is extremely important that we ensure diversity within the core personnel involved in management.\" In a 2024 post, the company said that \"Promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion is an important management issue, and we strive to foster a dynamic and vibrant organization that enables diverse members of our workforce to fully exercise their talents, regardless of age, gender, nationality or disabilities.\"",
      "Larry Ellison's Oracle also promotes initiatives related to diversity and inclusion, with a page on the company's website titled \"Culture and Inclusion Empowers Diversity.\"",
      "\"If you ever find yourself wondering why diversity and inclusion matters, remember: It makes our teams stronger and our ideas better,\" the page reads.",
      "Representatives from OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment. A White House spokesperson also did not respond.",
      "In the meantime, the Stargate deal has faced skepticism regarding its $500 billion price tag -- including from Trump's own adviser, billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "In an overnight post on his social media platform X, Musk questioned OpenAI's financial backing, and later shared a post that called the $500 billion price tag \"ridiculous\" and said that \"no one should take it seriously.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's comments on X, rejecting his claim that OpenAI lacks the funds for its investment in the Stargate project.",
      "Altman called the assertion \"wrong\" and described the deal as \"great for the country.\"",
      "Altman also appeared to take a slight jab at Musk, who now heads the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, stating, \"I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies.\"",
      "\"But in your new role, I hope you'll mostly put us first,\" he added, using an American flag emoji.",
      "The Stargate deal comes as other tech companies have pulled back their DEI initiatives ahead of the Trump administration's actions.",
      "Earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced it was terminating its major DEI programs effective immediately, including as they relate to hiring, training and picking suppliers.",
      "\"The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,\" Meta's vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale, wrote in a memo obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms longstanding principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics.\"",

      "Monica \u2013 a medical doctor from Venezuela with temporary protected status who joined the lawsuit under the pseudonym\u2013 said she joined the lawsuit because she fears her future child will become stateless, as her home country facing an ongoing humanitarian, political and economic crisis.",
      "\"I'm 12 weeks pregnant. I should be worried about the health of my child. I should be thinking about that primarily and instead my husband and I are stressed, we're anxious and we're depressed about the reality that my child may not be able to become a US citizen,\" she said.",
      "Maribel \u2013 who joined the lawsuit under a pseudonym along with four other women \u2013 has lived in the United States for more than half her life after emigrating from El Salvador and Guatemala. She is due to have her third child in July but worries Trump's executive order will split her young family, the lawsuit said.",
      "\"She fears her unborn child will not have the same rights to citizenship as the future child's older sisters, and could even be subject to deportation, separating the family,\" the lawsuit read.",
      "\"Every day, babies are being born in the United States whose constitutionally guaranteed citizenship will be called into doubt under the Executive Order,\" the lawsuit argued.",
      "Liza and her husband Igor fled Russia to the United States for asylum, and they are expecting a child in May. They can't imagine being forced to bring their newborn back to a country that will likely prosecute them, the lawsuit said.",
      "\"Neither Liza nor Igor feel they can return to Russia without being persecuted, and they therefore do not feel they can apply for Russian citizenship for their child. Because of that, Liza and Igor are worried their child will be stateless,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Juana \u2013 who is two months pregnant \u2013 fears what the future might hold for her and her future child if they are sent back to Colombia if her asylum claim falls through, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"She wants her unborn child to be able to grow up without fear and with a sense of belonging in the United States. The thought that her unborn child could be denied U.S. citizenship and deported to Colombia without her is terrifying,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Trinidad is a Venezuelan immigrant who is due in August, but she fears that her child will be stateless under Trump's executive order, caught between Venezuela's democratic crisis and the legal tumult of the United States immigration system, the lawsuit said.",
      "Monica and her partner both have Temporary Protected Status after seeking asylum from Venezuela in the United States, but they are worried their child may be ineligible for both the United States and Venezuelan citizenship. Monica said she came to the United States in 2019 with her husband and thought they were doing \"everything the right way\" by paying taxes, working and buying their own home, she said.",
      "\"We had reached a point of stability in this country and wanted to have a child,\" Monica said.",
      "A happy change in their lives quickly devolved into fear, she said, when they saw Trump act on his promise to end the United States' promise of birthright citizenship with the swipe of a sharpie.",
      "\"This is a really difficult situation where I truly do not see a way out for my child, a way forward for my child to be able to get through this,\" she said.",
      "Because Venezuela no longer offers consular services in the United States, Monica said she is unable to explore the possibility of getting her child citizenship there. Her lawyers do not know if Trump's executive order would apply to people with temporary protected status, so determining if her child will be an American citizen meant filing a lawsuit against the president, she said.",
      "\"This executive order has just left us with more uncertainty than even before. Will my child be a US citizen? Will he be nothing? We just do not know what to do,\" she said.",

      "On his first full day in office, Trump ordered the closure of all executive branch diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and placed their employees on leave.",
      "ABC News spoke with Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, on Tuesday to discuss Jan. 6 pardons, the Laken Riley Act, and his meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [The senator, to better hear the conversation, used his phone to caption the questions he was asked.]",
      "ABC NEWS: In these divided times in Washington, we wanted to hear from a senator who has pledged to work across the aisle. Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was the first sitting Democrat to head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump. What was that meeting like? And what are his thoughts on the flurry of early actions?",
      "Busy day, first day for President Trump. I\u2019d like to start with the pardons for the Jan. 6 rioters. Of course, he's had sweeping pardons for roughly 1,500 of them, including some who committed violent acts against police officers. Your reaction to those pardons as far as the message that it might send?",
      "SEN. FETTERMAN:\u00a0Yeah, there were a lot of those pardons that day that I don't agree with any more than some of the pardons that President Biden dropped that I didn't agree with those as well, too. I actually agreed on a lot of the pardons that I've signed on as lieutenant governor. I believe in second chances. Some people are very deserving of a second chance and get a pardon. And there's some that I don't agree that do that. So I don't agree with, I don't agree with them. Many of those that I didn't agree with the president as well, too.",
      "ABC NEWS: Yeah. What is your response? Because I know at one point you had suggested that you thought that it would be a good idea for President Biden to pardon President-elect Trump with regard to the hush money case. Now, we know\u2026",
      "FETTERMAN:\u00a0What, what I'm saying, though, that, that, pardons I can agree with, some that I don't. And I think that's really what it comes down to.",
      "ABC NEWS: You obviously co-sponsored the Laken Riley Act, which was passed late yesterday. Some Democrats have said that they're unhappy with it, including Senator Kaine who said that it's bad policy. What's your reaction to that?",
      "FETTERMAN:\u00a0I mean, they're entitled to their opinions and their views. And I believe as someone that's very, very pro-immigration, as I have been consistently, that we can be very pro-immigration and we should need a secure border. And if those people that have a criminal record or people that are actively engaging in criminal behavior, I don't know why it's controversial that those people should, should, they need to go.",
      "ABC NEWS:\u00a0As you know, President Trump declared an emergency at the southern border. Your thoughts on that? Good idea? Bad idea?",
      "FETTERMAN:\u00a0Well, I think if 300,000 people were showing up on the border, as they were during a month, not that long ago, I think it's important that we create a secure border. And that's really pretty much where we are.",
      "ABC NEWS:\u00a0As you know, initially President Trump at one point had called you a raging lunatic, but then you went down. You're only the first sitting Democratic senator to actually go down to Mar-a-Lago. Days later, he said he thought that you were impressive. Can you take us to that moment and give us a sense of how that meeting went with you and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago?",

      "ABC NEWS: Well, I guess I'm wondering what made him go\u2026",
      "FETTERMAN:\u00a0I mean, there's many things that I won't agree with and there might be some that I do agree on that. But I am a Democrat and I'm going to remain a Democrat. So there's many of his ideals that I don't agree with. But that's pretty much how it works here. Some Democrats aren't going to agree with a lot of the things.",
      "ABC NEWS: Right. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, at one point, he's saying you're a raging lunatic. And then he describes you as impressive. Was there any kind of extension of an olive branch, a meeting of the minds at Mar-a-Lago that caused him to have at least such a shift?",
      "FETTERMAN:\u00a0You know, I think if we all refuse to engage and talk to people that may have said things in the past that you might not appreciate, then we wouldn't be having conversations with a lot of people amongst ourselves.",
      "ABC NEWS: I know that you've denied rumors that you would switch parties. Would you ever consider becoming an Independent?",

      "FETTERMAN: Well, a lot of things. A lot of things. But he claimed that that's what's coming and that's where we are on that. And we all have a choice to respond to every last thing or whatever. But I'm going to kind of continue to find a lot of consistent wins for Pennsylvania.",
      "ABC NEWS: Obviously, as we mentioned before, you were able to have the, the bipartisan bill with Laken Riley. Any other primary goals that you feel like you'd like to work, reach across the aisle with Republicans on, on upcoming legislation?",
      "FETTERMAN:\u00a0You know, as they emerge and continue to find and have those ongoing conversations with members of my colleagues here in the Senate. And remember, the Republicans are going to drive the agenda and I'm going to find a way to work together along on all of those kinds of priorities.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 13:02:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A former top prosecutor from the D.C. U.S. attorney's office called Trump's pardons for those charged in the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol \"disturbing.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It's disturbing because what it says to the victims,\" Alexis Loeb said.",
      "President Donald Trump's sweeping pardons and commutations for nearly all of the rioters charged with joining the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol was \"disturbing\" and an affront to the law enforcement officers who were assaulted at the hands of the pro-Trump mob, a former top prosecutor from the D.C. U.S. attorney's office told ABC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "\"It's disturbing because what it says to the victims, to the officers who put their lives on the line that day to defend the country, and also to the officers who then went and told their stories and testified in court \u2014 reliving the trauma of that day over and over and subjected themselves to cross-examination,\" Alexis Loeb, who oversaw multiple high profile Jan. 6 cases during her time as deputy chief of the office's Capitol Breach section, told ABC news.",
      "\"It's disturbing because of what it says about the rule of law and the message it sends about political violence being acceptable and attacks on the peaceful transfer of power, something that has distinguished our nation, being acceptable,\" Loeb said.",
      "Trump has defended his decision to hand down pardons and halt the ongoing prosecutions for nearly all of the more than 1,500 people charged in the four years since the attack on the Capitol, even in the face of criticism from some Republican Senators.",
      "Many of those pardoned were convicted in engaging in brutal attacks against the roughly 140 law enforcement officers injured in the attack \u2014 documented through thousands of hours of videos and police body camera footage \u2014 using weapons from bats, hockey sticks, bear spray and stun guns.",
      "\"I'm the friend of \u2014 I am the friend of police, more than any president that's ever been in this office,\" Trump said. Sixteen other Jan. 6 rioters had their sentences commuted.",
      "\u201cAs you know, we commuted about 16 of them because it looks like they could have done things that were not acceptable for a full pardon, but these people have served years of jail. Their lives have been ruined ..., \" Trump said at an event Tuesday night. \"They served years in jail. And if you look at the American public, the American public is tired of it. Take a look at the election. Just look at the numbers on the election.\u201d",
      "Loeb told ABC News Trump's pardons may have wiped away the cases and guilty verdicts against the rioters, but they could not erase the historical record of their many crimes.",
      "\"These were prosecutions staffed by career prosecutors and FBI agents of all sorts of political persuasions who came together and prosecuted these cases because they all recognized that attacking police officers was wrong, breaking into the Capitol was wrong,\" Loeb said. \"And what the pardons did do, was that they wiped away the verdicts and the sentences, not the historical record of what happened, but the verdicts and the sentences and the verdicts and the sentences were handed down by juries made up of ordinary citizens and judges appointed by both political parties, including several judges who were appointed by President Trump.\"",
      "After the attack on the U.S. Capitol by rioters seeking to overturn the 2020 election, more than 1,580 people were charged criminally in federal court, according to the Department of Justice. More than 1,000 have pleaded guilty. That figure includes 608 individuals who have faced charges for assaulting, resisting or interfering with law enforcement trying to protect the complex that day, the office said. Approximately 140 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot, the DOJ has said.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office previously said it is evaluating whether to bring charges in roughly 200 cases that have been referred to them by the FBI, about 60 of which involve potential felony charges involving allegations of assault or impeding law enforcement. Trump's executive order, however, appears to have completely shuttered the probe and the FBI removed from its website previous 'wanted' posters it had for violent rioters who had yet to be identified.",
      "At least 221 individuals have been found guilty at contested trials in U.S. District Court, the DOJ said. Another 40 individuals have been convicted following an agreed-upon set of facts presented to and accepted by the court.",
      "Some current and former DOJ officials have expressed alarm at the potential that the pardons could lead some now-freed defendants to target some of the former prosecutors who oversaw their cases, the judges who sentenced them, or witnesses who may have testified against them at trial.",
      "Loeb declined to say whether she was personally concerned about the threat of retribution from those she prosecuted, and instead expressed confidence in the integrity of the legal system that resulted in the rioters' convictions.",
      "\"The juries overwhelmingly found that the government had proved its case by a beyond a reasonable doubt, and the juries paid close attention throughout the trial and were just riveted by the video that came from all angles,\" Loeb said. \"These were some of the most documented crimes, I think, that we've ever seen.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday he supports \u201credemption\u201d and \u201csecond chances\u201d for Jan. 6 Capitol rioters after Trump\u2019s sweeping pardons.",
      "At his weekly press conference, Johnson was asked how Republicans can tout \u201cbacking the blue\u201d if they support pardons for those convicted of assaulting police officers during the attack.",
      "\u201cThe president has the pardon and commutation authority. It's his decision,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd I think what was made clear all along is that peaceful protests and people who engage in that should never be punished. There was a weaponization of the Justice Department.\"",
      "Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters received condemnation from some unions that represent law enforcement.",
      "\"The vast majority of Americans do not support letting those who assault or attack law enforcement off the hook 'scot-free,'\" the Capitol Police Officers\u2019 Union said in a statement. \"This use of presidential power is not what Americans want to see and it\u2019s not what law enforcement officers deserve.\"",
      "\u201cThe FBI Agents Association (FBIAA) strongly condemns acts of violence targeting law enforcement officers who serve and protect our communities. Accordingly, the FBIAA does not believe granting pardons or clemency for individuals convicted of such acts is appropriate,\" a statement from the union said Wednesday.",
      "The Fraternal Order of Police, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election, and The International Association of Chiefs of Police also criticized the pardons.",
      "\"Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety \u2014 they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law,\" the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police said in a joint statement Tuesday. \"Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families. When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence.\""

      "Two prosecutors were told to accept reassignment or leave the DOJ, sources said.",
      "Newly installed Justice Department officials on Wednesday tried to ease concerns within the department's National Security Division after two of the division's most experienced prosecutors were removed by the new Trump administration, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Sources said the move rattled some prosecutors, who are worried about what could come next for the branch that handles some of the nation's most sensitive matters, including cases tied to global terrorism, domestic extremism, foreign espionage and influence operations, sanctions violations, and leaks of classified information.",
      "According to one source, however, no more personnel changes within the division are imminently planned.",
      "On a division-wide conference call Wednesday morning, the acting head of the National Security Division, Devin DeBacker, praised the two prosecutors who had been removed, thanked them for their service, and gave each of them a chance to say farewell to colleagues, a source familiar with the call said.",
      "One of the prosecutors, George Toscas -- who has been serving in the National Security Division since its inception under the George W. Bush administration -- had been told a day or two earlier that he had two weeks to either report to a new immigration-related task force focused on addressing \"sanctuary cities,\" or leave the Justice Department, sources told ABC News. The other prosecutor, Eun Young Choi -- who has been with the Justice Department for more than a decade -- was given a similar instruction, according to the sources.",
      "As one source recounted to ABC News, both Toscas and Choi grew emotional during Wednesday's call, with Toscas talking about how honored he was to serve the National Security Division and how committed he was to its mission.",

      "One current official told ABC News that the Justice Department's \"brain trust\" of career officials was being banished apparently in favor of those loyal to Trump. Trump has for years accused the Justice Department of unfairly targeting him, saying in his inaugural address on Monday that his new administration will end \"the vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department.\"",
      "Former Attorney General Merrick Garland and other senior Justice Department officials have consistently denied such claims, insisting their investigations were fair and fact-based.",
      "It's unclear exactly what drove the Trump administration to identify Toscas, Choi and the other officials for removal. However, Toscas held senior roles within the National Security Division while the Justice Department opened many of the investigations that have for years incensed Trump and his allies, including the initial investigation into alleged ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and the more recent investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents after leaving office in 2021.",

      "But the nation's 47th president is already facing legal challenges to some of his most controversial executive actions and others have stoked outrage.",
      "\"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech on Monday. \"It's all about common sense.\"",
      "With those words, Trump immediately began rescinding numerous executive actions taken by now-former President Joe Biden, alleging in a written preamble published with his presidential actions that \"the previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government.\"",
      "Trump said his executive actions represent his administration's priorities of protecting the southern U.S. border, reforming and improving government bureaucracy and unleashing American energy by ending Biden\u2019s policies of climate and streamlining permitting that he contends has stymied energy production. Another goal, he said, is to protect women from \"radical gender ideology\" and recognize only two sexes, male and female.",
      "\"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" Trump said in his inauguration speech.",
      "In another unprecedented move, Trump signed his first eight executive actions in front of a wildly enthusiastic crowd filling Washington D.C.'s 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, capping his inauguration parade.",
      "\"President Trump has really made political theater a core part of how he uses unilateral power,\" Jon Rogowski, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago, told ABC News. \"He wants to make sure people know he has taken action that\u2019s consistent with the kinds of campaign promises that he made when he was running for office.\"",
      "What is an executive order?",
      "Executive orders are signed, official documents through which the president manages the operations of the federal government and provides instructions to the executive branch about how to interpret the law, Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University in Washington D.C., told ABC News.",
      "\"An executive order is a directive issued by the president that goes into the Federal Register. It has the force of law, but it does not require an act of Congress,\" Lichtman said. \"Although it has the force of law, it can be repealed by a subsequent president issuing executive orders of his or her own.\"",
      "Lichtman said that unlike laws passed by Congress, executive orders are more vulnerable to challenges in the courts, either substantive or procedural.",
      "\"The reason why we are seeing the government by executive order is twofold: Donald Trump was singularly ineffective in getting his agenda through Congress during his first term, even with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate during his first two years. The second reason is they have such a thin majority in the House,\" Lichtman said.",
      "In the past, executive orders were typically challenged after the federal government took action to implement them and someone claimed they had been harmed by that executive action, Rogowski told ABC News.",
      "\"Now, it has changed. Presidents are being sued immediately after they sign an executive order by organizations who represent collections of individuals or by states' attorneys general,\" Rogowski said.",
      "Rogowski said that during Trump's first term \u201cit became more common for groups and for states to directly challenge the president immediately upon the issuance of the directive with which they disagreed.\u201d",
      "\"Over the last decade, there\u2019s been more organization on the ground and among legal groups and states to put pressure on the presidential administration\u2019s use of executive action,\" Rogowski said.",

      "Trump on Monday granted 1,500 people convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon\" and commuted the sentences of 14 others involved in the riot. Trump called them \"hostages.\"",
      "The Constitution gives a sitting president the power to grant clemency to just about anybody and such actions cannot be reversed. Before leaving office on Monday, Biden issued a slew of preemptive pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including several close relatives, Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 committee, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney.",
      "\"What they have done to these people is outrageous,\" Trump said while signing the pardons and commutations in the Oval Office.",
      "The pardons and commutations immediately sparked a backlash from both Democrats, Republicans and the union representing members of the U.S. Capitol Police.",
      "\"The president's actions are an outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution,\" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement.",
      "Former Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., an ABC News contributor, called the pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters \"unsettling\" to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.",
      "\"They weren't 'hostages,' they were defendants. I was there,\" Katko told ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis on Monday night. \"A lot of people in the Capitol were beaten. I saw a lot of officers that were severely beaten and injured that night. It was a bad scene.\"",
      "The National Fraternal Order of Police, the union representing U.S. Capitol Police officers, released a statement, saying, \"The vast majority of Americans do not support letting criminals off scott-free or being given lighter sentences when they\u2019ve attacked law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Another controversial executive order Trump signed was one aiming to cut off birthright citizenship. Critics immediately pounced on Trump, arguing people born in the United States are granted citizenship under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment even if their birth parents migrated here illegally.",
      "Asked by reporters if he expected the order to prompt legal challenges, Trump responded, \"We'll see. We have very good grounds. People have wanted to do this for decades.\"",
      "Five federal lawsuits were filed already this week, challenging Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. One was filed in Massachusetts federal court by 19 Democratic state attorneys general, the city of San Francisco and the District of Columbia, accusing Trump of seeking to eliminate a \"well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle.\"",
      "A similar federal lawsuit was filed by the states of Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Illinois. The American Civil Liberties Union also backed another lawsuit filed in New Hampshire asking the court to block Trump's order.",
      "\"We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU.",
      "A separate lawsuit filed in Massachusetts U.S. District Court was brought by an undocumented expectant mother and two nonprofit groups, arguing the executive order is an attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to nearly every person born in the United States.",
      "A fifth lawsuit was filed late Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Maryland on behalf of two nonprofit groups, five pregnant undocumented women and their future children.",
      "In other executive actions, Trump issued a proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border, saying, \"America\u2019s sovereignty is under attack.\"",
      "\"Our southern border is overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans, including America,\" the proclamation reads. \"This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.\"",
      "Trump also issued an executive order designating certain cartels as foreign terrorists. He signed yet another executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",
      "Many of the proposed executive orders require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles.",
      "\"We have to relate as equals, not subordinates,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in reaction to Trump's executive orders pertaining to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum said her focus is on defending Mexicans and her country's Constitution.",
      "\"You have to keep a cool head with what he signed,\" Sheinbaum said. \"You have to read the decrees. In fact, we continue to study them because some of them went out very late at night and we have a team working on that.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said some of Trump's executive actions are similar to ones he signed during his first term, including the one proclaiming a national emergency at the southern border.",
      "\"There was cooperation between the two governments at that time,\" Sheinbaum said. \"When President Biden comes in, he removes it and now President Trump reinstates it.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Trump's executive action to prevent asylum seekers from entering the U.S. from Mexico is almost identical to the decree he made in 2018.",
      "As far as changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, Sheinbaum said, \"For us and the world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico.\"",
      "\"We will always act in the defense of our independence, the defense of our fellow nationals living in the U.S.,\" Sheinbaum said. \"We act within the framework of our constitution and laws. We always act with a cool head.\"",
      "Legal action could delay implementation of orders",
      "Rogowski said legal challenges could delay the executive orders from being put in place.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to undermine the chances that any of these could have real, tangible consequences for people, but I suspect Trump is going to find it frustrating that many of his actions that he intends to have an immediate effect are instead going to be held up in court for weeks, months or even years, in some cases,\" Rogowski said.",
      "During his first term, Trump signed an executive order that banned foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days, suspended entry to the country of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prohibited any other refugees from coming into the country for 120 days. Rogowski noted that legal challenges stymied the so-called Muslim ban for 10 months and forced Trump to issue two revised versions of the ban before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it in a 5-3 ruling issued in June 2018.",
      "'A lot of them are symbolic'",
      "Trump also issued an executive order withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, alleging the organization mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As he did in his first term, Trump signed an executive order removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to mitigate climate change that was enacted in 2016. Trump said the agreement doesn't reflect U.S. values and directs \"American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.\"",
      "Rogowski said some of the executive actions taken by Trump, like changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico and restoring the name of America's 25th president, William McKinley, to the highest peak in North America, are primarily \"symbolic.\"",
      "Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America \"is not going to advance any of Trump's economic goals or priorities that he outlines, other than make a symbolic change,\" Rogowski said.",
      "Lichtman agreed. \"They're symbolic in that they resonate with themes that Trump has been professing ever since he arrived in presidential politics a decade ago,\" he said.",
      "But Lichtman added that many of Trump's executive orders \"are real and they have a real impact on the American people.\"",

      "CASTAIC, Calif. -- Firefighters fought to maintain the upper hand on a huge and rapidly moving wildfire that swept through rugged mountains north of Los Angeles and resulted in more than 50,000 people being put under evacuation orders or warnings.",
      "The Hughes Fire broke out late Wednesday morning and in less than a day had charred nearly 16 square miles (41 square kilometers) of trees and brush near Lake Castaic, a popular recreation area about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires that are burning for a third week.",
      "Though the region was under a red flag warning for critical fire risk, winds were not as fast as they had been when those fires broke out, allowing for firefighting aircraft to dump tens of thousands of gallons of fire retardant on the latest blaze. By Wednesday night, about 14% of the Hughes Fire had been contained.",
      "\u201cThe situation that we\u2019re in today is very different from the situation we were in 16 days ago,\u201d Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday evening.",
      "Red flag warnings were extended through 10 a.m. Friday in LA and Ventura counties. Officials remained concerned that the Palisades and Eaton fires could break their containment lines as firefighters continue watching for hot spots.",
      "More than 31,000 people have been ordered to evacuate from the Hughes Fire, and another 23,000 are under evacuation warnings, LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said. There were no reports of homes or other structures burned.",
      "Parts of Interstate 5 near the Hughes Fire that had been closed reopened Wednesday evening.",
      "A 30-mile (48-kilometer) stretch of the major north-south artery had been closed for emergency vehicles, to move equipment and to prevent accidents due to smoke billowing across it. Crews on the ground and in water-dropping aircraft tried to prevent the wind-driven fire from moving across the interstate and toward Castaic.",
      "Marrone said that because winds were not as strong as they were two weeks ago, aircraft crews were able to drop fire retardant on the south side of the fire, where the flames were moving, he said. More than 4,000 firefighters were assigned to the fire, he said.",
      "Winds in the area were gusting at 42 mph (67 kph) in the afternoon. They had reached as high as 65 mph (105 KPH) in some mountain pockets by Wednesday night, according David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.",
      "Kayla Amara drove to Castaic's Stonegate neighborhood to collect items from the home of a friend who had rushed to pick up her daughter at preschool. As Amara was packing the car, she learned the fire had exploded in size and decided to hose down the property.",
      "\u201cOther people are hosing down their houses, too. I hope there's a house here to return to,\u201d Amara said as police cars raced through the streets and flames engulfed trees on a hillside in the distance.",
      "Amara, a nurse who lives in nearby Valencia, said she's been on edge for weeks as major blazes devastated Southern California.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been stressful with those other fires, but now that this one is close to home it's just super stressful,\u201d she said.",
      "To the south, Los Angeles officials began to prepare for potential rain even as some residents were allowed to return to the charred Pacific Palisades and Altadena areas. Gusty weather was expected to last through Thursday and precipitation was possible starting Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "\u201cRains are in the forecast and the threat of mud and debris flow in our fire-impacted communities is real,\" Supervisor Kathryn Barger said during a Wednesday morning news conference.",
      "Fire crews were filling sandbags for communities while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass warned that winds could carry ash and advised Angelenos to visit the city's website to learn how to protect themselves from toxic air during the latest Santa Ana wind event. LA County public health director Barbara Ferrer cautioned that the ash could contain heavy metals, arsenic and other harmful materials.",
      "\u201cEven a brief exposure can potentially cause skin irritation and lead to more serious problems,\u201d Ferrer said Wednesday, asking people to wear protective gear while cleaning up.",
      "The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong winds came as firefighters continued battling the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out Jan. 7. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 70%, and the Eaton Fire was at 95%.",
      "Luna said Wednesday that his department was still investigating 22 active missing person reports in both fire zones. All of those reported missing are adults, he said.",
      "The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the causes of the fires but has not released any findings.",
      "Several lawsuits have been filed by people who lost their homes in the Eaton Fire, alleging Southern California Edison's equipment sparked the blaze. On Tuesday, a judge overseeing one of the lawsuits ordered the utility to produce data from circuits in the area where the fire started.",

      "Police say a shooting at a Nashville high school has left one student dead and another wounded",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A shooting in a Nashville high school cafeteria Wednesday left a female student dead and another student wounded, nearly two years after another deadly school shooting in the city that ignited an emotional debate about gun control in Tennessee.",
      "The 17-year-old shooter, who was also a student at Antioch High School, later shot and killed himself with a handgun, Metro Nashville Police spokesperson Don Aaron said during a news conference. Police identified him as Solomon Henderson.",
      "Police Chief John Drake said the shooter \u201cconfronted\u201d student Josselin Corea Escalante, 16, in the cafeteria and opened fire, killing her.",
      "The wounded student was grazed by a bullet. He was treated and released from the hospital, Drake said. Another student was taken to a hospital for treatment of a facial injury that happened during a fall, Aaron said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police, federal and state agencies are examining \u201cvery concerning online writings and social media posts connected to 17-year-old Solomon Henderson\u201d as they work to establish a motive, police said in a statement Wednesday evening.",
      "Investigators at this point have not established a connection between Henderson and the victims, and police said the gunfire may have been random, according to the statement.",
      "Two school resource officers were in the building when the shooting happened around 11 a.m., Aaron said. They were not in the immediate vicinity of the cafeteria and by the time they got down there the shooting was over and the gunman had killed himself, Aaron said.",
      "The school has about 2,000 students and is in Antioch, a neighborhood about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of downtown Nashville.",
      "At a family safety center close to a hospital, officials helped shocked parents reunite with their children.",
      "Dajuan Bernard was waiting at a Mapco service station to reunite with his son, a 10th grader, who was being held in the auditorium with other students Wednesday afternoon. He first heard of the shooting from his son, who \u201cwas a little startled,\u201d Bernard said. His son was upstairs from the cafeteria but said he heard the gunfire.",
      "\u201cHe was OK and let me know that everything was OK,\u201d Bernard said.",
      "\u201cThis world is so crazy, it could happen anywhere,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve just got to protect the kids, and raise the kids right to prevent them from even doing this. That\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d",
      "Fonda Abner said her granddaughter had called her a couple of times but that she only heard commotion and thought it was a pocket dial. They spoke briefly before being cut off.",

      "\u201cUnfortunately, these measures were not enough to stop this tragedy,\u201d Battle said.",
      "She said there are questions about whether stationary metal detectors should be considered.",
      "\u201cWhile past research has shown they have had limitations and unintended consequences, we will continue to explore emerging technologies and strategies to strengthen school safety,\u201d Battle said.",
      "In October, a 16-year-old Antioch High School student was arrested after school resource officers and school officials discovered through social media that he had taken a gun to school the day prior. When he was stopped the following morning, officials found a loaded gun in his pants, police said.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s school shooting comes nearly two years after a shooter opened fire at a separate Nashville private elementary school and killed six people, including three children.",
      "The tragedy prompted a monthslong effort among hundreds of community organizers, families, protesters and others pleading with lawmakers to consider passing gun control measures.",
      "GOP lawmakers in the Republican-dominant state refused to do so. With the Republican supermajority intact after November\u2019s election, it\u2019s unlikely attitudes have changed enough to consider any meaningful bills that would address gun control.",
      "Instead, lawmakers have been more open to adding more security to schools \u2014 including passing a bill last year that would allow some teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns on public school grounds, and bar parents and other teachers from knowing who was armed.",
      "Antioch, a growing and diverse area of Nashville, has endured other prominent shootings in recent years. A 2017 fatal shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ killed one woman and wounded seven people. And in 2018, a shooter killed four people at a Waffle House.",
      "State Rep. Shaundelle Brooks ran for office in large part due to her son\u2019s death in the Waffle House shooting and was elected last year after the Covenant shooting. She said the Antioch High shooting reinforces the need for gun control reforms. \u201cWe must do better,\u201d she said.",

      "A suburban Seattle police officer is set to be sentenced Thursday for the 2019 shooting death of a homeless man outside a convenience store",
      "A suburban Seattle police officer is set to be sentenced Thursday for the 2019 shooting death of a 26-year-old homeless man he was trying to arrest for disorderly conduct outside a convenience store.",
      "A King County jury found Auburn police Officer Jeffrey Nelson guilty on June 27 of second-degree murder and first-degree assault for fatally shooting Jesse Sarey, marking the first conviction under a Washington state law that made it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers for on-duty killings.",
      "Prosecutors plan to ask the judge to sentence Nelson at the top end of the standard range for each count: 18 years in prison for the murder charge and 10 years for the assault, and run them concurrently, according to their sentencing memorandum filed with the court.",
      "\u201cDoing so will reflect Nelson\u2019s long history of violence towards the less powerful, the egregious nature of his conduct, his dishonesty, and the great damage he has caused in our community,\u201d King County Special Prosecutor Patty Eakes said in the memo.",
      "Nelson's lawyers plan to urge the judge to sentence him to the lowest possible range - six and a half years \u2014 arguing he served his community, was a valued member of his team \u201cand on countless occasions, placed the lives of strangers above his own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOfficer Nelson chose a career in law enforcement because he was driven by his sense of duty to others,\" lawyer Kristen Murray said in their sentencing memo. \u201cHe wanted to serve his community and did so for years, working to help people every day. That's all gone now.\u201d",
      "During his trial in June, jurors were told that Nelson had responded to reports of a man throwing things at cars, kicking walls and banging on windows in a shopping area in Auburn, a city about 28 miles (45 kilometers) south of Seattle. Nelson tried to get Sarey into handcuffs. He resisted and Nelson tried a hip-throw and punched Sarey seven times. He pinned Sarey against the wall, pulled out his gun and shot him. Sarey fell to the ground.",
      "Nelson\u2019s gun jammed, he cleared it, looked around and then aimed at Sarey\u2019s forehead, firing once more. Nelson claimed Sarey tried to grab his gun, leading to the first shot. He said he believed Sarey had grabbed his knife during the struggle so he shot Sarey in self-defense. A witness disputed that claim.",
      "The case was the second to go to trial since Washington voters in 2018 removed a standard that required prosecutors to prove an officer acted with malice \u2014 a standard no other state uses. Now they must show the officer\u2019s force was unreasonable or unnecessary. In December, jurors acquitted three Tacoma police officers in the 2020 death of Manuel Ellis.",
      "\u201cJesse Sarey died because this defendant chose to disregard his training at every step of the way,\u201d Eakes told the jury in her closing argument. The shooting was \u201cunnecessary, unreasonable and unjustified,\u201d she said.",
      "Sarey was the third person Nelson has killed in his law enforcement career. Jurors did not hear evidence about Nelson\u2019s prior uses of deadly force.",
      "Nelson killed Isaiah Obet in 2017. Obet was acting erratically and Nelson ordered his police dog to attack. He shot Obet in the torso and Obet fell to the ground. Nelson fired again, fatally shooting Obet in the head. Police said the officer\u2019s life was in danger because Obet was high on drugs and had a knife. The city reached a settlement of $1.25 million with Obet\u2019s family.",
      "In 2011, Nelson fatally shot Brian Scaman, a Vietnam War veteran with mental issues and a history of felonies, after pulling Scaman\u2019s vehicle over for a burned-out headlight. Scaman got out of his car with a knife and refused to drop it; Nelson shot him in the head. An inquest jury cleared Nelson of wrongdoing.",
      "The City of Auburn settled a civil rights claim by Sarey\u2019s family for $4 million and has paid nearly $2 million more to settle other litigation involving Nelson\u2019s actions as a police officer. Nelson remains on unpaid leave with the Auburn department."

      "The fallout from the alleged misconduct is still unfolding. In the first prosecution in the state believed to be impacted by Woods\u2019 work, a Colorado man in June pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the killings of three people in 2017.",
      "Prosecutors gave Garrett Coughlin the chance to plead guilty to second-degree murder partly because they were unable to call Woods to testify in a case that relied mostly on circumstantial evidence.",
      "The deal allowed Coughlin to avoid a possible life sentence for felony murder after his original conviction and sentence were overturned when it was discovered at least one juror lied during jury selection.",
      "Officials said Wednesday that the response to Woods' alleged misconduct had cost more than $11 million.",
      "Among those costs, the Colorado Department of Public Safety last year asked the Legislature for $7.5 million to pay for an independent lab to retest up to 3,000 DNA samples and for district attorneys to review and potentially reprosecute cases that are affected by lab errors.",
      "State officials announced Tuesday they had hired a consulting firm to review the state's forensic program. Bureau of Investigations Director Chris Schaefer said in a statement that the hiring of Forward Resolutions LLC was part of the agency\u2019s effort to \u201chold itself accountable\u201d following the allegations against Woods.",

      "A federal judge is set to hear the first arguments in a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the parents' immigration status",
      "A federal judge in Seattle is set to hear the first arguments Thursday in a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship regardless of the parents' immigration status.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour scheduled the session to consider the request from Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and a number of immigrants rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright, and names pregnant women who are afraid their children won't become U.S. citizens.",
      "The order, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could impact hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle.",
      "The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them.",
      "The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century.",
      "Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don't have at least one parent who is a citizen .",
      "A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he faced being denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasn\u2019t a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act.",
      "But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it\u2019s less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally.",
      "Trump's executive order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation\u2019s first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him.",
      "\u201cThere is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own,\" Tong said this week.",
      "One of the lawsuits aimed at blocking the executive order includes the case of a pregnant woman, identified as \u201cCarmen,\u201d who is not a citizen but has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent residency status.",
      "\u201cStripping children of the \u2018priceless treasure\u2019 of citizenship is a grave injury,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIt denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.\u201d"

    "summary": "Some U.S. House Republicans in California are breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson over his suggestion that federal disaster aid be coupled with as-yet unspecified conditions on the wildfire-ravaged state",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. House Republicans in California are breaking with Speaker Mike Johnson over his suggestion that federal disaster aid be coupled with as-yet unspecified conditions on the wildfire-ravaged state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- California Republicans are pushing back against suggestions by President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans that federal disaster aid for victims of wildfires that ravaged Southern California should come with strings attached, possibly jeopardizing the president's policy agenda in a deeply divided Congress at the outset of his second term.",
      "With Trump planning to visit the fire-ravaged state this week, resistance from even a few House members to his efforts to put conditions on disaster aid could further complicate an already fraught relationship between reliably liberal California and the second Trump administration.",
      "Several Republicans who narrowly won California House seats in November have expressed dismay that the state relief could be hitched to demands in exchange for helping the thousands of Californians in their districts still reeling from this month's disaster.",
      "\u201cPlaying politics with people\u2019s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,\" Republican Rep. Young Kim, whose closely divided district is anchored in fire-prone Orange County, southeast of Los Angeles, said in a statement.",
      "In an interview aired Wednesday night, Trump said he may withhold aid to California until the state adjusts how it manages its scarce water resources. He falsely claimed that California\u2019s fish conservation efforts in the northern part of the state are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should give California anything until they let the water run down,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.",
      "Local officials have said the conservation efforts for the delta smelt had nothing to do with the hydrants running dry as firefighters tried to contain blazes around Los Angeles. They said intense demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes was to blame.",
      "The wind-driven firestorms wiped out whole neighborhoods of Los Angeles County, left thousands homeless and killed more than two dozen people.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that discussions are underway in the White House to bring more water to perennially parched Los Angeles, alluding to rainfall runoff lost to the Pacific and the state's vast water storage and delivery system.",
      "\u201cLos Angeles has massive amounts of water available to it. All they have to do is turn the valve,\u201d the president said.",
      "California has long been a favorite target of Trump, who also referred to the fires in his inaugural address Monday. In LA, he said, \u201cwe are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.\"",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to change.\u201d",
      "Trump has made no mention of the multinational firefighting force deployed to contend with multiple blazes. Firefighters were gaining ground on the two major fires Wednesday when a third blaze broke out north of Los Angeles and quickly burned through hundreds of acres of dry brush.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican echoing Trump's complaints, has said there are \u201cserious\u201d problems in how the state is managed. Those include insufficient funding for forestry programs and water storage. He also noted the public dispute between the LA fire chief and City Hall over budget cuts.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass did not prepare the state or the city for what was to come. He particularly cited a 117-million-gallon reservoir left unfilled for nearly a year. Newsom has called for an independent investigation of the reservoir.",
      "Bass didn't directly respond to a question about possible conditions on disaster aid, saying in a statement: \u201cOur work with our federal partners will be based on direct conversations with them about how we can work together.\"",
      "Some Republicans have suggested that the congressional relief package could become entangled with efforts to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit \u2014 and with the House so closely divided, even a few breakaway votes from either party could alter the outcome.",
      "That leaves GOP lawmakers from California in a political quandary: whether to forcefully stand up for their home state, often pilloried by the GOP as representing all that is wrong with America, while Republicans in Congress are eager to show a unified front and parlay their November election wins into what Trump has called a new \u201cgolden age\u201d for the nation.",
      "Several California representatives agreed that the federal government must guard against the misuse of funds but argued that the money should not be held up or saddled with restrictions not placed on other states after tornadoes and hurricanes.",
      "The dilemma played out in social media posts by Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, who narrowly prevailed in November in his swing district east of Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are entitled to receive federal disaster assistance in the same manner as all Americans,\" he wrote on X. But, he quickly added, \u201cSome federal policy changes may be needed to expedite rebuilding as well as improve future wildfire prevention. Those kind of policies are not conditions.\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, whose sprawling district runs from east of Sacramento south to Death Valley, told KCRA-TV in Sacramento last week that Johnson's use of the word conditions was not \u201cespecially helpful.\u201d Speaking at the Capitol Wednesday, he said there is a lot of ambiguity about what constitutes conditions for disaster aid.",
      "He said his focus is to make sure the money doesn\u2019t get wasted through government inefficiency.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure the money actually gets to the victims and they can use it to rebuild their homes and to recover,\u201d Kiley said.",
      "Politicians in Washington have feuded for years over how to restrain the growing wildfire threat across the West. Republicans have long complained that inadequate land management practices have exacerbated damage from wildfires, while Democrats have emphasized the role of climate change and the failure of the federal government to address it.",
      "About the only thing they agree on is that the problem persists.",
      "Some lawmakers have noted that disaster aid over the years for Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana did not come with conditions. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries called the idea a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d",
      "Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, whose largely rural district runs from the Sacramento area north to the Oregon border, said he wasn\u2019t too concerned about talk of conditions.",
      "\u201cEverything has conditions, especially the way California wastes money,\u201d LaMalfa said. \"We want to help people and we want to help with that, like we\u2019ve helped with others. But California is very, very irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Trump plans to visit the state to see the damage firsthand on Friday. Newsom hasn't said publicly if he'll accompany him on his tour.",
      "With the fragile GOP majority in the House \u2014 there are 219 Republicans, 214 Democrats and one vacancy \u2014 Johnson cannot afford defections on any vote. And it could be several weeks before a fuller accounting of the state\u2019s recovery needs is ready and a formal request submitted to the White House.",
      "Following major natural disasters, the president typically makes supplemental spending requests, as happened after hurricanes Helene and Milton.",
      "Congress also could provide more disaster aid to California through legislation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he would work to include disaster aid in a filibuster-proof bill Republicans hope to craft this year that would pay for some of Trump\u2019s top policy priorities.",
      "Newsom urged Johnson and other congressional leaders to quickly approve assistance for the state, where fires are still burning and strong winds continue to threaten new ones. In an email to supporters from his campaign committee, he warned that \u201cRepublicans are holding federal aid hostage\u201d and said Democrats might be able to peel off a handful of GOP votes to push through an aid package.",
      "\u201cIn times of natural disaster \u2014 from Hurricane Katrina to Hurricane Helene \u2014 Americans have always stood together, setting aside politics to extend a helping hand to those in need,\u201d the governor wrote. \u201cHistorically, federal disaster aid has been provided without conditions.\u201d",

Tony Evers used his seventh State of the State speech Wednesday to urge the Republican-controlled Legislature to enact a wide range of proposals they have rejected in the past, including numerous gun control measures just a month after there was a school shooting not far from the state Capitol.",
      "Here's what to know about the speech from Evers, a Democrat who may run for a third term next year in the battleground state:",
      "Evers, without mentioning President Donald Trump by name, said \u201cthere is a lot of angst about what may happen in the days, months, and years ahead.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have always been willing to work with anyone who is willing to do the right thing for the people of Wisconsin,\u201d Evers said. \u201cAnd that has not changed. But I will not compromise on our Wisconsin values of treating people with kindness, dignity, empathy, and respect.\u201d",
      "Evers called for bipartisan efforts to address immigration and promised to fight any attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He also repeated his pledge to veto any bill that limits access to abortion, birth control, infertility treatments, or any other part of reproductive care.",
      "Wisconsin is one of 22 states suing the federal government over Trump\u2019s attempt to end birthright citizenship.",
      "Wisconsin is one of the \u201cblue wall\u201d states that Trump won in 2016 but lost in 2020. Trump carried Wisconsin in 2024 on his way back to the White House.",
      "Evers called for a series of gun control measures five weeks after school shooting just six miles (9.66 kilometers) from the Capitol that left a teacher and 14-year-old student dead. The 15-year-old shooter shot and killed herself.",
      "Evers called for universal background checks for gun purchases and restoring a 48-hour waiting period for gun purchases, a law that Republicans repealed in 2015.",
      "He also called for banning the purchase of \u201cghost guns\u201d and closing a loophole that allows for domestic abusers to own firearms.",
      "Evers also called for incentives and new requirements to safely secure firearms and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow judges to take guns away from people determined to be a risk to themselves or others.",
      "Republicans have repeatedly rejected the proposals in the past.",
      "\u201cWe cannot let common sense get lost in debates over whether basic policies could have prevented the most recent shooting, or the one before it, or the one before that,\u201d Evers said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t here in Madison to quibble about the semantics of the last shooting; we are here to do everything we can to prevent the next one.\u201d",
      "The governor last week created a state office for violence prevention, which Republicans vowed not to fund after federal funding runs out in two years.",
      "Evers, a former teacher and state superintendent of schools, also called for spending $300 million to provide comprehensive mental health services in schools statewide. That would be 10 times the amount the Legislature approved for school mental health services in the last budget.",
      "Declaring 2025 as \u201cThe Year of the Kid,\" Evers called on Republicans to approve $500 million to lower the cost of child care. The bulk of that would go toward funding the Child Care Counts program, for the next two years. Without more funding, the program \u2014 which was created during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 is slated to end in June.",
      "Evers also called for creating new programs designed to set price ceilings for prescription drugs and improve oversight of drug companies, removing the state sales tax on over-the-counter medications and capping the copay on insulin at $35.",
      "He also repeated his previous call for them to allow for voters to place proposed law changes on the ballot themselves through referendums, something that Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos declared \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d",
      "In an emotional moment, Evers welcomed the widow and parents of former state Rep. Jonathan Brostoff, who died by suicide in November.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Lawyers for Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs filed a defamation lawsuit Wednesday against a man they said had falsely claimed to possess videos implicating the music mogul in sexual assaults on eight celebrities.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, accuses Courtney Burgess and his lawyer, Ariel Mitchell, of fabricating \u201coutrageous lies\u201d as part of an effort to potentially profit off of the media frenzy around Combs, who was indicted in September on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Combs also sued Nexstar Media, saying its cable news network, NewsNation, aired Burgess\u2019 allegations without looking into whether they were true. The videos, the lawsuit claimed, simply don't exist.",
      "\u201cThese defendants have willfully fabricated and disseminated outrageous lies with reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d said Erica Wolff, an attorney for Combs. \u201cTheir falsehoods have poisoned public perception and contaminated the jury pool. This complaint should serve as a warning that such intentional falsehoods, which undermine Mr. Combs\u2019s right to a fair trial, will no longer be tolerated.\u201d",

      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A former Arkansas police officer who was caught on video beating a handcuffed inmate in the back of his patrol car last year has been arrested and charged with aggravated assault.",
      "Former Jonesboro Police Officer Joseph Tucker Harris, 29, was arrested on Tuesday on charges of felony charges of aggravated assault, filing a false report, and misdemeanor third-degree battery. Harris was released from a county detention center on $15,000 bond.",
      "Harris was fired in August after after he was caught on his patrol car camera punching, elbowing and slamming a car door against the head of detainee Billy Lee Coram, who was being transferred from a local hospital back to jail in Craighead County.",
      "A phone number was not listed for Harris, and it was not clear if he had an attorney in the case. An attorney who represents Harris in a federal lawsuit filed by Coram did not respond to an email late Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The federal lawsuit Coram filed against Harris, the city of Jonesboro and Jonesboro's police chief over the beating is scheduled to go to trial in May 2026. Coram's lawsuit claims his constitutional rights were violated.",
      "In a roughly 12-minute video, Coram is wearing a hospital gown and choking himself with a seatbelt wrapped around his neck as the car is moving. After the car pulls over, Harris opens the door and punches and elbows Coram several times in the face as he unwinds the belt.",
      "Harris later slams the car door against Coram\u2019s head. According to the federal lawsuit, Coram had been taken to the hospital after ingesting a baggie of fentanyl and had run away from the hospital when he panicked. He had wrapped the seatbelt around his neck to try and gag himself to dislodge the fentanyl he believed was still in his system, the lawsuit said."

      "A man who taped a sinister note to a Chinese ex-official\u2019s door in New Jersey was sentenced Wednesday to 16 months in prison",
      "NEW YORK -- A man who taped a sinister note to a Chinese ex-official's door in New Jersey was sentenced Wednesday to 16 months in prison. He was convicted of participating in what U.S. authorities called a Beijing-driven pressure campaign targeting expatriates.",
      "Zheng Congying was one of three men convicted at the first trial highlighting U.S. claims that China's government harasses and intimidates dissidents and critics on foreign soil. Beijing denies doing so and says its \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d is an effort to bring fugitives home to face justice.",
      "A federal court jury in Brooklyn found Zheng and co-defendants Michael McMahon and Zhu Yong guilty of playing various roles in seeking out Xu Jin, a former official in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and pressing him to return to his homeland. There, he would face bribery allegations that he denies.",
      "Zheng knocked on Xu's New Jersey door, circled the home to peer inside and left a note that read, in translation: \u201cIf you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That\u2019s the end of this matter!\u201d",
      "Zheng's lawyer, Paul Goldberger, said during the trial that Zheng later regretted what he'd done and tried to retrieve the letter. Prosecutors suggested he went back to the house just to see whether the note had been received.",
      "The defendants didn\u2019t testify, but their lawyers said the three believed they were aiding a private company or individuals, not the Chinese government.",
      "Zheng, a Chinese citizen, was convicted of stalking and stalking conspiracy but acquitted of other charges. A message seeking comment on his sentencing was sent to his lawyer.",
      "Zhu was sentenced last week to two years in prison. McMahon, a retired U.S. police sergeant, is due to be sentenced later this winter.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, has been waiting for a phone call, letter, email, text \u2014 anything, really \u2014 from the Trump administration that might say if he's getting fired.",
      "After all, Chopra is a Biden administration appointee. He's an ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one of President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite targets. Chopra has already packed up his office a few blocks from the White House. His picture no longer hangs in the lobby.",
      "But as of Wednesday, Chopra remains one of the more important regulators from the Biden administration who's still on the job as Trump cleans house. That's according to a person familiar with Chopra's situation who insisted on anonymity to describe his status. Of course, it was Trump who during his first term picked Chopra to be a Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "For a president who took office with aggressive plans to reshape Washington, Trump seems not to have fully communicated what he wants from Chopra's agency. Under his leadership, the bureau has tackled junk fees, limited overdraft penalties and removed medical debt from people\u2019s credit ratings. His continued presence on the job may speak to how Trump's desire to move quickly in taking control of the government can lead to some oversights, but also to the challenge of fully merging Trump's populism with his pro-business calls to cut regulations.",
      "Allison Preiss, a spokesperson for the CFPB, declined to comment on Chopra\u2019s job status. White House officials did not respond to questions about his status.",
      "As a candidate, Trump pledged to cap the interest charged on credit card debt and the bureau has privately done work on that issue should the president wish to implement his promise.",
      "\u201cWhile working Americans catch up, we\u2019re going to put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates,\u201d Trump said at a September rally. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cap it at around 10%. We can\u2019t let them make 25 and 30%.\u201d",
      "Under the law, Chopra serves a five-year term, which means he could stay on as the CFPB director. But he has publicly stated that he would leave his post if the president asked.",
      "The CFPB under Chopra has courted controversy with major banks and other companies who view its actions as being too aggressive. JPMorganChase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said at an American Bankers Association conference that it was time to fight back against regulators, saying of Chopra, according to Yahoo News, \u201cRohit is a very smart guy who has one major flaw, which I told him personally, which is that you use your brains to justify what you already think.\u201d",
      "Trump has made easing government regulations one of his cornerstones for growth, meaning that he might need to choose between his vows to companies and his stated commitment to easing costs for working families.",
      "The CFPB has several pending rules pertaining to restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers and phone numbers. It's also seeking to ban contracts that could cause someone to lose access to financial services for making political statements. The CFPB, meanwhile, is considering legal action against Meta, Mark Zuckerberg's company disclosed. It also in December published an order to supervise Google Payment Corp. as more financial transactions are going through people's phones."

      "NEW YORK -- Steve Bannon\u2019s trial on charges that he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S. southern border will start a week later than scheduled, a judge said Wednesday, after the conservative rabble-rouser hired new lawyers to pursue an aggressive defense strategy.",
      "Bannon, a political strategist and longtime ally of President Donald Trump, had been scheduled to stand trial Feb. 25 in the \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d case in state court in New York. It will now start March 4, Judge April Newbauer said.",
      "Newbauer agreed to the delay after summoning Bannon to court to quiz him about his decision to shake up his legal team. She rejected new defense lawyer Arthur Aidala\u2019s request for a month-long postponement.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been smeared by a political prosecution \u2014 persecution \u2014 for years, and I need someone who\u2019s a little more aggressive,\u201d Bannon told the judge during a brief hearing in Manhattan. \u201cI need every tool in the tool box.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, every tool in the tool box does not include delaying the trial,\u201d Newbauer said.",
      "Aidala said Bannon hired him and his firm \u2014 including former prosecutor John Esposito and retired Judge Barry Kamins \u2014 as attack dogs who are on board with his plan to portray the case to jurors as a selective and malicious prosecution.",
      "Bannon said he started shopping for new lawyers after he was \"shocked\" by Newbauer\u2019s ruling in November that prosecutors could show jurors certain evidence, including an email they say shows Bannon was concerned the fundraising effort was \u201ca scam.\u201d",
      "Aidala, a prominent New York City defense lawyer, told the judge that Bannon approached him about representation in December and, after initially declining, said he agreed to do so when his schedule freed up.",
      "Aidala also represents Harvey Weinstein in his pending rape retrial, also in state court in Manhattan. No date has been set, but the lawyer had been suggesting that Weinstein\u2019s trial go first in \u201cthe interest of humanity,\u201d citing the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s declining health.",
      "\u201cThey know that Mr. Weinstein is dying of cancer and is an innocent man right now in the state of New York,\u201d Aidala argued at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. He said he pleaded to prosecutors: \u201cCan I try this dying man\u2019s case first?\u201d",
      "Newbauer said that after consulting with the judge in that case, Curtis Farber, it didn't seem realistic to shuffle the order. But, noting her discretion over scheduling, she allowed for a one-week delay \u201cto give new counsel to have a better opportunity to prepare for trial.\u201d",
      "Bannon, 71, pleaded not guilty in September 2022 following his indictment on state money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges.",
      "Bannon is accused of falsely promising donors that all money given to the We Build the Wall campaign would go toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, prosecutors allege that the money was used to enrich Bannon and others involved in the project.",
      "Launched in 2018, the campaign quickly raised more than $20 million and privately built a few miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. But it soon ran into trouble with the International Boundary and Water Commission, came under federal investigation and drew criticism from Trump, the Republican whose policy the charity was founded to support.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg took up the case after Bannon\u2019s federal prosecution was cut short by a pardon that Trump issued in the final hours of his first term.",
      "Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state offenses.",
      "Early on in the fundraising campaign, Bannon pooh-poohed it, prosecutors said at a November hearing.",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t this a scam? You can\u2019t build the wall for this much money,\u201d Bannon wrote in an email, according to prosecutor Jeffrey Levinson. He said Bannon went on to add: \u201cPoor Americans shouldn\u2019t be using hard-earned money to chase something not doable.\u201d",
      "Two other men involved in the project, Brian Kolfage and Andrew Badolato, pleaded guilty to federal charges and were sentenced to prison. A third defendant, Timothy Shea, was convicted and also sentenced to prison.",
      "Bannon went to prison in an unrelated case last year, serving four months at a federal lockup in Connecticut for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. He was released in October.",
      "Aidala told Neubauer that Bannon\u2019s new legal team is in the process of reviewing about 11 terabytes of case files that prosecutors have collected and turned over to them, which he said someone told him \"would be like a U-Haul truck worth of material.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to roll up our sleeves and get ready to try this case,\" the lawyer said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly unusual where you\u2019d have the defendant and the victim both charged in separate instances with the same crime,\u201d Veith said by phone Wednesday. \u201cMy client is just happy his case is over, irrespective of what Mr. Santos is going to have to deal with.\u201d",
      "Santos declined to comment on Medina's case but said he had submitted a statement to the judge.",
      "Earlier this month, Santos asked the New York judge overseeing his case to delay sentencing until the summer so he could pay off more than half a million dollars in fines by making more episodes of his recently launched podcast \u201cPants on Fire.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is threatening to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn\u2019t reached to end the war in Ukraine",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump threatened on Wednesday to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn\u2019t reached to end the war in Ukraine, a warning that is likely fall on deaf ears in the Kremlin. The United States already prohibits the import of virtually all Russian products, and Russia has faced a multitude of U.S. and European sanctions since the invasion began almost three years ago.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social site on Wednesday, Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to \u201csettle now and stop this ridiculous war.\u201d",
      "He said he had no desire to hurt Russia \u2014 which he noted had played a major role in securing victory for the Allies against Nazi Germany in World War II \u2014 and has a good relationship with Putin, but warned of the penalties if the war isn\u2019t stopped soon.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t make a \u2018deal,\u2019 and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\u201d",
      "Trump has been skeptical of the billions of dollars the Biden administration provided Ukraine in weapons and other materiel to defend itself. He has often spoken of his desire to end the war and said on the campaign trail that he could end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office. That has not happened.",
      "The problem with the threat is that other than a small amount of fertilizer, animal feed, inorganic material like tin, and machinery, Russia currently exports very little to the U.S. that could be subject to tariffs. Oil had been Russia's largest export to the U.S., but such trade was zeroed out in 2023.",
      "The U.S. imported a total of $2.8 billion worth of these products from Russia in 2024, a tiny fraction of U.S. imports and a precipitous drop from 2023, when it was $4.5 billion, and 2022, when it was $14.4 billion, according to U.S. government statistics.",
      "And, Russia is already one of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned nations. Many of those sanctions relate to its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and were imposed under President Joe Biden, but others predate Biden. Some were imposed during Trump\u2019s first term in office, and some date back to Russia's 2014 seizure of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.",
      "In addition, \u201cother participating countries\u201d such as Iran and North Korea, the two most often accused of helping Russia in the Ukraine war, are subject to even more U.S. sanctions."

      "Other judges at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., spoke out against pardons for Capitol rioters before Trump's second inauguration on Monday, when the Republican president pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of charges in all of the 1,500-plus Capitol riot criminal cases.",
      "District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump nominee, said in November that handing out blanket pardons to Capitol rioters would be \u201c beyond frustrating and disappointing.\" Nichols expressed his criticism during a hearing at which he agreed to postpone a Jan. 6 riot defendant\u2019s trial until after Trump's return to the White House.",
      "During a hearing last month, District Judge Amit Mehta said it would be \u201cfrightening\u201d if Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes is pardoned for orchestrating a violent plot to keep Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election. Rhodes was serving an 18-year sentence when he was released from prison this week.",
      "Box, who was featured in the HBO documentary \u201cFour Hours at the Capitol,\u201d was found guilty of charges including interfering with police during a civil disorder, a felony. The judge convicted Box last year after a \u201cstipulated bench trial,\u201d which meant she decided the case based on facts that both sides agreed to before the trial started.",
      "Box was scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21. More than 130 other convicted rioters were awaiting sentencing when Trump issued pardons.",
      "Nearly 1,600 people were charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. More than 1,000 of them pleaded guilty. Approximately 250 others were convicted by a judge or jury after trials. Over 1,100 were sentenced, with more than 700 receiving a term of imprisonment ranging from several days to 22 years.",

      "Kollar-Kotelly said the heroism of officers who defended the Capitol \"also cannot be altered or ignored.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrossly outnumbered, those law enforcement officers acted valiantly to protect the Members of Congress, their staff, the Vice President and his family, the integrity of the Capitol grounds, and the Capitol Building-our symbol of liberty and a symbol of democratic rule around the world,\" she wrote.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Aaron De Groft, a former head of the Orlando Museum of Art who left the institution under a cloud in 2022 after it was raided by the FBI as part of an art fraud probe into more than two dozen forged Jean-Michel Basquiat paintings, has died. He was 59.",
      "De Groft died last weekend after a brief illness, the Neptune Society, a cremation service provider, said without providing further details. The Orlando Sentinel also reported that his wife, Kathryn Lee De Groft, had submitted an obituary to the news outlet.",
      "\u201cWe were saddened to hear about the passing of Aaron De Groft,\" the museum said in an emailed statement. \"Our thoughts are with his family at this time of loss.\u201d",
      "De Groft became executive director of the Orlando Museum of Art in 2021 following art museum administration jobs in Jacksonville, Sarasota, and Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "De Groft negotiated to have the Orlando Museum of Art be the first institution to display more than two dozen artworks said to have been found in an old storage locker decades after Basquiat\u2019s 1988 death from a drug overdose at age 27. Basquiat, who lived and worked in New York City, found success in the 1980s as part of the neo-Expressionism movement.",
      "Questions about the artworks\u2019 authenticity arose almost immediately after their reported discovery in 2012. The artwork was purportedly made in 1982, but experts have pointed out that the cardboard used in at least one of the pieces included FedEx typeface that wasn\u2019t used until 1994, about six years after Basquiat's death, according to the federal warrant from the museum raid.",
      "Additionally, the owner of the storage locker where the art was found, TV writer Thad Mumford, told investigators he had never owned any Basquiat art and that the pieces were not in the unit the last time he had checked it. Mumford died in 2018.",
      "At the time of his museum's exhibit, De Groft repeatedly insisted that the Basquiat art was legitimate.",
      "An FBI search warrant said that De Groft sent an email to an academic art expert when she asked that her name not be used in promoting the works because she didn't want to be associated with the exhibit. In the email, De Groft urged her to \u201cshut up,\u201d and he threatened to tell her employer that she was paid $60,000 to write a report about the pieces.",
      "\"You took the money. Stop being holier than thou. You did this not me or anybody else,\u201d De Groft said in the email quoted in the search warrant. \u201cBe quiet now is my best advice. These are real and legit. You know this. You are threatening the wrong people. Do your academic thing and stay in your limited lane.\u201d",
      "The FBI seized the paintings during the museum raid in 2022.",
      "In 2023, former Los Angeles auctioneer Michael Barzman agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of making false statements to the FBI, admitting that he and an accomplice had created the fake artwork and falsely attributed the paintings to Basquiat.",
      "The museum sued De Groft, claiming fraud, breach of contract and conspiracy. The former executive director countersued the museum for breach of contract and wrongful termination, saying he was being made a scapegoat. The board chairwoman and outside lawyers for the Orlando Museum of Art had signed off on the exhibit, even after the FBI had subpoenaed the museum\u2019s records over the exhibit in July 2021, De Groft said in court papers.",
      "De Groft's attorney, Robert Parks, didn't immediately respond to an email and phone call seeking comment on Wednesday. The Orlando Museum of Art said in its emailed statement that it wouldn't be appropriate to discuss the future of the litigation at this time.",

      "Maros Sefcovic referred to the idea of Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "These are common rules that allow parts, ingredients and materials for manufacturing supply chains to be sourced from across dozens of countries in and around Europe and North Africa to be used in tariff-free trade.",
      "But Europe Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons the government \"doesn't currently have plans to join PEM\".",

      "The Conservatives did not pursue PEM as part of its post-Brexit deal, but some  businesses have said it will help the UK rejoin complex supply chains that have been hit by customs barriers.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Sefcovic said the idea has not been \"precisely formulated\" by London yet and the \"ball is in the UK's court\".",
      "Under the Brexit deal, UK goods sold to the bloc are not subject to tariffs provided they are made with a certain percentage of materials from Britain or the EU.",
      "If a UK clothing manufacturer makes garments mainly from textiles it has sourced from Turkey - which is not in the EU - and sells them into the EU, the British firm would pay a tariff.",
      "But if the UK joined the PEM Convention - of which Turkey is a member - the clothing maker would not pay tariffs.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said joining PEM \"would reduce paperwork and costs for many UK firms as it would align rules and regulations on both sides in relation to the sourcing of components and raw materials used in exports\".",

      "\"We need to make sure that within the constraints of the vote to leave the European Union, we nevertheless do everything that we can to get rid of barriers to trade with our nearest neighbours and the people who we trade with the most.\"",

      "Single market treatment for UK food and farm exports would mean \"we would have to have the same rules and we have to upgrade them at the same time, we call it dynamic alignment\", he said.",

      "The scheme would allow 18 to 30 year-olds from the EU to travel, work and study in the UK for a period, \"with reciprocity for young UK nationals\", according to the European Commission.",

    "story": [
      "More than 100 Reddit communities have banned users from posting links to X in protest at owner Elon Musk's controversial arm gesture at a rally celebrating Donald Trump's return to office.",
      "The billionaire twice extended his arm out straight as he thanked the crowd for \"making it happen.\"",
      "Critics, including some historians, said it was a Nazi salute - Mr Musk has dismissed that, saying comparisons with Hitler were \"tired\" and \"dirty tricks.\"",
      "However many Reddit users have been unpersuaded by his response describing his actions as \"hateful\", leading the moderators of scores of communities - or subreddits - to stop content being shared on X.",
      "The BBC has approached X and Reddit for comment.",
      "Reddit relies heavily on community moderation, where unpaid individuals known as Redditors decide what is - and isn't - allowed to be published on their own corner of the website.",
      "They moderate subreddits, the name given to a forum within the Reddit platform which is effectively a community of people who gather to discuss a particular interest.",
      "Since the controversy erupted, dozens of those subreddits have decided they won't link to content on X, potentially reducing traffic and engagement.",
      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",
      "The BBC has independently verified that at least 100 subreddits have banned X posts.",
      "Of this number, more than 60 have at least 100,000 members.",
      "But the actual number that have instituted the ban will likely be significantly higher by taking into account smaller subreddits with only a few thousand members.",
      "And there are many more communities discussing a potential blacklisting.",
      "Who and why?",
      "The subreddits run by fans of football clubs Liverpool, Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur have all instituted the bans, as have communities for many US sports sides as well as Formula 1.",
      "The subreddits where residents of many cities and countries gather around the world - ranging from New Jersey to South Korea - have also blocked posts to X.",
      "And gamers are also amongst those to bring in the ban for video games including Baldur's Gate 3 and World of Warcraft.",
      "But while the blacklisting may have first started in some of these communities, it is popping up in a variety of places now where people gather to discuss all sorts of topics, ranging from RuPaul's Drag Race to Disneyland and even the military.",
      "While the vast majority of subreddits discussing a ban are in favour of it, there are some that have refused.",
      "The moderators of the Maine community for example say they won't institute a ban so long as \"the state maintain official accounts there\".",
      "And those running a group for people in British Columbia said they simply aren't \"doing censorship here\".",
      "Does it matter?",
      "Though there are many subreddits which already disallow posts from social media, those built around professional sports in particular may have a big impact on referrals to X.",
      "That's because sports subreddits generally get a lot of content from links to athletes, analysts and journalists who spend a lot of time posting online.",
      "For example, the top two most popular posts of all time on the NBA subreddits are screenshots taken from X, while three of the top ten most popular posts of all time on the AEW wrestling subreddit are screenshots from the platform.",
      "And gaming subreddits have a similar story, with the top posts on the Animal Crossing and Kingdom Hearts communities both screenshots from X.",
      "But that is not to say the bans will necessarily be permanent - Reddit is known for this sort of community movement to protest against wider issues, which doesn't always work out.",
      "In 2023, thousands of communities \"went dark\" to contest changes to how the platform was being run.",
      "Some of the biggest Reddit communities then began only allowing photos and videos of comedian John Oliver, following comments from disgruntled users.",
      "But this proved to be short-lived.",

      "Ms Coles warned there was a risk rising wages could lead to higher inflation and interest rate cuts being delayed, but added \"on balance, the lack of growth in the economy, and a month of falling inflation, are likely to mean a rate cut in February is still on the cards\".",

      "The UK has had worker shortages for various sectors in recent years. This can drag on economic growth, but can also lead to workers in those industries securing higher pay deals as employers seek to attract them or current bosses try to retain them.",

    "summary": "Lord Rose says it harms productivity but expert says hybrid work can be as good as full-time in the office.",
    "story": [
      "Working from home is creating a generation who are \"not doing proper work\", the former boss of Marks and Spencer and Asda has warned.",
      "Lord Rose told BBC Panorama that home working was part of the UK economy's \"general decline\" and employees' productivity was suffering.",
      "His comments come as some companies are calling time on remote working. Amazon, Boots and JP Morgan are just some of the businesses who now require their head office staff to be in every day.",
      "However, work-from-home expert Prof Nicholas Bloom said that while fully remote work can be \"quite damaging\" to some workers' productivity, spending three days out of five in the office was as productive as fully office-based work overall.",
      "Lord Rose, who was chief executive of M&S and recently stepped down as the chairman of Asda, said: \"We have regressed in this country in terms of working practices, productivity and in terms of the country's wellbeing, I think, by 20 years in the last four.\"",
      "In a November 2024 GB snapshot survey by the Office for National Statistics, 26% of people said they had been hybrid-working in the prior seven days, with some days in the workplace and some days at home - while 14% had been fully remote and 41% had commuted to their workplace every day (the remainder were not working in the week surveyed).",
      "The shift to working from home has transformed local economies. Industry estimates indicate that vacant office space has nearly doubled since the pandemic, a quarter of dry-cleaning businesses have shut down, and the number of golf games played during the working week has risen 350% - suggesting some people are mixing work and pleasure.",
      "Working from home is rapidly becoming a major battleground in the culture wars. The government is currently legislating to strengthen the right of employees across the UK to request working from home and says that it intends to make it harder for employers to turn down requests.",
      "But some employers - including government bodies - are battling with staff to get them back into the office, arguing that face-to-face interaction is essential to collaborative working.",
      "In some cases, such as independent record label Hospital Records, this requires negotiation between a young workforce - some of whom may never have worked full-time in an office - and their older bosses.",
      "Company founder Chris Goss, who introduced a new policy requiring staff work three days in the office rather than two, said he had \"a nagging feeling\" that remote working has affected the company's bottom line.",
      "\"I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships, and so the one single way for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person.\"",
      "Maya, a 25-year-old marketing manager at the company, said she likes being around her more experienced colleagues in the workplace. \"There's a lot of people in my team that are a lot further along in their career, so if I need help with something, you know, I can just ask someone.\"",
      "But she believes she would not be able to be in the office five days a week \"because my social battery drains and I need sometimes to be just at home and just to smash out loads of admin\".",
      "Prof Bloom, a Stanford University economist, said his research into working from home suggests employees in their teens and early 20s should probably be in the office at least four days a week to maximise their opportunities for being mentored.",
      "However, he said polls of tens of thousands of employees in the UK, US and Europe suggest workers valued the ability to work from home for two days a week about as much as an 8% pay rise.",
      "Employment rights minister Justin Madders told Panorama there was a growing body of evidence that working from home was more productive. He also said it was good for growth because companies will have \"a much more motivated workforce\" and \"if we're able to get more people into work because flexibility is available for them, that will help us reach our growth ambitions\".",
      "Prof Bloom may not be as optimistic about the effect hybrid working has on productivity, but he does agree that increasing the number of roles which can be done from home could help with economic growth if it encourages more people back into work, such as those with caring responsibilities.",
      "\"That is a huge boost\" and \"kind of a win, win, win\", because people would be able to work in better conditions, contribute to tax revenue and \"everyone gains\".",
      "One of the people who could benefit is Harleen, who was made redundant after she had her second child and has been unable to return to work because she cannot find a fully remote role that fits around her autistic son's routine.",
      "\"I am not seeing those jobs advertised. I'm not seeing anything that caters to that flexibility,\" she said.",
      "\"Every day I wake up and I'm thinking I'm living in Groundhog Day. All I'm doing is being a mother. I enjoy being a mum, but I want productivity. I start to feel like I'm just being brain dead.\"",
      "In the public sector, productivity is the lowest it has been since 1997 - except for the pandemic lockdown years - and some blame working from home. Since November 2023, civil servants have been called back in for between two to three days a week.",
      "But in several public bodies, including at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in Newport, South Wales, some staff are refusing to return.",
      "Ed, an IT delivery manager at the ONS and a rep for the PCS trade union, said he has worked almost entirely from home since the pandemic. He says it helps him to get his children to school and nursery and not waste time on commuting.",

      "\"We will never see this opportunity again. We have to fight for workers' rights.\"",
      "He and other union members are threatening to strike if they are forced to travel into the office 40% of the time. Civilian staff in the Metropolitan Police and union members at the Land Registry are also in dispute over policies on returning to the office.",
      "The ONS, which is in talks with the union, says it believes \"face-to-face interaction\" helps to \"build working relationships, supports collaboration, and innovation\".",

    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham, Southampton and Bradford. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "\"It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work.\"",
      "Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A.",
      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",

    "summary": "The Tory leader accuses PM of \"vandalism\" but Sir Keir says the Schools Bill will protect vulnerable children.",
    "story": [
      "Deprived children in England will \"pay the price\" of the government's changes to schools, Kemi Badenoch has said as she accused ministers of \"an act of vandalism\".",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative leader argued that the government's Schools Bill would cut pay for teachers in academies, close down routes into teaching and block failing schools from automatically becoming academies.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said academies had been introduced by the previous Labour government and were \"here to stay\".",
      "He said it was a \"disgrace\" that Tory MPs opposed the bill, which also aims to protect vulnerable children, set up breakfast clubs and limit uniform costs.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is a wide-ranging bill which includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",
      "However, it is the changes to academies' freedoms which have come under most political scrutiny.",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",

      "Landmark bill seeks to keep children safe, says Phillipson",
      "Badenoch used all six of her questions at PMQs to ask about the bill.",
      "She argued that academies - first introduced in the late 2000s - had led to improved performances by children in England, adding \"poor children in England now do better than wealthier children in Wales\".",
      "She told MPs the government's changes were \"wrecking a cross-party consensus that lasted for decades\".",
      "\"Teachers and parents will be horrified at just how bad this bill is. Even his own MPs may not realise it, but the bill will cut teachers' pay.\"",
      "Sir Keir replied that it was important for schools to have flexibility on pay and that the government had introduced an amendment to the bill \"to achieve that aim\".",
      "Currently, academies, which are independent of local authorities, have the power to decide how much to spend on teachers' salaries.",
      "The original wording of the bill would have changed this but for the last few weeks Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has repeated the line \"there will be a floor, no ceiling\" on pay.",
      "On Tuesday evening, the government agreed to amend the wording in the bill. Instead, academies will have to have \"due regard\" to the national pay agreements.",
      "Following PMQs, a Downing Street spokesman said the amendment to the bill was \"a sensible step to clarify our ambition for teachers' pay and conditions\".",
      "\"The amendment makes very clear the government's intention to set a floor on pay but no ceiling so that all state school teachers can rely on the core pay offer,\" he added.",
      "The Confederation of School Trusts welcomed the changes - but said there were still parts of the bill that concerned them, including restrictions on bringing people with specialist subject knowledge (but not a specific formal teaching qualification) into the classroom.",
      "Badenoch told the Commons that the bill implies \"doctors are not sufficiently qualified to teach biology, that Olympic medallists can not teach PE\", and asked why the prime minister was closing routes into teaching.",
      "\"She knows that's not right,\" Sir Keir replied but added that it \"should not be extraordinary\" to suggest that teachers in schools should be qualified.",
      "Badenoch also criticised the bill for removing a guarantee that failing schools would automatically be turned into academies.",
      "\"It is an attack on excellence. It is an attack on higher standards. It is an attack on aspiration,\" she said.",
      "Sir Keir said his government was committed to academies and repeated his attack on Conservative MPs for voting against a bill which included \"vital protections for children\".",
      "\"The bill benefits children who need the nourishment of a breakfast club, the bill benefits the families that can't afford uniforms, the bill benefits the children who are currently out of school and nobody knows where they are, the bill benefits the children who could be taken out of school by abusers if this bill doesn't go through.\"",
      "He said the opposition leader should \"change her mind\" and back the measures.",
      "The subject of academies is one where the Conservatives are united and keen to defend their record, with one shadow cabinet minister telling the BBC: \"It's one of the few clear success stories we have to tell.\"",
      "Academy schools were first introduced under Sir Tony Blair and enthusiastically expanded by the Conservatives when they came to power in 2010.",
      "So far only one Labour MP - Siobhain McDonagh - has publicly criticised the bill, however it is privately causing significant anxiety among Labour MPs, generally on the right of the party, who are proud of academies.",
      "These are predominantly MPs who are loyal to the government anyway and would not vote against this legislation, which is expected to become law by spring."

Cambridge University Press and Assessment (CUP&A), one of the UK's biggest exam providers, has been setting papers since the 1850s and its English exams have now been taken by more than 100 million people around the world. But today's exam is very different to that very first paper.",

      "(f) The lyrical gifts of Shakespeare are woven into the actual language of the characters.",
      "The exam comprised a series of papers on phonetics, grammar, and translation, which took 12 hours to complete.",
      "\"At first, it was an exam for a small elite who wanted to study English as an academic subject, like Latin or Ancient Greek,\" says Dr Evelina Galaczi, director of research at CUP&A.",
      "\"At the time, grammar and translation were considered the most important thing, but now the exam is much more about using English to communicate.",
      "\"The shift was gradual, but in the Second World War English became a global language and so speaking and pronunciation became much more important.",
      "\"That was a catalyst for change, and I firmly believe that learning English opens doors.\"",
      "By the 1950s, there had been requests for the English exam to offer translation questions in dozens of different languages, ranging from Arabic to Vietnamese.",

      "\"It might be one of the reasons why the translation paper was dropped in the 1970s.\"",
      "The Cambridge English exam has continued to evolve.",
      "There are now different versions tailored to the needs of schools, higher education, and businesses.",
      "\"More than 100 million people across 130 countries have now sat our English exams,\" says marketing director for higher education, Ian Cook.",

      "\"Some universities in Germany, Sweden, and East Asia, for example, deliver IT and healthcare courses in English in order to attract the best candidates and so students need to show they have the language skills to cope with the course.\"",

      "\"That our children seem to be experiencing some kind of happiness recession at the moment is not surprising, and I believe that the decline in reading has played its part in this.\"",

      "A man has been left frustrated after having to apply for a mainstream school for his autistic son, because a council missed a care plan deadline.",
      "Kray's four-year-old son Bodhi has not had an education, health and care plan (EHCP) issued by Birmingham City Council, which is needed to apply for a special school place.",
      "\"He's entitled to an education, so for him to just get pushed back when we've done everything right is just annoying\", said Kray.",
      "Birmingham City Council said it was \"working hard to ensure decisions are timely and EHCPs deliver quality\".",
      "Kray, who runs 670 Grams in Digbeth, Birmingham, said Bodhi was seen by a paediatrician in February 2024, who then referred him for an autism assessment and an educational healthcare needs assessment.",
      "Councils have a legal time limit of 20 weeks, in most cases, to issue an EHCP or explain why the bid has been rejected after a professional asks for an assessment, but growing demand and insufficient funding is resulting in delays.",
      "The 33-year-old said without an EHCP he could not apply for a specialist school before the window for school applications closed this month.",
      "Kray said he felt a mainstream school would not be able to cope with his son.",
      "Bodhi displays many of the signs of autism including not speaking, not responding to his name, not being able to sit still and not interacting with other children or adults.",
      "Both he and his wife Sacha, who is also a chef, first started noticing the signs when he was one year old, and his nursery picked up on it too.",
      "Now that the school application window has closed, they fear they have missed their opportunity to get him a place at a specialist school, many of which are oversubscribed.",
      "Their concern is that if the school they have applied to cannot cope with Bodhi, he will be out of school and will have to be educated at home.",
      "For the couple, who have three young children and work full-time running their Michelin-listed restaurant, home-schooling is not a viable option.",
      "\"Obviously the children come first but we need that business to just live a nice life,\" said Kray.",
      "Data from the Department for Education shows that hundreds of other children in Birmingham are also facing delays to the support they need.",
      "In 2023 the city council's rate for getting EHCPs issued on time was 58.9% (652 of 1,107).",
      "That was better than the national average for that year, which was 49.1%",
      "To give Bodhi the best possible chance of getting into a good specialist school, the family have now moved out of Birmingham to Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, and have asked the local county council for the educational needs assessment.",
      "But without the EHCP they are in the same position as they were in Birmingham.",
      "Sacha said she wondered how anyone got their children into a specialist school from reception age.",
      "The 29-year-old said they had begun the process to see a paediatrician when Bodhi was two and did everything their end as quickly as possible.",

    "story": [
      "The Oscar nominations will be announced later, in an exciting year for the film awards race where there is no consensus frontrunner for best picture.",
      "Blockbusters such as Wicked and Dune: Part Two will compete with Emilia P\u00e9rez, Conclave, A Complete Unknown, The Brutalist and Anora when the shortlists are released at 13:30 GMT.",
      "The nominations were due to be announced last week, but were postponed after the voting period was extended due to the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "The Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by US comic Conan O'Brien, will take place on 2 March.",
      "There are two musicals, two massive pop stars, two Sebastian Stan films, two actors from Succession and several comeback queens in the race this year.",
      "Here are a few things to look out for when the Academy announces its nominations.",
      "Comeback queens",
      "Comeback narratives are strong this year, particularly in the best actress category where many contenders have returned after years away from the awards race.",
      "One of the frontrunners is The Substance star Demi Moore, for playing a woman who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself.",
      "Equally, there is a huge amount of affection towards Pamela Anderson, who has already scored surprise SAG and Golden Globe nominations for her vulnerable and powerful performance in The Last Showgirl as an ageing Las Vegas performer.",
      "Marianne Jean-Baptiste has an outside chance at a nomination for playing a constantly miserable woman in Mike Leigh's Hard Truths, nearly three decades after her first nomination for their previous collaboration Secrets & Lies.",
      "Even Angelina Jolie arguably has a comeback narrative. Although she has remained in the spotlight in recent years, her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas is her first Oscar contender for some time. She has lost momentum in recent weeks, however, after missing a nomination at other major ceremonies.",
      "A double dose of Sebastian Stan",
      "Over in the best actor category, Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) is expected to return to the race for his performance as a Hungarian architect hired by a wealthy American after World War Two. Brody was last nominated in 2003, when he won for The Pianist.",
      "Other contenders include Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) for his portrayal as Bob Dylan in the early 1960s, and Colman Domingo (Sing Sing) for playing a prison inmate who takes part in an performing arts programme.",
      "Possible British nominees include Ralph Fiennes (Conclave), for his role as a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope, and Daniel Craig (Queer), who plays a gay man who ventures into the jungle in search of a plant with telepathic qualities.",
      "Sebastian Stan has two possible chances for a nomination - one for playing a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice, and another for the Golden Globe-winning A Different Man, for his role as an aspiring actor who radically changes his appearance.",
      "Pop princesses",
      "Two of the biggest pop stars of the last 15 years could be recognised in the best supporting actress category. Ariana Grande is a dead-cert for her performance in Wicked as Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Another possible (but less certain) nominee is Selena Gomez for her role in Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez as the wife of a Mexican drug lord who changes gender.",
      "Her co-star Zoe Salda\u00f1a is the current frontrunner to win the category. She took home the Golden Globe earlier this month and has a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel films.",
      "But it's a crowded category, with Felicity Jones (The Brutalist), Isabella Rossellini (Conclave), Monica Barbaro (A Complete Unknown) and Jamie Lee Curtis (The Last Showgirl) also in the running.",
      "Danielle Deadwyler (The Piano Lesson), Margaret Qualley (The Substance) and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor (Nickel Boys) could also show up. This category is particularly hard to predict due to different actresses being nominated at different precursor events.",
      "Succession success",
      "The frontrunner in the best supporting actor category is Kieran Culkin, who is best known for his role as the snarky Roman Roy in HBO's Succession.",
      "He could score a nomination for his performance in the excellent A Real Pain, about two cousins who travel across Poland in remembrance of their grandmother.",
      "But one of Culkin's competitors is his own Succession co-star Jeremy Strong, who could be recognised for his terrific performance in The Apprentice as lawyer Roy Cohn, who mentored Donald Trump in his early years as a real estate tycoon.",
      "The pair could be joined in the best supporting actor category by Yura Borisov (Anora), Guy Pearce (The Brutalist), Clarence Maclin (Sing Sing), and Edward Norton (A Complete Unknown).",
      "And what about Culkin and Strong's on-screen sister Sarah Snook? Well, she has a film in the awards race too, although not in the acting categories. The Australian voices the main character in the beguiling animated film Memoir of a Snail.",
      "Competitive categories",
      "Jolie, Moore, Anderson and Jean-Baptiste may have comeback narratives, but they are competing in a particularly crowded lead actress category this year.",
      "Other frontrunners include Mikey Madison (Anora) for her barnstorming performance as a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "She could be joined by Cynthia Erivo (Wicked) for her role as the Wizard of Oz character Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. The British actress is an Oscar win away from achieving EGOT status.",
      "Golden Globe winner Fernanda Torres (I'm Still Here) could make it in for her understated portrayal of a Brazilian woman who investigates the disappearance of her congressman husband.",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n (Emilia P\u00e9rez) is also likely to be recognised for playing a Mexican cartel leader who leaves the world of crime to live a new life as a trans woman.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n would become the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category. There is one caveat - Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, but that was more than a decade before the actor transitioned.",
      "Why will Robbie Williams miss out?",
      "Robbie Williams had a good chance of an Oscar nomination this year thanks to Better Man, the biopic which sees him depicted as a CGI chimpanzee.",
      "The singer made the 15-strong shortlist in the best original song category for his track Forbidden Road, taken from the film's soundtrack.",
      "But sadly he will not be one of the final five nominees, after the song was disqualified for \"incorporating material from an existing song that was not written\" for the film.",
      "It's understood Forbidden Road was considered too similar to I Got A Name, performed by Jim Croce in the 1973 film The Last American Hero.",
      "One of the writers of I Got A Name was Charles Fox, who, five decades later, is now one of the three governors of the Academy's music branch.",
      "Instead, songs from The Six Triple Eight, Challengers, The Wild Robot, Blitz and two numbers from Emilia P\u00e9rez could be nominated.",
      "Fresh faces in best director",
      "Established directors such as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson often tend to populate this category, understandably cropping up at the Oscars again and again.",
      "This year, however, all of the major contenders for best director would be first-time Oscar nominees.",
      "Brady Corbet (The Brutalist), Edward Berger (Conclave), Jacques Audiard (Emilia P\u00e9rez) and Sean Baker (Anora) are all likely to be recognised.",
      "They could be joined by Coralie Fargeat (The Substance), RaMell Ross (Nickel Boys)  and James Mangold (A Complete Unknown).",
      "Even the less likely contenders, such as Jon M Chu (Wicked), Denis Villeneuve (Dune: Part Two), Mohammad Rasoulof (The Seed of the Sacred Fig) and Payal Kapadia (All We Imagine As Light), would be first-time nominees in the category.",
      "Big blockbusters",
      "We may not have Barbie this year, but there are plenty of other blockbusters which could show up at the Oscars.",
      "Box office smashes in 2024 included Wicked, which almost certainly will be nominated for best picture, and Gladiator II, which almost certainly won't be.",
      "Other sequels which cleaned up financially include Dune: Part Two, the second instalment of the sandy sci-fi adaptation, which is likely to be nominated for best picture as well as several technical prizes.",
      "Elsewhere, Inside Out 2, the highest-grossing film of last year, will likely make the best animated film category, alongside the popular The Wild Robot.",
      "But box office takings aren't everything. Both animated films could be beaten by a much smaller contender, the charming Latvian film Flow, about a cat who must work with other animals to survive after a flood, which won the Golden Globe.",
      "Why is best picture so hard to predict?",
      "Often with the Oscars, there is a clear best picture winner which steamrolls its way through awards season, such as Oppenheimer in 2024. This year, however, is wide open.",
      "Different films have been winning prizes at the various events which precede the Oscars. There are six contenders which feasibly could take the top prize, depending on how the next few weeks shake out.",
      "The Brutalist and Emilia P\u00e9rez won the two top film awards at the Golden Globes, and both have a lot of passionate supporters.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave and Anora are widely liked and less divisive than some other contenders, and could therefore benefit from the preferential ballot system, where voters rank the nominated films in order of preference.",
      "Less likely but still possible winners include A Complete Unknown, which had a particularly strong showing at the SAG nominations, and Wicked, which is likely to be heavily nominated and is one of the most successful films financially.",
      "How to watch the Oscar nominations",
      "Nominations will be announced at 13:30 GMT and will be streamed on the BBC News live page, as well as the Academy's official website and social channels.",
      "The event has been scaled down due to the LA wildfires, and will now be made virtually without the usual audience of journalists.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 11:26:55 GMT",
    "summary": "The song, recorded for inclusion on Turner's hit album Private Dancer, was recently uncovered.",
    "story": [
      "A song recorded for Tina Turner's blockbuster album Private Dancer, that was presumed lost, has been rediscovered and received its first play on BBC Radio 2.",
      "Hot For You, Baby, was cut at Capitol Studios in Hollywood and originally intended to be an album track.",
      "But it was ultimately jettisoned in favour of era-defining pop hits such What's Love Got To Do With It, Better Be Good To Me and the album's title track.",
      "Presumed missing, the master tape was recently rediscovered as her record label compiled a 40th anniversary re-release of Private Dancer.",
      "An up-tempo rocker, full of showboating guitar chords and an extremely 1980s cowbell, Hot For You, Baby is a prime example of Turner's raspy, physical style of soul.",
      "The track was played on the Radio 2 Breakfast Show on Thursday, at 08:50 GMT.",
      "Produced by John Grant, the record executive who masterminded her mid-career comeback, it was written by Australian musicians George Young and Harry Vanda.",
      "It had already been recorded once by Scottish-Australian singer John Paul Young, the voice behind disco classic Love Is In The Air.",
      "However, his version largely flew under the radar when it was released in 1979.",
      "Private Dancer, released in May 1984, launched an unprecedented second act in Tina Turner's career.",
      "She had escaped an abusive marriage to musician Ike Turner at the end of the 1970s, but the divorce left her penniless, living off food stamps and playing ill-conceived cabaret shows to pay her debts.",
      "The music industry had largely written her off - but in England, where pop was in thrall to American R&B, she still had some heavyweight fans.",
      "In 1981, Rod Stewart invited Turner to play with him on Saturday Night Live; and the Rolling Stones asked her to be part of their US tour. More importantly, perhaps, David Bowie told Capitol Records that Turner was his favourite singer.",
      "A landmark album",
      "But the turning point came when she hooked up with British producers Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, of the band Heaven 17, to record a synth-pop version of  the Temptations' 1970 hit Ball of Confusion.",
      "A huge hit in Europe, its success persuaded Capitol to let her record an album, but they hardly threw their weight behind it.",
      "The budget only paid for two weeks in the studio, and many of the songs Turner recorded were other artists' cast-offs (both Cliff Richard and Bucks Fizz had turned down What's Love Got To Do With It).",
      "But she used her time wisely - recording all but one of Private Dancer's songs in the UK with five different British production teams.",
      "With the country in the grips of new wave and the new romantics, Turner was steered away from raw, fiery soul that first made her famous. But somehow, her electrifying vocals were a perfect fit for the chilly, programmed grooves she was given.",
      "\"Turner seems to completely understand the touch that each of these songs needed,\" wrote Debby Miller, in a contemporaneous review of Private Dancer for Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "In the New York Times, Stephen Holden described the record as \"a landmark, not only in the career of the 45-year-old singer, who has been recording since the late 1950s, but in the evolution of pop-soul music itself\".",
      "Tina Turner's 10 best songs and the stories behind them",
      "Tina Turner's journey from abuse to music superstardom",
      "How Tina Turner 'broke the silence' on domestic abuse",
      "Music legend Tina Turner dies at 83",
      "The album went on to sell more than 10 million copies, and earned three Grammys, including record of the year for What's Love Got To Do With It.",
      "Turner also performed the song on the live TV broadcast, wowing audiences with her vocals despite fighting a bad case of the flu.",
      "A support slot on Lionel Richie's US tour in 1984 reminded audiences of her ability to tear the roof off any venue she set foot in.",
      "By 1985, Turner was one of the world's biggest acts in an era of stadium superstars like Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince.",
      "The decision to withhold Hot For You, Baby from the original tracklist of Private Dancer makes sense. It sounds a little cheesy next to the sultry, sophisticated material that eventually populated the record.",
      "But fans will welcome the chance to hear Turner let rip, back in her prime, with a promise to \"love you all night long\".",
      "Mark Goodier, who is currently covering the Radio 2 breakfast show, said: \"To have something new to hear from Tina Turner is a treat for fans of all generations and a reminder of her unique talent.",
      "\"I'm lucky enough to have both interviewed Tina and seen her perform live. She was an outrageously good performer and at the same time a remarkable graceful lady, whose every note was shaped by her incredible life.\"",
      "As well as being released as a single, the track will feature on a new five-disc deluxe edition of Private Dancer, which is due for release in March.",
      "The collection will also feature B-sides, remixes and live tracks, as well as a film of Turner playing Birmingham's NEC Arena in March 1985, featuring guest appearances by David Bowie and Bryan Adams.",
      "Turner died in 2023 at the age of 83. No cause of death was given, but she was known to be struggling with a kidney disease, intestinal cancer and other illnesses."

      "Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 40, in December, accusing him of engaging in \"inappropriate and unwelcome behaviour\" and a smear campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation. He countersued last week, claiming she had made a \"duplicitous attempt to destroy\" him.",

      "Lively's lawyers said it showed him \"repeatedly leaning in toward Ms Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character\".",

      "Her legal documents said he wasn't speaking in character and that no sound was recorded.",
      "\"At one point, he leaned forward and slowly dragged his lips from her ear and down her neck as he said, 'it smells so good.'",
      "\"None of this was remotely in character, or based on any dialogue in the script, and nothing needed to be said because, again, there was no sound - Mr Baldoni was caressing Ms Lively with his mouth in a way that had nothing to do with their roles.",

      "When he tried to \"encourage her to take his direction, Baldoni offered up that he and his wife often just look into each other's eyes silently, to which she responded, 'Like sociopaths,' and laughed.\"",
      "Lively \"continued arguing\" and \"continued to break character\", which was \"extremely confusing for Baldoni\".",
      "He said Lively apologised for the smell of her spray tan and body make-up. \"Baldoni responded, 'It smells good,' and continued acting, slow dancing as he believed his character would with his partner, which requires some amount of physical touching.\"",
      "Lively joked about Baldoni's nose, and that he should get plastic surgery, he said.",
      "\"Any suggestion that this scene was filmed in any manner other than pure professionalism by Baldoni is unequivocally countered with actual evidence,\" his documents added.",
      "\"Her allegation of sexual harassment is a documented and knowingly fabricated lie.\"",
      "What does the video show?",
      "Lively and Baldoni, who was also the film's director, are slow dancing in a bar and their audio was recorded. After an initial exchange in which she questions whether they are in the correct position, they dance and smile silently.",
      "He kisses her forehead then goes to kiss her on the lips before she apparently hesitates and they continue dancing. She then seems to turn her head with their faces close together and he kisses her cheek.",
      "She tells him: \"I think we should be talking. I think it's more romantic if we're like... dancing and talking.\" He agrees and says \"the whole montage is us talking\".",
      "She continues: \"Cause it's like the moment they kiss, then you give them the thing that they want to see.\"",
      "He replies: \"That's why almost kissing is also good.\" She responds: \"Yeah. But we're still talking.\"",
      "They continue dancing affectionately, laughing and discussing the scene. He nuzzles her neck. She tells him talking is \"more romantic\".

      "He tells her \"I know you and Ryan [Reynolds, her husband] talk all the time\", but he and his wife Emily like to stare at each other, joking that \"you would find it terrifying\". She laughs and jokes that \"I'd be like, 'Oh no I found a sociopath'\".",
      "He asks the camera operator to film their lips \"super close\", to which she agrees but adds that they should \"start talking\" and \"don't give it [the kiss] to them\". He agrees they should \"keep restraint\".",

      "In the next take, he appears to kiss her neck then says \"Am I getting beard on you today?\" She laughs and responds: \"I'm probably getting spray tan on you.\" He nuzzles the other side of her neck and says: \"It smells good\". She adds: \"Well, it's not that, it's my body make-up\". They continue dancing and he shouts cut.",

      "But it was another show entirely which brought actor Alan Cumming back to his roots in Highland Perthshire, to begin a brand new chapter in his life - running Pitlochry festival theatre.",
      "\"I was filming an episode of Channel 4's All Aboard Scotland's Poshest trains, and we came to the theatre and spoke to Elizabeth Newman about the work they were doing and afterwards, she asked if I'd ever thought about running a theatre,\" he recalls.",

      "\"I have been living partly here for years and in recent years trying to split my time more evenly between Scotland and New York\", he says.",
      "\"I was very honest with the recruitment people about what I could offer. I have other things going on, but I can do a lot remotely.",
      "\"What really excited me was the theatre's mantra to \"share Pitlochry with the world and the world with Pitlochry\".",
      "\"I thought I can do that. I'm from here. I can go out into the world and bring the world back here.\"",
      "The news came as a huge surprise and Cumming insisted the announcement should be made ahead of the Emmy awards, for which he and the rest of the team involved with the Traitors won Outstanding Reality Competition Programme.",
      "Wrapped in his trademark tartan plaid, he was able to bring the world's attention to Pitlochry, something he hopes his appointment will continue to do.",
      "\"I know I have experience, I'm quite talented, and I know a lot of people but being well known is also important. This helps raise profile, and it'll help with fundraising.\"",
      "Like the appointment of Nicola Benedetti as director of the Edinburgh International Festival, it also gives the theatre, and the wider theatrical community a stronger voice when it comes to lobbying for support.",
      "Like Benedetti, he plans to appear on his own stage, as well as continuing with his own projects.",
      "His first season won't be announced until later this year, but he's already in discussions, and says he hopes to \"be in, or direct shows in every season\".",

      "\"It's exciting for me as I want to do things I like but also bring new people in. I'm kind of like the Pied Piper of Pitlochry.\"",
      "Having made the leap from Highland Perthshire to Broadway himself, he's confident he can do the same with the shows they create.",

      "\"I hoped they had fun and enjoyed the experience of being there but I also hope they think wasn't it amazing that we saw that show at Pitlochry and then it went to Broadway. And why not?\"",
      "His \"to do\" list since he started the job officially last week includes getting to know the staff and consulting with the community.",
      "He is keen the town and the wider community in Highland Perthshire make better use of the theatre \u2013 and not just for plays.",

      "A court in the Indian capital, Delhi, has ordered the seizure of two \"offensive\" paintings by MF Husain, one of India's most famous artists.",
      "The court on Monday granted permission for the police to seize the artworks after a complaint was filed alleging that the paintings, displayed at an art gallery and featuring two Hindu deities, \"hurt religious sentiments\".",
      "Husain, who died in 2011 aged 95, often faced backlash for the depictions of nude Hindu gods in his paintings.",
      "The Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), which hosted the exhibition, denied any wrongdoing and stated that a \"detailed\" police investigation found no \"cognisable offence\" by the gallery.",
      "The exhibition Husain: The Timeless Modernist at DAG showcased over 100 paintings from 26 October to 14 December.",
      "The complainant, Amita Sachdeva, a lawyer, said on X that on 4 December, she photographed the \"offensive paintings\" displayed at the DAG and, after researching previous complaints against the late artist, filed a police complaint five days later.",
      "On 10 December, Ms Sachdeva reported that she visited the gallery with the investigating officer, only to discover that the paintings had been removed. She claimed that the gallery officials asserted they had never exhibited the paintings.",
      "The paintings that Ms Sachdeva shared online depicted Hindu gods Ganesha and Hanuman alongside nude female figures. She also alleged that the Delhi police had failed to file a report.",
      "She later petitioned the court to preserve the CCTV footage from the gallery during the period when the paintings were reportedly on display, according to media reports.",
      "On Monday, a judge at Delhi's Patiala House Courts said that the police had accessed the footage and submitted their report. According to the inquiry, the exhibition was held in a private space and was intended solely to showcase the artist's original work, the judge added.",
      "The DAG said in a statement that it had been assisting police with their inquiries. It said the exhibition had attracted about 5,000 visitors and had received \"positive reviews in the press as well as from the public\".",
      "The complainant had been the only person to raise any objection to any of the artworks in the exhibition, the gallery said.",

      "Maqbool Fida Husain was one of India's biggest painters and was called \"Picasso of India\" but his art often stirred controversy in the country. His works have sold for millions of dollars.",
      "His career was marked by controversy when he was accused of obscenity and denounced by hardline Hindus for a painting of a nude goddess.",
      "In 2006, Husain publicly apologised for his painting, Mother India. It showed a nude woman kneeling on the ground creating the shape of the Indian map. He left the country the same year and lived in self-imposed exile in London until his death.",
      "In 2008, India's Supreme Court refused to launch criminal proceedings against  Husain, saying that his paintings were not obscene and nudity was common in Indian iconography and history.",
      "The court had then dismissed an appeal against a high court ruling that quashed criminal proceedings against Husain in the cities of Bhopal, Indore and Rajkot, condemning the rise of a \"new puritanism\" in India.",
      "The court also rejected calls for Husain, then in exile, to be summoned and asked to explain his paintings, which were accused of outraging religious sentiments and disturbing national integrity.",
      "\"There are so many such subjects, photographs and publications. Will you file cases against all of them? What about temple structures? Husain's work is art. If you don't want to see it, don't see it. There are so many such art forms in temple structures,\" the top court said.",
      "Many believe there is a rising tide of illiberalism against artistic expression in India.",
      "In October the Bombay High Court reprimanded the customs department for seizing artworks by renowned artists FN Souza and Akbar Padamsee on the grounds that they were \"obscene material.\"",

      "Kindness has been chosen as Children's Word of the Year for 2024 after a survey of thousands of young people.",

      "It follows 2023's winning phrase \"climate change\", and \"Queen\", which was the winner in 2022 following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "More than 3,000 children aged six to14 were asked for their suggestions, with the top three then put to vote by a further 2,000 children.",
      "Andrea Quincey, a director at OUP, said the choice was \"encouraging\" and reflected children's increasing awareness of mental health.",
      "She sad: \"We know from previous years that young people are very conscious of the big issues that can divide us as a society and attuned to the important role which language can play in bringing people together.",
      "\"It tells us that empathy and tolerance and the language we use matter, and that kindness is not only a solution to so many problems but is something everyone and anyone can do to make a difference.\"",
      "\"Slay\", \"sigma\" and \"skibidi\" were chosen as the top three slang words, which OUP said demonstrated the role of social media in influencing children's vocabulary.",
      "\"Slay\" as a slang term means to greatly impress or amuse, and \"sigma\" means popular or successful.",
      "Ms Quincey said the choice of these two words also reflected children's positivity in wanting to celebrate their friends.",
      "She added that in the final vote kindness had been chosen by 61% of children while a quarter chose \"artificial intelligence\".",

      "This Friday, he releases a second album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy Part 2, that explains what happened next.",
      "\"I've learned that love doesn't have to be this thing of high highs and low lows \u2013 fighting and pulling teeth just to stay together,\" he says.",
      "\"The first album was a lot of turmoil, and not too much closure. So I wanted to come back and say, 'Here's me on the other side of this, and I'm doing better'.",
      "\"I feel like, as a listener, I would want to hear that there's a way out.\"",
      "His new partner is also a singer-songwriter, Raiche Wright, who he met \"a couple of Thanksgivings ago\" when she came to one of his shows - and the new album dwells in a sort of bewildered bliss.",
      "\"Are you something from a dream or something that I made up?\" he wonders on the slick R&B groove of Are You Real.",
      "Later, on the acoustic guitar ballad If You Ever Change Your Mind, he croons, \"I love you, I love you,\" with a quiet sincerity rarely found in a pop record.",
      "Musically, the album paints from the same palette as before \u2013 a brand of 1960s soul where dusty piano grooves and chugging guitar lines are punched up with a modern pop sheen, and a pinch of rock and roll swagger.",
      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",
      "\"But it's okay to be happy in love with someone of a different colour, or a different size or shape, or the same sex, or whatever it is.",
      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",
      "As we speak, he's in rehearsals in Pennsylvania, ahead of his first European arena tour, which includes two nights at Wembley this March.",
      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",
      "He's going to be a mess - but Dimsdale insists it's a good thing.",
      "\"Every day I try to cry a little bit,\" he says. \"It's just pain leaving the body.",
      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",
      "\"He's the most beautiful, humble human being I've ever met. Second to only Jesus Christ.\"",
      "So, the obvious question: Is dad excited to become a grandfather?",
      "\"He's doing backflips,\" laughs the singer.",
      "\"I'm almost scared to have him as a granddad, because I want my kids to think I'm cool, too.\""

    "summary": "The settlement between the prince and the Sun's publisher is a dramatic, high stakes, turnaround.",
    "story": [
      "The settlement between Prince Harry and News Group Newspapers is a dramatic, high stakes, turnaround. But it's courtroom drama without the court.",
      "Prince Harry's team hailed the deal that stopped the trial as a \"monumental victory\", receiving an undisclosed amount of \"substantial damages\" and an \"unequivocal apology\".",
      "They say he's been vindicated - but will there also, deep down, be some mixed feelings about not getting his day in court? Was this really \"slaying dragons\" of the tabloid press, as he'd celebrated after a previous win when he'd given evidence in court against Mirror Group Newspapers?",
      "Co-claimant Lord Tom Watson paid tribute to Prince Harry's tenacity in pursuing this case for so long, praising his \"bravery and astonishing courage\".",
      "While on the opposing side of the scrapped case, NGN says the agreement \"draws a line under the past\" and they reject the claims that would have been made in court about a corporate cover-up.",
      "When NGN has spent \u00a31bn on previous claims, they might think any extra spent on staying out of court was a win for them too.",
      "Why did Prince Harry strike a deal now?",
      "It seems a change from Prince Harry being adamant that this was about \"accountability\".",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" Prince Harry told a media event in New York last month, about why he was taking on the Murdoch press.",
      "\"The scale of the cover up is so large that people need to see it for themselves,\" he said.",
      "He was fully aware of the financial risks built into such civil disputes, but seemed determined to press on, not just for himself but for 1,300 claimants who he said had settled but had \"no justice\".",
      "\"Accountability\" was mentioned again in a statement read out on behalf of Prince Harry and Lord Watson.",
      "\"The time for accountability has arrived,\" but it meant in terms of calling on Parliament and the police to pursue what they called the \"unlawful activity now finally admitted\" and \"the perjury and cover ups along the way\".",
      "There was a similar call for a follow-up when Prince Harry won against the Mirror group newspapers, but there has been no imminent sign of action.",
      "Perhaps it shouldn't have been a surprise that there was a deal.",
      "There has always been immense pressure for a settlement, because the curve of civil law bends so strongly in that direction.",
      "Even if a claimant wins a case, they could end up paying the costs of their opponents, if the damages award is less than they have been offered.",
      "The legal costs and damages at stake in this case could have been \u00a310m. That's a big poker hand decision for anyone. Plus the unknown jeopardy of what might happen in the court case and what questions Harry might have faced on the witness stand. He might have had his case ruled out of time or had his claims rejected.",
      "The psychological cards would all have been stacked towards doing a deal. Does everyone have a price? Even when they're seen as the last man standing?",
      "In terms of the amount of damages paid to Prince Harry, or what he might do with the money, that hasn't been made public.",
      "But what Prince Harry's team have seized upon is the skyscraper scale of the apology - seeing it as a \"collapse\" of the NGN's denials.",
      "They might argue that even if he had fought the court battle and won, there wouldn't be any more to be gained.",
      "This has always been a very personal battle for Prince Harry, the battle with the tabloids touching on his childhood as well as his adult life. So it's significant that the apology includes an admission of a \"serious intrusion\" into the \"private life of Diana, Princess of Wales\".",
      "That could mean more to him than any financial deal.",
      "Prince Harry's team also repeated the claim that \"the Sun, the flagship title for Rupert Murdoch's UK media empire, has indeed engaged in illegal practices\".",
      "This references the apology's mention of \"unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun\".",
      "NGN's statement emphasises that this applies to the activities of external private investigators, \"not by journalists\" on the Sun.",
      "But it narrows some of the fastidious distancing that there's been between what had happened at the shut down News of the World and the Sun.",
      "While the statement from Prince Harry's team lambasts those presiding over a \"toxic culture\" in parts of the media, past and present, and repeats its claim about a corporate cover-up, these are attack lines from a court case that will now never happen.",
      "NGN rejects the claims of a cover-up and the destruction of evidence. But the overall tone of the response is relief at the end of arguments over old battles, and that this now draws a line under all these disputes over front pages from decades ago.",
      "\"Indeed the judge made it clear in remarks in court at the end of the hearing that these cases are likely to be the last liable to go to trial,\" said NGN.",
      "The bombshell case that was going to see Prince Harry giving evidence against his tabloid tormentors is over before it began. Who, in the end, will be more pleased about that?",
      "Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?"

    "story": [
      "Chappell Roan can't be stopped.",
      "Over the last 12 months, the 26-year-old has become the buzziest star in pop. A flamboyant, flame-haired sensation, whose songs are as colourful as they are raw.",
      "Her debut album, released to little fanfare in 2023, has just topped the UK charts for a second time. Next week, she's up for six Grammy awards, including best new artist. And BBC Radio 1 have named her their Sound Of 2025.",
      "Success has been all the sweeter because her former record label refused to release many of the songs that exploded onto the charts last year.",

      "Reaching pop's A-list isn't just a vindication but a revolution.",
      "The 26-year-old is the first female pop star to achieve mainstream success as an openly queer person, rather than coming out as part of their post-fame narrative.",
      "On a more personal level, she's finally got the financial security to move into a house of her own, and acquire a rescue cat, named Cherub Lou.",
      "\"She's super tiny, her breath smells so bad, and she doesn't have a meow,\" the singer dotes.",
      "If kitten ownership is a benefit of fame, Roan has bristled at the downsides.",
      "She has spoken out against abusive fans, calling out \"creepy behaviour\" from people who harass her in airport queues and \"stalk\" her parents' home. Last September, she went viral for cussing a photographer who'd been shouting abuse at stars on the red carpet of the MTV Awards.",
      "\"I was looking around, and I was like, 'This is what people are OK with all the time? And I'm supposed to act normal? This is not normal. This is crazy',\" she recalls.",
      "The incident made headlines. British tabloids called her outburst the \"tantrum\" of a \"spoiled diva\".",
      "But Roan is unapologetic.",
      "\"I've been responding that way to disrespect my whole life - but now there are cameras on me, and I also happen to be a pop star, and those things don't match. It's like oil and water.\"",
      "Roan says musicians are trained to be obedient. Standing up for yourself is portrayed as whining or ingratitude, and rejecting convention comes at a cost.",
      "\"I think, actually, I'd be more successful if I was OK wearing a muzzle,\" she laughs.",
      "\"If I were to override more of my basic instincts, where my heart is going, 'Stop, stop, stop, you're not OK', I would be bigger.",
      "\"I would be way bigger... And I would still be on tour right now.\"",
      "Indeed, Roan rejected the pressure of extending her 2024 tour to protect her physical and mental health. She credits that resolve to her late grandfather.",
      "\"There's something he said that I think about in every move I make with my career. There are always options.\"",
      "\"So when someone says, 'Do this concert because you'll never get offered that much money ever again', it's like, who cares?",
      "\"If I don't feel like doing this right now, there are always options. There is not a scarcity of opportunity. I think about that all the time.\"",
      "As fans will know by now, Roan was born Kayleigh Rose Amstutz and raised in the Bible Belt town of Willard, Missouri.",
      "The oldest of four children, she aspired to be an actress \u2013 but, for a long time, it seemed her future would be in sport. She ran at state-competition level, and almost went to college for cross-country.",
      "Then she entered a singing contest at the age of 13 and won. Before long, she'd written her first song, about a crush on a Mormon boy who wasn't allowed to date outside his faith.",
      "She took her stage name as a tribute to her grandfather Dennis K Chappell and his favourite song, a Western ballad called The Strawberry Roan.",
      "\"He was very funny and very smart,\" she recalls. \"And I don't think he ever questioned my ability.",
      "\"A lot of people were like, 'You should go completely country', or, 'You should try Christian music'. And he never told me to do anything.",
      "\"He was the only person that was like, 'You don't need a plan B. Just do it'.\"",
      "Drag queen heaven",
      "Eventually, one of her compositions, a gothic ballad called Die Young, caught the attention of Atlantic Records, which signed her at the age of just 17.",
      "Moving to LA, she recorded and released her first EP, School Nights, in 2017. It was a solid but unremarkable affair, steeped in the sounds of Lana Del Rey and Lorde.",
      "Roan only found a sound of her own when a group of gay friends took her to a drag bar.",
      "\"I walked into that club in West Hollywood and it was like heaven,\" she told the BBC last year. \"It was amazing to see all these people who were happy and confident in their bodies.",
      "\"And the go-go dancers! I was enthralled. I couldn't stop watching them. I was like, 'I have to do that'.\"",
      "She didn't become a dancer, but she did write a song imagining what it would be like to be one and how her mother would react. Roan called it Pink Pony Club after a strip bar in her home town.",
      "\"That song changed everything,\" she says. \"It put me in a new category.",
      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",
      "\"Like I said before, there are always options.\"",

      "Balloonerism, released on Friday to generally positive reviews, follows the 2020 posthumous release of Circles, made of unfinished work completed after he died.",
      "Collaborators say the studio tracks first laid down more than 10 years ago used in the new album have barely been changed.",
      "Some of those who worked on the new release - who were present at the recording sessions - describe the finished product as haunting, raw, and unpolished.",
      "Circles was a big success but a mixed reception to recent posthumous albums from other artists has caused critics to question whether less is more when it comes to releasing music after death.",
      "Audio engineer Josh Berg was in the LA studio, known as the Sanctuary, where Mac wrote and recorded all his material between 2013-2014.",
      "\"I always hoped this day would come,\" he says of Ballonerism's final release.",

      "Mac Miller, real name Malcolm James McCormick, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and started making music at school.",
      "His debut album, Blue Slide Park, was the first independently released record to top the Billboard 200 chart in 16 years and all of his later albums followed the same path to the top five in the US.",
      "He wrote Balloonerism between labels in 2014 and producer Eric Dan, who worked with Mac since he was a teenager, tells Newsbeat he was \"just starting to come into his own\".",
      "\"That period was like a creative renaissance for him,\" he says. \"He was a creation machine.\"",
      "Josh says so many projects were started in that time but Balloonerism was among the ones that came closest to release, with Mac even getting to the stage of commissioning artwork.",
      "While Circles was \"in pretty rough shape\" when he died and finished off by producers, Eric says Balloonerism is largely untouched.",
      "\"We made a conscious decision to keep things as they were and not go back and 'fix' mistakes, tune things or add anything.",
      "\"The rough edges were part of its charm and highlighted where Mac was creatively at that time.\"",

    "summary": "We've rounded up all the key culture releases for the week ahead, from film to music.",
    "story": [
      "Worried about what's going to fill the gap once The Traitors ends on Friday? Fear not - the US version drops on Friday, with an all-star cast descending on the Scottish Highlands.",
      "But that's not the only thing to look forward to this week. Little Mix star Jade Thirlwall will be talking to Louis Theroux about new music, Harry Styles and more.",
      "Plus, The Brutalist is coming to UK cinemas, actress Naomi Watts is due to release a book, and FKA twigs's new album is out.",
      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Your next Traitors fix",
      "Hot on the heels of the UK final on Friday, the third season of The Traitors US is arriving on BBC iPlayer.",
      "Five episodes will be available to stream on Friday, after which there will be a new episode available every Friday.",
      "Unlike the UK series, the contestants on the US version are celebrities. The series two cast was primarily made up of US reality stars - with the additions of British Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu and former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.",
      "Players competing for the cash prize this time include Britney Spears' ex-husband Sam Asghari, former WWE wrestler Nikki Garcia and British aristocrat Lord Ivar Mountbatten.",
      "The show is filmed at the same castle as the UK version but in place of Claudia Winkleman, Scottish actor Alan Cumming presents. Don't worry, his outfits are just as fabulous.",
      "Jade Thirlwall talks new music... and Harry Styles",
      "Jade Thirlwall waited the longest of any member of Little Mix to release solo music, but she's given fans plenty to get stuck into recently.",
      "In July, she dropped debut single Angel of My Dreams, and she kicked off 2025 with a banger: a dance-pop track called It girl, which appears to take a swipe at the wider music industry.",
      "On Tuesday, she's appearing on Louis Theroux's podcast, which will be available on Spotify.",
      "I'm told it's going to be a \"candid\" conversation, in which Jade will discuss her early career and the X Factor era - including a date with Harry Styles.",
      "Other topics on the agenda include fellow bandmate Jesy Nelson's departure from Little Mix, her experience of an eating disorder, her boyfriend (Rizzle Kicks star Jordan Stephens, in case you haven't been following), and her new album.",
      "However good it is, it surely can't top her interview on podcast Sidetracked last year, in which she confessed she had a \"poo incident\" on stage with Little Mix. You can listen back to that on BBC Sounds.",
      "Is The Brutalist too long?",
      "The Brutalist has already won three prizes at the Golden Globes, and picked up nine Bafta film nominations.",
      "The film, which is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars, is released in UK cinemas this Friday.",
      "Starring Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones, it tells the tale of a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two.",
      "It's also really long: 215 minutes including a 15-minute intermission in the middle.",
      "I grew up watching Bollywood films, so a lengthy film doesn't spook me.",
      "But my colleague Lizo Mzimba asked director Brady Corbet for his take on the duration.",
      "\"I think that's something you can't concern yourself with. You have to do what's right for the project,\" he said.",
      "\"The length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting on a big canvas. I love small portraits and I love [German painter] Anselm Kiefer. For me, there's a space for both of them.",
      "\"And at the end of the day, especially if the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side so it's not so bad.\"",
      "Lizo's also interviewed the stars of the show - watch out for that later this week.",
      "Have you experienced Eusexua?",
      "FKA twigs coined the phrase Eusexua to describe a feeling of euphoria that is like transcending the human form.",
      "Just \"don't call it love\", she writes, in her song by the same name.",
      "Eusexua is also the title of her upcoming third studio album, due out on Friday.",
      "It's inspired by the techno rave scene in Prague, and is pronounced you-sex-you-uh, in case you were wondering.",
      "Ever since it was announced, there have been near-constant memes.",
      "But many have also expressed their thanks to the singer, that this word now exists.",
      "\u201cStill can't believe that the word Eusexua was literally never heard or used by a human before FKA twigs\u2026\u201d, wrote one X user.",
      "Naomi Watts dares to say it",
      "You probably know the actress Naomi Watts for films like King Kong and The Ring.",
      "But she also spends a lot of her time talking about the challenges she faced after experiencing early menopause.",
      "She was 36 when she started having symptoms she couldn't explain, only to learn that she was going through menopause.",
      "Now 56, she has written a book about her experiences and providing advice for other women.",
      "In Dare I Say It, she says she was initially wary about writing about menopause because she feared negative repercussions for her career.",
      "\u201cNo one in Hollywood was breathing a word about it. We were all behaving as if between the seductress years and the grandmother roles, women just\u2026 I don't know, vanished?\u201d she writes, in an excerpt of the book seen by BBC News.",
      "But she says she then decided to write it, after realising that there \"is nothing sexier than a woman who knows what she wants\".",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:44:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Harry Clark is among the former contestants who reveals some of the show's secrets to the BBC.",
    "story": [
      "The Traitors is one of the few things getting us through a miserable January. For three nights a week, it feels as if the whole country is living and breathing the cloaks-and-daggers drama.",
      "For the other four painstaking days when the show isn't on air, we're sharing our opinions and theories with everyone from colleagues to strangers online.",
      "But it's not just tactics and contestants viewers are talking about - my group chats are incessantly pinging with questions about what happens behind the scenes, where the cast go once they leave the castle, and whether Charlotte will ever reveal her real accent.",
      "Luckily, we no longer need to ponder most of these questions, as former contestants have been speaking to BBC News about the secret workings of the Traitors castle.",
      "What does a typical day in the castle look like, and what happens before breakfast?",
      "The order in which the contestants arrive at breakfast is a source of tension and speculation on the show.",
      "Series one faithful Maddy Smedley explains that contestants are kept in separate holding rooms when they come to the castle in the morning and are called to go into breakfast individually or as a group.",
      "Similarly, in the evenings, contestants wait in a holding room until a runner comes to individually escort them out of the building and into a car.",
      "Traitor and series two champion Harry Clark says there are no clocks in the castle and contestants have no sense of time.",
      "\"You get picked up in the morning and when filming is over, you get dropped back to the lodgings,\" he explains.",
      "\"I don't know what time the mission starts or when lunch is - we rely on the production team to direct us and in between, we all just sit around and chat.\"",
      "Unlike the hour-long episodes we see, Harry says the days aren't filled with wall-to-wall traitor speculation.",
      "\"I spent most the day talking to Paul about Liverpool and Chelsea or finding out if everyone believes in aliens and obviously that stuff doesn't make the final edit because it's not relevant to the game.\"",
      "Series one faithful Dr Amos Ogunkoya describes his days in the castle as \"a really nice holiday camp, until the roundtable\".",
      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, told the BBC last year there were cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He said a team of camera operators worked in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he said the cameras were hidden and some were built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explained.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton said the crew on location was made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he said.",
      "He explained that this team included everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who worked their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likened the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

    "summary": "Apple TV's hit dystopian workplace thriller finally returns after a three-year cliffhanger.",
    "story": [
      "Spoiler warning for season two's opening episode",
      "\"I don't think Mark, in the wildest reaches of his imagination, thought his company could do something as nefarious as faking a death,\" says actor Adam Scott of his character in Apple TV's Severance.",
      "But Mark's is an unusual workplace, to put it mildly.",
      "Employees at biotech conglomerate Lumon Industries are offered the company's pioneering severance programme, a concept inspired by series creator Dan Erickson's desire to escape the mind-numbing drudgery of his office jobs.",
      "Sold as the ultimate work-life balance, the firm's brain microchip procedure splits a person's consciousness and memory into dual existences.",
      "This means when \"severed\" grieving widower Mark Scout and his colleagues take the office lift each morning, their work-self - or \"innie\" - awakens for duty. Once they clock off, their \"outie\" re-emerges, returning to home life blissfully unaware.",
      "But series one's cliffhanger finale - the work of executive producer and director Ben Stiller - saw Mark discover his late wife Gemma may actually still be alive amid a rebellion by his team against their shadowy employers.",
      "The group managed to outsmart floor managers Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and override the severance system, briefly awakening their real-world bodies. Rebellious sceptic Helly (Britt Lowery) also learned a shattering truth about her outie's company ties.",
      "Fans have been waiting almost three years to find out what happens next, and on Friday, Severance returned to Apple TV for its anticipated second season.",
      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",
      "Tillman equally recognises Milchick's isolated experience as the sole black managerial figure. Steering clear of spoilers, he says we begin to understand Milchick's experience of being \"othered by the company he serves\".",
      "\"It really speaks to how some organisations and some corporations, in their attempt to be inclusive, miss the boat,\" he adds.",
      "Arquette continues: \"I feel every few years there's a new doctrine throughout the corporate space - some kind of PR switcharoo [about] how to be current and different than we were in the past.",
      "\"I think a lot of times things do need to change, but sometimes it doesn't really feel genuine.\"",

    "title": "Weight-loss drugs may boost health in many ways",
    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 16:01:04 GMT",
    "summary": "New weight-loss drugs have broad health benefits but also come with risks, researchers warn.",
    "story": [
      "The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an \"eye-opening\" impact on the body, researchers say.",
      "The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia.",
      "The US researchers also warned the drugs were \"not without risk\" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas.",
      "However, the results need very careful interpretation.",
      "Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together.",
      "\"This is new territory,\" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.",
      "Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses.",
      "There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs.",
      "They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures.",
      "Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease.",
      "There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever.",
      "On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy.",
      "'Definitely eye-opening'",
      "The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent.",
      "\"It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,\" Dr Aly told BBC News.",
      "The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious.",
      "Losing excess weight would in turn improve health. For example, lower levels of sleep apnoea \u2013 when breathing stops and starts while slumbering  \u2013 is thought to be down to losing weight around the tongue and throat, which can block the airways.",
      "But the drugs also appear to be directly altering the behaviour of cells and tissues in the body.",
      "Dr Aly said: \"Obesity is bad for the brain. Obesity is bad for mental health. Obesity is bad for the heart. Obesity could be the mother of all ills.\"",
      "Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide, in different doses, and mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1.",
      "Released by the gut after eating, GLP-1 travels through the blood and sticks to little receptors on the surface of brains cells.",
      "This tells the brain there is food in the stomach and is why people feel less hungry after eating.",
      "However, receptors that respond to GLP-1 are found throughout the body, including in the heart and some parts of the immune system.",
      "\"It is very clear this class of drugs seem to suppress reward mechanisms [in the brain so it] inhibits that urge to seek out alcohol, to seek out tobacco, to seek out gambling,\" Dr Aly said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower levels of inflammation, the alarm bell of the immune system, could have a wide range of health impacts.",
      "'Ozempic babies'",
      "The range of health benefits may strengthen the case for some people using the drugs, Dr Aly said.",
      "\"When you add more benefit, for the people who really are at risk of these conditions, that's an added plus,\" he said.",
      "But for those whose weight is not affecting their health, \"maybe the risk that they're buying themselves is actually much higher than the benefit\".",
      "However, the study has drawbacks that limit its findings.",
      "Most of the veterans were white men, so it did not include any female-specific effects, such as the anecdotal phenomenon of improved fertility and unexpected \"Ozempic babies\".",
      "And there could be reasons why some had been prescribed Ozempic or Weygovy, rather than other drugs, that could provide alternative explanations for some of the findings.",
      "Protective effect",
      "Thorough clinical trials have already proven benefits to heart health - and nausea is a known side-effect - but other findings will need to go through similar rigorous testing.",
      "Alzheimer's starts more than a decade before symptoms appear - but this study suggests just a few years on semaglutide has a protective effect.",
      "Trials are already under way to work out if this effect is real.",
      "\"Such trials will lead us much closer to the truth,\" Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said.",
      "\"Fortunately\u2026 several will report out in the next one to four years.\"",
      "And while \"interesting\", he said this latest study's findings were not strong enough to influence how the drugs were prescribed.",
      "Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said the study needed to be interpreted \"carefully\" but provided \"useful reassurance\" about the drugs' safety in people with diabetes.",
      "And further studies in other patients were \"awaited with interest\".",
      "The \"most surprising finding\" was the increase in joint pain, since weight loss should reduce pressure on the joints.",
      "But the fact some cells in the immune system had GLP-1 receptors meant the impact of these drugs was \"somewhat unpredictable\" and while some inflammatory disorders may be eased, \"others might conceivably be exacerbated\", Prof O'Rahilly said.",

      "Deprived children in England will \"pay the price\" of the government's changes to schools, Kemi Badenoch has said as she accused ministers of \"an act of vandalism\".",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, the Conservative leader argued that the government's Schools Bill would cut pay for teachers in academies, close down routes into teaching and block failing schools from automatically becoming academies.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said academies had been introduced by the previous Labour government and were \"here to stay\".",
      "He said it was a \"disgrace\" that Tory MPs opposed the bill, which also aims to protect vulnerable children, set up breakfast clubs and limit uniform costs.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is a wide-ranging bill which includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",

      "The original wording of the bill would have changed this but for the last few weeks Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has repeated the line \"there will be a floor, no ceiling\" on pay.",
      "On Tuesday evening, the government agreed to amend the wording in the bill. Instead, academies will have to have \"due regard\" to the national pay agreements.",

      "Badenoch told the Commons that the bill implies \"doctors are not sufficiently qualified to teach biology, that Olympic medallists can not teach PE\", and asked why the prime minister was closing routes into teaching.",
      "\"She knows that's not right,\" Sir Keir replied but added that it \"should not be extraordinary\" to suggest that teachers in schools should be qualified.",

      "\"It is an attack on excellence. It is an attack on higher standards. It is an attack on aspiration,\" she said.",
      "Sir Keir said his government was committed to academies and repeated his attack on Conservative MPs for voting against a bill which included \"vital protections for children\".",
      "\"The bill benefits children who need the nourishment of a breakfast club, the bill benefits the families that can't afford uniforms, the bill benefits the children who are currently out of school and nobody knows where they are, the bill benefits the children who could be taken out of school by abusers if this bill doesn't go through.\"",

      "The subject of academies is one where the Conservatives are united and keen to defend their record, with one shadow cabinet minister telling the BBC: \"It's one of the few clear success stories we have to tell.\"",
      "Academy schools were first introduced under Sir Tony Blair and enthusiastically expanded by the Conservatives when they came to power in 2010.",
      "So far only one Labour MP - Siobhain McDonagh - has publicly criticised the bill, however it is privately causing significant anxiety among Labour MPs, generally on the right of the party, who are proud of academies.",

      "\"Now, we need him to act decisively again,\" said Mr Ray-Hill.",
      "\"The new regulations we've all worked so hard to bring in threaten to leave gaping loopholes for criminals to exploit.",
      "\"The solutions are here, now. They aren't pie-in-the-sky solutions for the future. They exist, and they are trusted. Big tech just needs to be instructed to switch them on.\"",
      "In 2024, the IWF acted to remove images or videos of children suffering sexual abuse, or links to that content, on 291,270 webpages, which is the most child sexual abuse webpages ever discovered in its 29-year history.",
      "In 2014, the IWF began to proactively seek out and remove child sexual abuse imagery from the internet having been granted new powers by Sir Keir in his role as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "Before then, the IWF could only legally respond to reports made by the public, tech companies or the police.",
      "The powers granted by Sir Keir had a dramatic effect on the amount of child sexual abuse material the IWF was able to uncover, with 2024's figures showing an 830% increase on the 31,260 webpages found when proactive detection first started.",
      "'Blatant get-out clause'",

      "Ms Brown urged Sir Keir to remove a \"blatant get-out clause\" for tech companies, as well as to prevent illegal material  being shared in private communications.",
      "Ms Brown said Ofcom could create a situation where tech companies\u00a0will be in compliance with their duties if they stick to the letter rather than the spirit of its codes.",
      "She explained the duty for companies to remove illegal content only applies when it is \"technically feasible\", which will incentivise platforms to \"avoid finding ways to remove illegal content in order to evade compliance\".",
      "\"This undermines the Act's effectiveness in combatting online child sexual abuse,\" she said.",
      "\"We urge you to instruct Ofcom to urgently review and mitigate this blatant get-out clause.",
      "\"Additional legislation should be introduced to ensure there are no safe havens for criminals in private communications.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Child sexual exploitation and abuse is despicable and has a devastating impact on victims.",
      "\"UK law is clear - child sexual abuse is illegal and social media is no exception.",
      "\"Companies must ensure criminal activity cannot proliferate on their sites.\"",
      "They explained that from March, under the Online Safety Act, companies will need to take robust action to tackle child abuse material when they become aware of it, training moderating teams to spot child exploitation and testing whether their algorithms are promoting this material.",
      "\"If companies fail to act, Ofcom has robust enforcement powers including the ability to issue significant fines,\" they added.",
      "\"This government is committed to using all available levers, such as the Online Safety Act, to ensure children are protected online, and we will not hesitate to go further if necessary.\"",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said \"The law says that measures in our codes of practice must be technically feasible. However, we expect the vast majority of platforms will be able to take content down and we will hold them to account if they don't.",
      "\"If a platform claims something isn't technically feasible, we will investigate this and it will need to explain to Ofcom why that is. If we find it is technically feasible, it'll have to take content down.",
      "\"We've also been clear that we expect tech firms to invest in the development of new technologies to keep people safe.\""

      "Last year, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told a gathering of investors: \"We will make sure that every regulator in this country - especially our economic and competition regulators - takes growth as seriously as this room does.\"",
      "In a statement, Mr Bokkerink warned against competition authorities becoming \"vulnerable to short term expediency or vested interests\".",
      "He said that his approach at the CMA was designed to promote growth through fair and effective competition by ensuring consumers and businesses had choice and \"businesses large and small being free to compete, innovate and have a fair shot at succeeding based on merit...on a level playing field.\"",
      "The CMA's primary responsibility is to ensure consumers are well served by effective and fair competition.",
      "It was criticised by Microsoft's vice chair and president, Brad Smith, in 2023 after it initially blocked the tech giant's planned takeover of the gaming giant Activision Blizzard.",
      "At the time, he said the UK was \"bad for business\" and that confidence in the country had been \"severely shaken\".",
      "The CMA went on to approve the $69bn (\u00a356bn) deal, which was the biggest-ever takeover in the gaming industry, after Microsoft restructured its offer.",
      "Mr Smith later said the CMA was \"tough and fair\".",
      "Commenting on the change of chair, Ms Cardell said: \"The CMA has a critical role to play supporting the government's growth mission.\"",
      "She thanked Mr Bokkerink for \"his leadership and support over the last two years\".",
      "Mr Bokkerink was apppointed by former Conservative business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in the role which carries a five-year term.",

      "His interim replacement, Dr Gurr, worked at Amazon between 2011 and 2020, including two years as the online company's China president.",
      "He is currently the director of the Natural History Museum in London.",
      "Later this year, 11 people on the CMA's 33-member merger panel are due to step down.",
      "The panel - which is appointed by the Department for Business and Trade - is made up of independent experts who make decisions about whether large deals can proceed in the UK. They can serve for up to eight years."

    "story": [
      "The humble sandeel is set to take centre stage in the first courtroom trade battle between the UK and EU since Brexit.",
      "The UK has banned European vessels from catching the silvery fish species in its North Sea waters to protect marine wildlife that depend on it for food.",
      "But the EU is challenging the move, arguing it discriminates against Danish vessels that fish sandeel commercially, breaching the post-Brexit trade deal.",
      "The dispute is now heading for a three-day trade tribunal hearing, after formal talks to resolve the wrangle failed.",
      "Without a last-minute compromise, it will mark the first time the two sides have gone to arbitration under the 2021 trade agreement agreed by Boris Johnson.",
      "UK's puffin protection laws at centre of post Brexit row",
      "Challenge to fishing ban a threat to seabirds - RSPB",
      "The case is due to be heard from Tuesday next week at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a dispute resolution body based in the Hague, by a panel of three mutually-agreed international trade judges.",
      "They could uphold the UK's position - or order the UK to change or drop its ban, in which case Brussels could ultimately retaliate with tariffs on British exports if ministers refused to comply.",
      "Under the trade deal, a final ruling must be delivered by the end of April, although it could be issued earlier. There is no right to appeal.",
      "It comes as the UK prepares for tricky negotiations with the EU over new catch limits from June next year, when current arrangements under the trade deal run out.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer is also hoping to persuade EU leaders to strike new deals in areas such as security and food trade, as part of a wider \"reset\" in relations with the UK.",
      "Environmental plaudits",
      "Sandeel, a group of small eel-like fish species, is a jointly managed fish stock under the trade deal. It is not caught for culinary reasons and is unlikely to be found on restaurant menus in European capitals.",
      "But it is a favourite food of other fish species like cod and haddock, as well as threatened seabirds such as puffins and kittiwakes.",
      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",
      "But the dispute will be watched closely for how the judges balance the UK's right to take conservation measures with economic rights.",

      "The driving licence will also be able to be used for buy age-restricted items like alcohol. It is hoped they will also be able to be used for voting in elections and travelling on domestic flights.",
      "Furthermore, there will be a feature that could allow users to hide their address in certain situations where they want to, such as in a bars or a shop.",
      "The DVLA said that in 2024 there were over 52 million driving licences in Great Britain.",
      "Virtual licences are already in use in Australia, Denmark, Iceland and Norway.",
      "DSIT said it hopes many government services will be able to be offered as a digital alternative alongside paper or card versions by the end of 2027.",

      "Published21 January 2025",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy says some opposition members of the House of Lords are \"intent on wrecking\" the Football Governance Bill by having it delayed \"for years to come\".",
      "The legislation, which will establish the first independent regulator for the professional men's game in England, was reintroduced to Parliament by the government in October.",
      "It has just completed the first 'committee stage' in the Lords, where hundreds of potential amendments were tabled.",
      "The government is concerned that the legislation could be reclassified as a 'hybrid bill', which would require additional consultation with clubs.",
      "\"We really are at a critical juncture here,\" said Nandy, speaking at an event organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Football and the English Football League (EFL).",
      "\"We've had what is known as a 'wrecking amendment' put in front of the House of Lords in recent weeks to turn this bill into a hybrid bill, which would bury it in committee for years and years to come.",
      "\"And I do want to say to that handful of peers that have decided to take that approach, 'what you are doing is killing off the hopes and dreams and inheritance of fans who deserve far, far better'.\"",
      "A hybrid bill is one that is deemed to target specific private interests - such as football clubs. It must allow those affected to submit a petition to Parliament outlining their opposition, potentially adding to the time needed for it to pass into legislation.",

      "Background to Football Governance Bill",
      "The landmark legislation was tabled initially in March by the previous Conservative government, but failed to pass through Parliament before the general election was called in May.",
      "The reintroduced version will give the regulator powers to assess the impact of the Premier League's controversial 'parachute payments' to relegated clubs as part of a 'State of the Game' review every five years.",
      "Its findings could influence which proposed sharing model the regulator may then impose - the Premier League's or the EFL's - if it is asked to decide how much money the top flight should redistribute to the football pyramid via 'backstop powers'.",
      "It will also \"explicitly require clubs to provide effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices and any proposals to relocate home grounds.",
      "However, while supporter groups and the EFL are among those to have welcomed the bill, the Premier League is concerned at the regulator having \"unprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of [its] revenues\", and also said it could have \"a negative impact\" on competitiveness and investment.",
      "The legislation has also faced opposition from peers such as West Ham United vice chair Baroness Brady, who told the Lords that there are \"dangers lurking in this bill\".",
      "Other members of the Lords have expressed concerns over the potential cost to smaller clubs, although the government said there was no intention to \"impose unnecessary, onerous and burdensome requirements\" on clubs, which was \"in no-one's interest\".",
      "'Hard but important message'",
      "Last month Nandy told MPs it was \"high time we got on with it\" when asked about the scrutiny the legislation had faced in the House of Lords. She has now delivered what she called \"a hard but important message\".",
      "\"It was a Labour opposition and the Conservative government that put the commitment to continue with these reforms into our manifestos, and it was the British people who voted for them,\" she said.",
      "\"And my message to those handful of Conservative peers is: 'We will not rest until we make good on that promise to fans'.",
      "\"This is what people voted for - this is nothing less than fans deserve, and we are a government that will leave no stone unturned to deliver on that promise. Change for fans has been long overdue, that change is coming, and nobody will stand in its way.\"",
      "The bill will now pass to the 'report stage' of its journey through the House of Lords before it passes to the Commons. The government hopes it will come into law later this year.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump will want to do a good deal with the UK, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones has insisted.",
      "Jones, the chancellor's second-in-command, said he was confident UK-US trading relationships could be deepened and that Peter Mandelson will be \"brilliant\" as the new UK ambassador to the US.",
      "However, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has claimed Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer is in a \"weak\" negotiating position due to his wish to strengthen ties with the EU at the same time as with the US.",
      "The PM has insisted he can walk a tightrope and balance strong trading and security relationships on both sides, despite Trump's dislike of the EU.",
      "But some nervousness seems apparent, with Lord Mandelson, launching a charm offensive ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, lauding his \"straight talking and deal-making instincts\" and talking up a new \"Atlantic alliance\".",
      "Mandelson praises Trump ahead of inauguration",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "IMF warns on Trump's plans but upgrades UK outlook",
      "Jones said the government was optimistic about the chances of a good relationship with the incoming administration, highlighting \"opportunities for us to seize\" around a potential post-Brexit trade deal, which he suggested could include technology.",
      "\"Donald Trump is well-known for wanting to do a good deal - I think there are plenty of good deals for us to do together,\" he said.",
      "\"There are definitely opportunities to deepen our trading relationships, not least in technology, science and research... and I think that's something that could be a positive outcome.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the Treasury minister suggested the UK could dodge Trump's pledge for a 20% tax on all imports into the US due to not being in a \"trade deficit\", adding ministers have \"prepared for all scenarios\".",
      "Jones also expressed confidence Lord Mandelson will \"form a very strong partnership with the new administration\", despite some reports that the incoming president may reject him - and a top Trump adviser dismissing him as an \"absolute moron\".",
      "The appointment of Lord Mandelson, who is best-known as a New Labour spin doctor and minister under Tony Blair, is the first time in 50 years that a PM has selected a politician rather than a diplomat for the role, which Jones said was \"because we want to do things differently\".",
      "Asked about the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning of \"resurgent fascism\" ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jones strongly disagreed, insisting the UK government respected Trump's democratic mandate, adding: \"I speak on behalf of the government and we don't agree with it\".",
      "A much less rosy view of the \"special relationship\" was painted by Farage, a long-time supporter of Trump, whose offer of acting as a go-between in negotiations with the president-elect has so far been rejected by the government.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, the Reform UK leader said the government needs to \"think outside the box\" when dealing with the Trump administration, and that all evidence - including Lord Mandelson's appointment - suggests they are not doing that.",
      "\"I think what this government does, is what all governments do - they stick with the established, status quo methods of appointing people,\" he said.",
      "Farage said he feared the UK would squander \"an amazing opportunity\" to get away from tariffs and negotiate free trade deals due to the prime minister's refusal to choose the US over the EU.",
      "\"This guy [Trump] does business differently to anybody else we've seen in global politics before,\" he said. \"They don't think they need me - but they might find in short order that maybe they do.",
      "\"If we have a deteriorating relationship with America that does hurt us financially, it'll be the Labour government's fault,\" adding that Trump is \"probably more Eurosceptic\" than he is.",
      "'Blind faith'",
      "The fact the UK still does not have a free trade deal with the US, despite this being a priority in Boris Johnson's Conservative manifesto in 2019, has been criticised by the party's current leader Kemi Badenoch, who said leaving the EU without a growth plan was  \"a mistake\".",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, a prominent voice in the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, was questioned about Badenoch's comments by Kuenssberg after she urged swift action to agree a UK-US trade deal.",
      "Patel, who was Johnson's home secretary, said there had been plans to legislate around starting the Brexit process - but she acknowledged a lack of plans for what to do afterwards to rebuild economic relationships.",
      "She said: \"In terms of long-term sustainable proposals Kemi's right to recognise that clearly wider plans needed to be put in place.\"",
      "Responding to Patel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller claimed the Conservatives were now competing with Reform UK to be \"the most submissive with Trump\" - but the UK should not put \"blind faith\" in the new administration.",
      "He said: \"[Priti Patel's] desire to rush into a free trade deal between the UK and US - one that could sell British farmers and food standards down the river - reminds us of where her and her party's true alliances lie: with the Mar-a-Lago clan, not with constituents here in Britain.\""

    "story": [
      "The Conservatives have called for the forthcoming public inquiry into the Southport murders to consider why the police, prosecutors and government did not make public more details about the killer before his trial.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have both said the government could not have risked Axel Rudakubana walking free by ignoring advice that publishing information could have jeopardised his trial.",
      "But Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was likely an \"information vacuum\" had resulted in misinformation which \"fuelled\" the riots which followed the attack.",
      "He asked why the discovery of ricin and a copy of an al-Qaeda training manual in Rudakubana's house could not have been swiftly revealed.",
      "Cooper said the government had wanted to make public that Rudakubana had been referred to the counter-extremism programme Prevent, but could not because of legal advice.",
      "Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder on 31 July, shortly after launching his attack which killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.",
      "Within days, in early August, officers searching Rudakubana's home found ricin and a file entitled \"Military Studies in the Jihad against the Tyrants, the al-Qaeda training manual\".",
      "The government was kept up-to-date about the discovery. The BBC has been told the ricin was in a Tupperware box in his bedroom.",
      "Police rarely give details of an ongoing investigation without what they describe as a \"policing purpose\".",
      "In this case, false rumours were spreading online about the killer, including that he had migrated to Britain.",
      "Senior officers felt under pressure to reassure the public, and dispel some of the rumours about the suspect by making clear he was in fact British.",
      "But after discovering the ricin and manual they did not immediately make this public.",
      "The investigation continued, with searches taking weeks because of the need for teams to wear hazmat suits and take a break every 40 minutes.",
      "As they prepared to announce the outcome to the investigation, senior police officers became frustrated that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was advising them to withhold many details they felt should be made public, due to false claims online.",
      "The killer was not charged with production of a biological weapon, and possession of information likely to be useful for terrorism, until 29 October 2024.",
      "Southport killer admitted carrying a knife more than 10 times",
      "'Terrorism has changed', says PM on Southport attacks",
      "Father stopped Southport killer from going to former school a week before attack",
      "Sources close to the handling of the case say police wanted to announce these charges and reveal the discovery of the ricin and manual 11 days earlier, on 18 October, but there was a hold-up as the CPS and the police negotiated over what could be said publicly.",
      "A source said the CPS \"put a load of red pen through the statement\".",
      "Rudakubana was finally charged with the additional two offences on 29 October.",
      "It was at this point, three months after the Southport attacks, that police made public for the first time that the ricin and manual had been found.",
      "He was not charged with preparing for acts of terrorism because, under current laws, this would involve finding evidence of a political motivation or ideology, and none had been found.",
      "The prime minister suggested on Tuesday the laws defining terrorism might need to change to take account of \"loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom\".",
      "Neil Basu, former counterterrorism chief at the Metropolitan Police, told Radio 4's Today programme that he thought doing so would be a mistake.",
      "\"Bad legislation is made in haste in response to shocking incidents,\" he said. \"We need to think very carefully about the unintended consequences.\"",
      "Mr Basu said the people the prime minister pointed to were not terrorists but rather \"violent individuals\" who use \"any ideology as an excuse for their violent actions\". As such, some would \"revel\" in being branded a terrorist.",
      "Adding to the workload of counter-terror teams would also \"come with a very large bill\", Mr Basu said.",
      "Lord Carlile, who previously served as the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, agreed with Sir Keir that it was \"high time\" to review the definition of terrorism in UK law to include lone attackers who do not have a clear motivation.",
      "He told BBC Breakfast that he thought Rudakubana being a British citizen should have been made public far quicker, as claims about him being a migrant helped fuel the riots.",
      "But he said regarding the other details that it was \"not for the prime minister, or for retired police officers, or for the police, or for the newspapers to prejudice a trial by disclosing material that could undermine the integrity of that trial\".",
      "Rudakubana has now pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced and will be sentenced on Thursday.",
      "Normally the risk of jeopardising the case falls away once all charges have been decided, either by a plea, or a jury reaching a verdict.",
      "Crime reporters attended a police and CPS-led briefing setting out the entire case - but on Monday, the CPS again decided the information should not be published, this time until after the sentencing.",

      "Yet the CPS insists it needs to protect the sentencing process due to take place on Thursday.",
      "Nick Price, CPS director of legal services, said: \"The next stage of the process is for the prosecution to present our full case to the court on Thursday - including relevant details of the defendant's past - so the judge can consider all the evidence when passing sentence.",
      "\"This will be the point when the full details of this case will be heard by the public.",
      "\"We recognise the profound interest in these proceedings, and it is important the prosecution case is presented to the court so the facts can be determined which may inform the sentence handed down.\"",
      "The CPS has taken this position because it believes the judge is entitled to make factual findings about the case and must also determine what weight to attach to different aspects of the evidence.",
      "However, the Crime Reporters Association, representing around 50 senior crime and home affairs correspondents, has written to the CPS raising concerns that the service is breaching a long-established principle that there is no legal risk in publishing material about a case after guilty pleas and before sentencing.",
      "The CPS said in its response that the \"independence of the judge must be respected\"."

      "Yet once in Parliament Siddiq told journalists that she had \"no capability or desire to influence politics in Bangladesh\".",
      "So these links weren't a secret, but perhaps they weren't viewed as a bad thing within Labour, not least since it has shown little sign of distancing itself from the Awami League in recent years.",

      "This included in 2022 when the then-Bangladeshi PM was in London for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, a meeting that Bin Quasem calls \"heartbreaking and shocking\".",
      "A Starmer ally argues it is \"perfectly legitimate\" for him to have met Hasina, and it did not amount to an endorsement of her policies.",
      "The apparent attempts by Labour over the years to keep Bangladesh on side might reflect the political reality here in the UK, especially in parts of the capital city.",
      "\"You can't succeed in east London without understanding the Bangladeshi vote\", one seasoned Labour campaigner explains.",
      "However, those who fail to appreciate the country's divided and volatile politics can end up offending those they are attempting to charm. \"You need to carefully balance what you say and do,\" the campaigner says. \"If you are too overt for one [Bangladeshi] party, you'll get criticised.\"",
      "Analysis by the FT suggests there are at least 17 UK constituencies where the voting-age Bangladeshi population is larger than the Labour majority.",
      "Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency has at least 6,000 adult residents of Bangladeshi origin.",
      "A potential blind spot",
      "Might this mix of warmth and political pragmatism have clouded Starmer's judgement from a potential corruption storm on the horizon when, shortly after winning the election in July, he appointed Siddiq as the Treasury minister responsible for leading Britain's anti-corruption efforts?",
      "\"Starmer has blindspots for his friends and political allies,\" says a Labour source. \"It's not new.\"",
      "Investigative journalist David Bergman, who has been shedding light on Siddiq's connections to Bangladeshi politics for a decade, points out context is everything. \"This was not a major story until Labour got into power, Tulip Siddiq became a minister and the Awami League government fell,\" he says.",

      "\"Then there was a blind spot about how tied she was to the UK Awami League.\"",
      "When I put this to one Labour MP, they responded that the UK media, as well as Labour, have had a Bangladesh blind spot.",
      "\"There are some 600,000 people in the British Bangla diaspora\", they say. \"It is a country with the eighth largest population on Earth yet we've not heard a peep [from the UK media] since the events of 5 August.\"",
      "The corruption investigations into Hasina are likely to rumble on for some time, potentially bringing further issues for Starmer's top team to address in the months ahead while Siddiq remains a Labour MP.",

      "To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "Why does the government borrow money?",
      "The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers pay income tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits.",
      "It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens.",
      "But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing.",
      "Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.",

      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "The government sells short and long-term gilts to allow it to borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates.",
      "How much is the UK government borrowing?",
      "The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month.",
      "For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go.",
      "So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.",
      "In the last full financial year, to March 2024, the government borrowed \u00a3125.1bn.",
      "The most recent monthly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the government borrowed \u00a317.8bn in December 2024 - \u00a310.1bn more than in December 2023, and the highest level for the month for four years.",

      "The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about \u00a32.8 trillion - or \u00a32,800,000,000,000.",
      "That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.",

      "But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies.",
      "How much money does the government pay in interest?",
      "The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays.",
      "That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021.",
      "The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month.",
      "It was \u00a38.3bn in December 2024. This was \u00a33.8bn more than in December 2023, and is the third-highest December figure since monthly records began in January 1997.",

      "The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government was \"on course\" to miss its own borrowing targets.",

      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",
      "\"It's a magic moment for the life of Pompeii, and this excavation work offers us the possibility to share this with the public.\"",

      "The new company, called The Stargate Project, was announced at the White House by President Donald Trump who billed it \"the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\" and said it would help keep \"the future of technology\" in the US.",
      "But Elon Musk - both a top adviser to Trump and rival to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman - on Wednesday said the venture does not \"actually have the money\" it has pledged to invest.",
      "Investment in AI is currently exploding, driving demand for new data centres while also raising concerns about the huge amounts of water and power the facilities require.",
      "The venture is a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, Japan's Softbank - led by Masayoshi Son - and MGX, a tech investment arm of the United Arab Emirates government.",
      "The companies said the new venture, which was in the works before Trump took office, had $100bn in funding available immediately, with the rest to come over four years, creating an estimated 100,000 jobs.",
      "Commenting on a post on X where OpenAI detailed the plans, Musk, who owns the platform, wrote \"They don't actually have the money.\"",
      "\"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority,\" he added.",
      "Musk, however, did not provide any details or substantiation for how he had arrived at the much smaller amount.",
      "Altman then replied: \"Wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "\"Want to come visit the first site already under way?\" Altman added. \"This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you'll mostly put US first.\"",

      "A source close to Stargate said it was not clear where Musk had gotten his information and that the company was well-positioned to deploy $100 bn.",

      "\"We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr President,\" he added, even though the project was underway before Trump won November's election.",

      "For developers to meet that demand, the consultancy estimated that at least twice the capacity would have to be built by 2030 as has been constructed since 2000.",
      "But analysts have warned that the process is likely to be bogged down by issues such as power and land constraints and permitting.",

      "Along with Musk's scepticism about funding for the specific project, there are growing concerns generally about the data centres taxing energy supplies and questions about the role of foreign investors.",

      "It is unclear what legal authority Trump will have to delay the implementation of a law that is already in effect. But it expected that his government will not enforce the ban if he issues an executive order.",
      "It's an about-face from his previous position. Trump had backed a TikTok ban, but has more recently professed a \"warm spot\" for the app, touting the billions of views he says his videos attracted on the platform during last year's presidential campaign.",

But, he said, it's not clear whether those conditions have been met.",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is work with Congress, and not potentially be in violation of the law or have any questions left hanging,\" he said.",

      "A new, fast-moving wildfire has erupted in Los Angeles County, prompting tens of thousands of people to evacuate a region already reeling from the most destructive fires in its history.",
      "The Hughes fire ignited 45 miles (72km) north-west of the city of Los Angeles on Wednesday morning, near Castaic Lake in a mountainous area that borders several residential areas and schools.",
      "It grew to more than 10,000 acres in several hours on Wednesday, fuelled by winds and dry brush. No homes or businesses have been damaged, and officials expressed confidence about getting it under control.",

      "Orange flames lined the mountains as aircraft dropped water and flame retardant.",
      "The region is once again under a red flag warning, continuing through Thursday. This cautions of a high fire risk due to strong winds and dry, low-humid conditions.",
      "Winds in the area were blowing at about 20-30mph (32-48km/h), but could pick up, which would fan the blaze and make it harder for air crews to operate.",
      "Climate change has made the grasses and shrubs that are fuelling the Los Angeles fires more vulnerable to burning, scientists have said.",

      "The fire continued to grow as the sun set on Wednesday, but Los Angeles County fire chief Anthony Marrone said he believed crews were making progress.",
      "\"The situation remains dynamic and the fire remains a difficult fire to contain, although we are getting the upper hand,\" he said. The fire was declared 14% contained early on Thursday, according to the website of Cal Fire, California's statewide fire agency.",
      "A fire being 100% contained does not mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped.",
      "Officials said the blaze was different from the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed at least 28 people and decimated more than 10,000 homes and businesses earlier this month.",
      "Chief Marrone said they were benefiting from lower winds - unlike the 70-90mph winds seen during the previous fires - and having so many helicopters and planes able to fight the blaze from above.",

      "But \"if it jumps the lake, it becomes a much more dynamic situation\", he said.",
      "One woman who fled her home told NBC 4 that she was stuck on Interstate 5, California's primary transportation highway that runs through the state. Parts of the interstate in the area had been closed because of the fire.",

      "Have you been evacuated due to the fires? Get in touch if it is safe to do so.",
      "Two other fires ignited Wednesday further south, near San Diego and Oceanside. The Lilac fire was declared fully contained after burning 85 acres. Like the separate Center fire, which has covered four acres, it burned in populated areas. Evacuation orders have now been mostly lifted.",

      "\"We don't have a fire season in California. We have a fire year,\" she said. \"We've had wildfires in January before, but it's\u00a0exacerbated by the Santa Ana winds. The wind is a huge factor when we've had such a dry year.\"",

      "The deaths occurred between 7 December and 19 January and the victims were members of three related families. Six of the children who died were siblings, with ages ranging from seven to 15 years. Their houses have been sealed.",
      "Though doctors have ruled out the possibility of an infection, an administrative order says that people identified as close contacts of the three families are being moved to a government hospital in Rajouri, where their condition will be monitored.

      "From September, those seeking to summit the world's tallest mountain during peak season will have to pay $15,000 (\u00a312,180), a 36% rise on the longstanding fee of $11,000, officials said on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "LGBT couples now have the same rights as any other couple - the culmination of a decades-long campaign.",
    "story": [
      "When Thailand's long-awaited equal marriage law came into effect on Thursday,  police officer Pisit \"Kew\" Sirihirunchai hoped to be among the first in line to marry  his long-term partner Chanatip \"Jane\" Sirihirunchai.",
      "And he was - they were the sixth couple to register their union at one of Bangkok's  grandest shopping malls, in an event city officials helped organise to celebrate this legal milestone.",
      "Hundreds of couples across Thailand received marriage certificates on Thursday, breaking into smiles or tearing up over the moment they had dreamed of for so long.",
      "It was a pageant of colours and costumes as district officials hosted parties with photo booths and free cup cakes - one Bangkok district was giving air tickets to the first couple who registered their marriage there.",
      "\"The rainbow flag is flying high over Thailand,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wrote on Facebook from Davos where she is attending the World Economic Forum.",
      "Activists said they were hoping to cross the 1,448-mark for registrations by the end of Thursday - 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage.",
      "\"We have been ready for such a long time,\" Pisit said. \"We have just been waiting for the law to catch up and support us.\"",
      "The two men have been together for seven years. Eager to formalise their relationship, they had previously been to a Buddhist monk to give them an auspicious new last name they can share \u2013 Sirihirunchai. They had also asked local officials to issue a letter of intent, which they both signed, pledging to get married.",
      "But they said having their partnership recognised under Thai law is what they had been waiting for: \"This is perfect for us. The law that protects our rights.\"",
      "'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples",
      "Until now, official documents listed Pisit and Chanatip as brothers. That way they could be a family in the eyes of the law. A marriage certificate means LGBTQ+ couples now have the same rights as any other couple to get engaged and married, to manage their assets, to inherit and to adopt children.",
      "They can also make decisions about medical treatment if their partner becomes ill and incapacitated, or extend financial benefits \u2013 such as Pisit's government pension \u2013 to their spouse.",
      "\"We want to build a future together \u2013 build a house, start a small business together, maybe a caf\u00e9,\" he adds, making a list of all that the law has enabled. \"We want to build our future together and to take care of each other.\"",
      "The law, which passed in both houses of parliament in June last year before being endorsed by the Thai king in September, is a big step for LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Thailand remains an outlier in Asia in recognising marriage equality - only Nepal and Taiwan have legalised same-sex unions.",
      "It's one reason why Aki Uryu, who is Japanese, moved to Bangkok to be with her partner. She said life is difficult for the LGBTQ+ community back home: \"In Thailand, I can hold hands with my partner, walk together. No one says anything. It's just different. It feels right.\"",
      "After the two women married on Thursday, Aki said: \"It is like I have started my new life.\"",
      "Watching them celebrate, along with so many other couples in a Bangkok mall, was Mr Zhang, a gay Chinese man who did not want to reveal his first name.",
      "\"We're excited, we're also very jealous,\" he said. \"Thailand is so close to China, but in another sense it's so far away.\"",
      "And yet, even in Thailand, with its famed tolerance towards LGBTQ+ people, activists say it took a sustained campaign to win legal recognition.",
      "A long wait",
      "\"We've been waiting for this day for 18 years - the day everyone can recognise us openly, when we no longer need to be evasive or hide,\" 59-year-old Rungtiwa Thangkanopast, who will marry her partner of 18 years in May, told the BBC earlier this week.",
      "She had been in a marriage, arranged by her family, to a gay man, who later died. She had a daughter, through IVF, but after her husband's death began spending time, and later helping run, one of the first lesbian pubs in Bangkok. Then she met Phanlavee, who's now 45 and goes by her first name only.",
      "On Valentine's Day 2013 the two women went to the Bang Rak district office in central Bangkok to ask to be officially married - a popular place for marriage registration because the name in Thai means \"Love Town\".",
      "This was the time when LGBTQ+ couples began challenging the official view of marriage as an exclusively heterosexual partnership by attempting to get marriage certificates at district offices.",
      "There were around 400 heterosexual couples waiting with them on that day. Rungtiwa and Phanlavee were refused, and the Thai media mocked their effort, using derogatory slang for lesbians.",
      "Still, activists managed to persuade the government to consider changing the marriage laws. A proposed civil partnership bill was put before parliament, offering some official recognition to same-sex couples, but not the same legal rights as heterosexual couples.",
      "A military coup in 2014 which deposed the elected government interrupted the movement. It would be another decade before full marriage equality was approved by parliament, in part because of the rise of young, progressive political parties that championed the cause.",
      "Their message resonated with Thais \u2013 and attitudes too had changed. By this time, same-sex marriage was legalised in many Western countries and same-sex love had become normalised in Thai culture too.",
      "Such was the shift in favour of the law that it was passed last year by a thumping majority of 400 votes to just 10 against. Even in the notoriously conservative senate only four opposed the law.",
      "And couples like Rungtiwa and Phanleeva now have their chance to have their love for each other recognised, without the risk of public derision.",
      "\"With this law comes the legitimacy of our family,\" Rungtiwa says, \"We're no longer viewed as weirdos just because our daughter isn't being raised by heterosexual parents.\"",
      "The new law takes out gender-specific terms like man, woman, husband and wife from 70 sections of the Thai Civil Code covering marriage, and replaces them with neutral terms like individual and spouse.",
      "However, there are still dozens of laws in the Thai legal code which have not yet been made gender-neutral, and there are still obstacles in the way of same-sex couples using surrogacy to have a family.",
      "Parents are still defined under Thai law as a mother and a father. The law also does not yet allow people to use their preferred gender on official documents; they are still stuck with their birth gender. These are areas where activists say they will still need to keep pushing for change.",
      "And it is especially significant for older couples, who have had to ride out the shifts in attitude.",
      "\"I really hope people will put away the old, stereotypical ideas that gay men cannot have true love,\" said Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira.",
      "He and his partner Prinn, both in their 40s, have been together for 24 years.",
      "\"The two of us have proved that we genuinely love each other through thick and thin for more than 20 years,\" Chakkrit said. \"We have been ready to take care of each other since our first day together. We are no different from heterosexual couples.\"",
      "While Chakkrit's parents quickly accepted their partnership, it took Prinn's parents seven years before they could do so.",
      "The couple also wanted to share the production business they ran together, and other assets, as a couple, so they asked Prinn's parents to adopt Chakkrit officially, giving him the same family name. Prinn says the new law has brought welcome legal clarity to them.",
      "\"For example, right now when a same sex couple buy something together \u2013 a large item - they cannot share ownership of it,\" said Prinn. \"And one of us passes away, what both have us have earned together cannot be passed on to the other. That's why marriage equality is very significant.\"",
      "Today, said Prinn, both sets of parents treat them as they would just like any other married children.",
      "And when they had relationship problems like any other couple, their parents helped them.",
      "\"My dad even started reading gay magazines to understand me better. It was quite cute to see that.\"",

      "\"We went to our land to harvest some olives,\" Ayghad explains. \"We went in two separate cars. My father took a different route back to our home in the city of Idlib. I warned him against it, but he insisted. His car hit a landmine and exploded.\"",
      "Ayghad's father died instantly at the scene. Not only did he lose his dad that day, but he also lost his family's main source of income. Their farmland, spread across 100,000 square metres, was filled with 50-year-old olive trees. It's now been designated a dangerous minefield.",
      "At least 144 people, including 27 children, have been killed by landmines and unexploded remnants of war since Bashar al-Assad's regime fell in early December, according to the Halo Trust, an international organisation specialising in clearing landmines and other explosive devices.",
      "The Syria Civil Defence - known as the White Helmets - told the BBC that many of those killed were farmers and landowners who were trying to go back to their land after the Assad regime collapsed.",
      "Unexploded remnants of war pose a grave threat to life in Syria. They're mainly split into two categories. The first are unexploded ordnances (UXOs) like cluster bombs, mortars and grenades.",
      "Hassan Talfah, who heads the White Helmets team clearing UXOs in north-western Syria, explains that these devices are less challenging to clear because they are usually visible above ground.",
      "The White Helmets say that, between 27 November and 3 January, they cleared some 822 UXOs in north-western Syria.",
      "The bigger challenge, Mr Talfah says, lies in the second category of munition \u2013 landmines. He explains that former government forces planted hundreds of thousands of them across various areas in Syria - mainly on farmland.",
      "Most of the deaths recorded since the Assad regime fell happened on former battle front lines, according to the White Helmets. Most of those killed were men.",
      "Mr Talfah took us to two huge fields riddled with landmines. Our car followed his on a long, narrow and winding dirt road. It's the only safe route to reach the fields.",
      "Along the sides of the road, children run around the area. Hassan tells us they are from families who have recently returned. But the dangers of mines surround them.",
      "As we get out of the car, he points to a barrier in the distance.",
      "\"This was the last point separating areas under the control of government forces from those held by opposition groups\" in Idlib province, he tells us.",
      "He adds that Assad forces planted thousands of mines in the fields beyond the barrier, to stop rebel forces from advancing.",
      "The fields around where we stand were once vital farmlands. Today, they are all barren, with no greenery visible except for the green tops of land mines that we can see using binoculars.",
      "With no expertise in clearing land mines, all the White Helmets can do for now is cordon these fields off, and hammer down signs along their borders warning people off.",
      "They also spray-paint warning messages on dirt barriers and houses around the edges of the fields. \"Danger \u2013 landmines ahead,\" they read.",
      "They lead campaigns to raise awareness among locals about the dangers of entering contaminated lands.",
      "On our way back, we come across one farmer in his 30s who has recently returned. He tells us that some of the land belongs to his family.",
      "\"We couldn't recognise any of it,\" Mohammed says. \"We used to plant wheat, barley, cumin and cotton. Now we cannot do anything. And as long as we cannot cultivate these lands, we will always be in poor economic condition,\" he adds, clearly frustrated.",
      "The White Helmets say they have identified and cordoned off around 117 minefields in just over a month.",
      "They are not the only ones working to clear mines and UXOs, but it seems that there is little co-ordination between the efforts of various organisations.",
      "There are no accurate statistics for the areas contaminated with UXOs or landmines. But international organisations, such as the Halo Trust, have drawn up approximate maps.",
      "Halo Syria programme manager Damian O'Brien says that a comprehensive survey needs to be done for the country to understand the scale of contamination. He estimates that around a million devices would need to be destroyed to protect civilian lives in Syria.",
      "\"Any Syrian army position is quite likely to have some landmines laid around it as a defensive technique,\" Mr O'Brien says.",
      "\"In places like Homs and Hama, there are entire neighbourhoods which have been almost completely destroyed. Anybody going into those structures to assess them, for either demolition or to rebuild them, needs to be aware that there may well be unexploded items in there, whether it's bullets, cluster munitions, grenades, shells.\"",
      "The White Helmets came across a treasure trove that could aid efforts in clearing mines. In their office in the city of Idlib, Mr Talfah shows us a stack of maps and documents, left behind by government forces.",
      "They show locations, numbers and types of mines planted in different fields across northwestern Syria.",
      "\"We will hand over these documents to the bodies that will deal with landmines directly,\" Mr Talfah says.",
      "But the local expertise currently available in Syria does not seem to be enough to combat the serious dangers that unexploded munitions pose to civilian life.",
      "Mr O'Brien stresses that the international community needs to work alongside the new government in Syria to improve expertise in the country.",
      "\"What we need from donors is the funding, to be able to expand our capacity, which means employing more people, buying more machines and operating over a wider area,\" he says.",

      "\"I never want any civilian or team member to go through what I have,\" he says.",
      "\"I cannot describe the feeling I get when I clear a danger threatening the life of civilians.\"",

      "Around the world a group of scientists, sailors and fishermen are anxiously checking satellite pictures to monitor the daily movements of this queen of icebergs.",
      "It is known as A23a and is one of the world's oldest.",
      "It calved, or broke off, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 but got stuck on the seafloor and then trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "Finally, in December, it broke free and is now on its final journey, speeding into oblivion.",
      "The warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its vast cliffs that tower up to 1,312ft (400m), taller than the Shard in London.",
      "It once measured 3,900 sq km, but the latest satellite pictures show it is slowly decaying. It is now around 3,500 sq km, roughly the size of the English county of  Cornwall.",
      "And large slabs of ice are breaking off, plunging into the waters around its edges.",
      "A23a could break into vast segments any day, which may then hang around for years, like floating cities of ice cruising uncontrollably around South Georgia.",
      "This isn't the first huge iceberg to threaten South Georgia and Sandwich Islands.",

      "The territory is home to precious colonies of King penguins and millions of elephant and fur seals.",
      "\"South Georgia sits in iceberg alley so impacts are to be expected for both fisheries and wildlife, and both have a great capacity to adapt,\" says Mark Belchier, a marine ecologist who advises the South Georgia government.",
      "Sailors and fisherman say icebergs are an increasing problem. In 2023 one called A76 gave them a scare when it came close to grounding.",
      "\"Chunks of it were tipping up, so they looked like great ice towers, an ice city on the horizon,\" says Mr Belchier, who saw the iceberg while at sea.",
      "Those slabs are still lingering around the islands today.",
      "\"It is in bits from the size of several Wembley stadiums down to pieces the size of your desk,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes, a fishing company that works in South Georgia.",
      "\"Those pieces basically cover the island - we have to work our way through it,\" says Captain Wallace.",
      "The sailors on his ship must be constantly vigilant. \"We have searchlights on all night to try to see ice - it can come from nowhere,\" he explains.",
      "A76 was a \"gamechanger\", according to Mr Newman, with \"huge impact on our operations and on keeping our vessel and crew safe\".",
      "All three men describe a rapidly changing environment, with glacial retreat visible year-to-year, and volatile levels of sea ice.",
      "Climate change is unlikely to have been behind the birth of A23a because it calved so long ago, before much of the impacts of rising temperatures that we are now seeing.",
      "But giant icebergs are part of our future. As Antarctica becomes more unstable with warmer ocean and air temperatures, more vast pieces of the ice sheets will break away.",
      "Before its time comes to an end though, A23a has left a parting gift for scientists.",
      "A team with the British Antarctic Survey on the Sir David Attenborough research vessel found themselves close to A23a in 2023.",
      "The scientists scrambled to exploit the rare opportunity to investigate what mega icebergs do to the environment.",
      "The ship sailed into a crack in the iceberg's gigantic walls, and PhD researcher Laura Taylor collected precious water samples 400m away from its cliffs.",
      "\"I saw a massive wall of ice way higher than me, as far as I could see. It has different colours in different places. Chunks were falling off - it was quite magnificent,\" she explains from her lab in Cambridge where she is now analysing the samples.",
      "Her work looks at what the impact the melt water is having on the carbon cycle in the southern ocean.",
      "\"This isn't just water like we drink. It's full of nutrients and chemicals, as well as tiny animals like phytoplankton frozen inside,\" Ms Taylor says.",
      "As it melts, the iceberg releases those elements into the water, changing the physics and chemistry of the ocean.",
      "That could store more carbon deep in the ocean, as the particles sink from the surface. That would naturally lock away some of the planet's carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change.",
      "Icebergs are notoriously unpredictable and no-one knows what exactly it will do next.",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has warned he will impose high tariffs and further sanctions on Russia if Vladimir Putin fails to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, he said that by pushing to settle the war he was doing Russia and its president a \"very big favour\".",
      "Trump had previously said he would negotiate a settlement to Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022, in a single day.",
      "Russia has not yet responded to the remarks, but senior officials have said in recent days that there is a small window of opportunity for Moscow to deal with the new US administration.",
      "Putin has said repeatedly that he is prepared to negotiate an end to the war, which first began in 2014, but that Ukraine would have to accept the reality of Russian territorial gains, which are currently about 20% of its land. He also refuses to allow Ukraine to join Nato, the military alliance of Western countries.",
      "Kyiv does not want to give up its territory, although President Volodymyr Zelensky has conceded he may have to cede some currently occupied land temporarily.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump told a news conference he would be talking to Putin \"very soon\" and it \"sounds likely\" that he would apply more sanctions if the Russian leader did not come to the table.",
      "But in his Truth Social post the next day, he went further: \"I'm going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don't make a 'deal', and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\"",
      "Continuing, he wrote: \"Let's get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It's time to 'MAKE A DEAL'.\"",

      "Trump's former special representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, said Trump's threat of more serious sanctions on Russia \"gives a signal to Vladimir Putin this is going to get worse, not better\". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"We should incentivise Putin to say, 'OK, it's time actually to have a ceasefire.'\"",
      "Russia's deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy earlier told Reuters news agency that the Kremlin would need to know what Trump wanted in a deal to stop the war before the country moves forward.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that at least 200,000 peacekeepers would be needed under any agreement.",
      "And he told Bloomberg that any peacekeeping force for his country would have to include US troops to pose a realistic deterrent to Russia.",
      "\"It can't be without the United States... Even if some European friends think it can be, no, it will not be,\" he said, adding that no-one else would risk such a move without the US.",
      "While Ukraine's leaders might appreciate this tougher-talking Trump - they have always said Putin only understands strength - the initial reaction in Kyiv to the US president's comments suggest that it is actions people are waiting for, not words.",
      "Trump has not specified where more economic penalties might be aimed, or when. Russian imports to the US have plummeted since 2022 and there are all sorts of heavy restrictions already in place.",
      "Currently, the main Russian exports to the US are phosphate-based fertilisers and platinum.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Volker said the Russian economy could take \"substantial\" damage if Trump chose to preserve or strengthen the toughest US sanctions so far, which he said were only levied as Trump's predecessor Joe Biden left office. \"Russia really didn't feel as much pressure as they could,\" he commented.",
      "On social media, there was a generally scathing response to Trump's comments from Ukrainians. Many suggested that more sanctions would be a weak reply to Russian aggression. But the biggest question for most is what Putin is actually open to discussing with Ukraine at any peace talks.",
      "In Moscow meanwhile, some people are seeing signs that the Kremlin may be readying Russians to accept less than the \"victory\" once envisaged, which included tanks rolling all the way west to the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa.",
      "TV editor Margarita Simonyan, who is stridently pro-Putin, has begun talking of \"realistic\" conditions for ending the war, which she suggests could include halting the fighting along the current frontline.",
      "That would mean the four Ukrainian regions that Putin illegally pronounced as Russian territory more than two years ago, including Zaporizhzhia, still being partially controlled by Kyiv.",
      "Russian hardliners, the so-called \"Z\" bloggers, are furious at such \"defeatism\".",
      "In his BBC interview on Thursday, Trump's former envoy Volker said he was \"sceptical that there is going to be a deal per se\", adding that the first priority of the US could be to stop the fighting and then deter more attacks by Putin.",
      "In Wednesday's social media post, Trump also couched his threat of tariffs and tighter sanctions in words of \"love\" for the Russian people and highlighted his respect for Soviet losses in World War Two \u2013 a near-sacred topic for Putin.",
      "But Trump massively overestimated the numbers and appeared to think the USSR was Russia alone. In reality, millions of Ukrainians and other Soviet citizens also lost their lives.",
      "That said, the man who previously said he could \"understand\" Russia's concerns about Ukraine joining Nato - which for Kyiv is tantamount to saying Putin was provoked - does seem to be shifting his tone.",
      "Trump's position matters. But after 11 years of war with Russia and a history of poor peace deals, Ukrainians are not inclined to be too hopeful."

He was there for 12 days.",

      "\"Naturally, all our themes are related to the war. Because it's our life now. Stand-up comedy is a frank genre where comedians speak about their own experiences or thoughts,\" Ms Kochehura says.",

    "story": [
      "For more than 50 years, one family has dedicated itself to caring for the biggest graveyard in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna - much to the gratitude of other residents who do not fancy the job of dealing with the dead.",
      "Until a few weeks ago, they did it for no formal pay - digging graves, washing corpses and tending to the vast cemetery, receiving only small donations from mourners for their labour.",
      "The vast Tudun Wada Cemetery was set aside for the Muslim residents of the city by the authorities a century ago.",
      "The Abdullahi family became involved in the 1970s when two brothers - Ibrahim and Adamu - began working there.",
      "The two siblings now lie beneath the soil in the graveyard, and their sons have become the cemetery's main custodians.",
      "\"Their teachings to us, their children, was that God loves the service and would reward us for it even if we don't get any worldly gains,\" Ibrahim Abdullahi's oldest son Magaji told the BBC when asked why they had chosen to continue as unpaid undertakers.",
      "The 58-year-old is now in charge at Tudun Wada - shepherding operations and the 18 members of staff or until recently - volunteers.",
      "He and his two younger cousins - Abdullahi, 50, and Aliyu, 40, (Adamu Abdullahi's sons) - are the three full-time workers, all reporting in by 07:00 for a 12-hour shift, seven days a week.",
      "They always need to be on call because, according to Muslim rites, a burial must be organised within a few hours of someone's death.",
      "Magaji tends to get the call on his mobile, either directly from a relative or an imam - all religious clerics in the city have his number.",
      "\"A lot of people have our numbers and as soon as someone dies, we get a call and immediately we get to work,\" he says.",
      "One of the trio goes to tend to the corpse, which may include washing it and wrapping it in a shroud.",
      "The body is measured and those details are texted back to the others so that a grave can be dug.",
      "This can take around an hour - with two people taking it in turns to dig down 6ft (1.8m) into the earth - sometimes longer when it is in a stony area of the graveyard.",
      "They can dig around a dozen graves in a day - hard work in the Kaduna heat.",
      "\"Today alone we have dug eight graves and it's not even noon, some days are like that,\" says Abdullahi, who began work at the cemetery when he was aged 20.",
      "The cousins have experienced very stressful times - especially during religious violence when tensions flare between the city's Christian and Muslim residents. The two communities tend to live on opposite sides of the Kaduna River.",
      "\"We have had a couple of religious clashes in Kaduna but the one that sticks the most for me was one in the early 1990s. A lot of people were killed,\" says Magaji.",
      "\"We went round gathering the corpses and taking them off the streets.\"",
      "Muslims were taken to Tudun Wada in the north of the city and Christians to graveyards in the southern suburbs.",
      "\"It was such a troubling time personally and I wasn't long in the job then but that helped enhance my resolve to continue,\" he says.",
      "Usually, while the team digs a grave, at the local mosque the imam announces during one of the five daily prayers that a funeral will be taking place.",
      "Many of the worshippers then go to where the body has been prepared for prayers - it is then transported to the graveyard for burial, often thronged by the mourners.",
      "Once by the graveside, the shrouded body is lowered - it is covered with a layer of sticks and broken clay pots as a mark of respect. The grave is then filled to form a slightly raised bed.",
      "After the rituals are complete and before the mourners leave, the graveyard keepers appeal for donations.",
      "This is usually done by 72-year-old Inuwa Mohammed, the oldest worker at the cemetery, who explains the importance of Abdullahi family to the community.",
      "He used to work with the cousins' fathers: \"They were amazing people who loved what they did and have imbibed their children with this altruistic behaviour.\"",
      "The little money collected will sometimes buy lunch for the crew - but is never enough for anything else. In order to survive, the family also has a small farm where they grow food.",
      "The graves are recycled after 40 years, meaning land is not a big issue - but maintenance is.",
      "\"There is a lot that is lacking at the moment - we don't have enough equipment to work with, or good security,\" says Aliyu, the youngest of the cousins and who has worked there for 10 years.",
      "He explains how part of the wall has collapsed, allowing those on the look-out for scrap metal to steal the grave markers.",
      "Some of the graves have metal plates inscribed with a name and date of birth and death \u2013 though many do not as Islamic clerics do not encourage ostentation. Most are just outlined by stones and bricks or with a stick.",
      "Either way, the cousins remember the location of everyone buried at the cemetery and can direct people if they have forgotten the location of a relative's grave.",
      "Following the BBC's recent visit to the graveyard, they have seen a dramatic change in fortune.",
      "The new local council chairman, whose office oversees the site, has decided to put them on the payroll.",
      "\"They deserve it, given the massive work they do every day,\" Rayyan Hussain tells the BBC.",
      "\"Graves are the final homes for us all and people who do this kind of hard work deserve to be paid, so my office would pay them as long as I am chairman.\"",
      "Magaji confirms that the staff have started receiving a monthly salary for the first time:",
      "the five oldest, including himself, are getting 43,000 naira ($28; \u00a322.50)the others, including Abdullahi and Aliyu, are receiving 20,000 naira ($13; \u00a310.50).",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Some survivors did not hear a fire alarm and there are claims of failures in the hotel's fire safety.",
    "story": [
      "The fire that killed 78 people at the Grand Kartal Hotel in the early hours of Monday is one of the deadliest disasters of its kind in Turkish history.",
      "Some survivors have said they did not hear an alarm and experts have told the BBC they would not have expected such a high death toll in a hotel where fire protection systems were working properly.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "The 12-storey hotel at Turkey's popular Kartalkaya ski resort hosts tens of thousands of visitors every year, so Turks understandably want to know how such a terrible tragedy could have happened at the start of a two-week school holiday.",
      "The interior minister said the fire started at 03:27 (00:27 GMT) in the restaurant area on the fourth floor and firefighters arrived within 45 minutes.",
      "Some survivors have described smelling smoke as much as an hour earlier.",
      "Culture and Tourism minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel had a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\".",
      "But that has been challenged by local mayor Tanju Ozcan, who said the fire department had not issued a positive report since 2007.",
      "Some survivors say they heard no alarm, while there have been claims of inadequacies in the hotel's fire extinguishing systems.",
      "\"My wife smelled the fire,\" said Atakan Yelkovan, who said he was staying on the third floor of the hotel.",
      "\"We went down earlier than others. The alarm did not go off... It took about an hour to an hour-and-a-half for the fire brigade to come. In the meantime, the fourth and fifth floors were burning. People on the upper floors were screaming.\"",
      "Some guests on higher floors tried to escape with their bedding and some jumped to their deaths.",
      "Eylem Senturk said the fire alarm did not go off until she was out of the building. Her husband had to jump off the hotel porch because of the smoke: \"We are very lucky to have survived.\"",
      "The BBC has tried to contact the hotel's managers regarding these allegations but has so far received no response.",
      "Eleven people, including the hotel owner, have been detained as part of the Turkish investigation.",
      "Hotel managers have issued a statement saying they mourn the losses and are co-operating fully with the authorities.",

      "Children among hotel fire dead as investigation continues",
      "Dozens killed as fire engulfs Turkish ski hotel",
      "What should have happened?",
      "In such a big building where fire systems are fully operational, experts say fire detectors are expected to respond to a fire within seconds and send an alert to a fire control dashboard.",
      "\"In a good business, there should be someone in charge of this panel 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\" Kazim Beceren, president of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation, told the BBC.",
      "The death toll is also extremely high, which raises further questions.",
      "\"There will always be fires, but we would not expect so many people to die in this type of building,\" said Prof Sevket Ozgur Atayilmaz, head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Yildiz Technical University, who has worked on fire safety planning.",
      "\"If the structure is designed correctly for fire, if there are escape routes, and if the smoke is evacuated correctly, it is possible to overcome the fire without loss of life.\"",
      "The interior minister said there were two fire escapes, but there are indications they were not of a good standard.",
      "Were fire safety measures in place?",
      "An official from the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) in Bolu, Erol Percin, said the way the fire had spread suggested that fire warning, detection and extinguishing systems might not have been present.",
      "He said the building's exterior wooden facade should have been 100% fire-resistant, but that did not appear to be the case.",
      "The head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation told the BBC that the size of the fire suggested that \"the fire system either does not exist or was not designed in accordance with the standards\".",
      "There were 238 people staying in the Grand Kartal Hotel at the time.",
      "Kazim Beceren said fire safety systems were designed with the aim of taking three minutes to evacuate each floor - and a facility with more than 200 people could be evacuated in 15 to 30 minutes under ideal conditions.",
      "When an alarm goes off, the person in charge of the fire control dashboard is expected to check the location, according to the head of the Turkish Fire Protection and Education Foundation.",
      "If there is no indication of a false alarm or if a second detector sends a warning, fire alarms are then normally activated throughout the building.",
      "In a properly installed system, people are then directed by announcement to the nearest fire exits, with flashing lights for people who are hearing-impaired or audible warnings for those sleeping.",
      "As fires can spread very quickly, sprinkler systems are seen as highly important for intervention at an early stage.",
      "So too is a back-up power source. According to fire protection regulations, signs pointing to emergency exits and lights showing the paths to these exits have to work for one to three hours, even if there is a power outage.",
      "The engineers' and architects' union in Bolu said in a statement that \"an automatic sprinkler system is mandatory\" in buildings of this size.",
      "\"The photos on the hotel's website show that the automatic sprinkler system, which was supposed to be installed in 2008, was not installed. Because of this failure, the fire spread rapidly and there were casualties.\"",
      "BBC Turkish has not been able to independently confirm the allegations about either the wooden cladding on the building or the hotel's fire extinguishing system.",
      "Who checked the hotel's fire safety?",
      "One of the big questions is whether the hotel's fire systems were properly inspected.",
      "Bolu Mayor Tanju Ozcan said the ministry of tourism was responsible as the hotel was beyond the boundary of his town. Erol Percin agreed.",
      "The mayor said that the last time Bolu's municipality had given a report stating the hotel was fireproof was in 2007, and there had been no such checks since then.",
      "However, Culture and Tourism Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said the hotel did have a fire competence certificate \"issued by the fire department\" and inspections were down to them.",
      "There have also been calls for relatively old structures to come under scrutiny because of changing legislation.",
      "\"Places should stop operating if they  do not comply with current standards, in crowded places such as hotels, residences, nursing homes or kindergartens,\" says Prof Atayilmaz of Yildiz Technical University."

    "summary": "The US president says the US should \"take back\" the famous waterway because China runs it now.",
    "story": [
      "During his inaugural address, President Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that China runs the Panama Canal.",
      "\"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back,\" he said.",
      "The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "Up to 14,000 ships use it each year as a shortcut to a journey which, before the canal was built, would have taken them on a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America.",
      "What has Trump said about the canal?",
      "The mention of Panama in his inaugural speech is not the first time he has focused on the Central American nation and its transoceanic canal.",
      "On Christmas Day, Trump posted on social media that the \"wonderful soldiers of China\" were \"lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal\" - a claim which was swiftly denied by officials in Panama City and Beijing.",
      "At the time, Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino described the claim as \"nonsense\", stressing that there was \"absolutely no Chinese interference\" in the canal.",
      "Trump has also threatened to take the canal back by force, citing \"exorbitant\" fees being allegedly charged for US vessels to pass through it - another claim rejected by Panamanian authorities.",
      "Following Trump's inauguration address, President Mulino again stressed that there was \"no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration\" of the Panama Canal.",
      "The strategic waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government, not Chinese soldiers.",
      "However, Mr Trump's inaccurate claim reflects the concerns of some US officials over China's significant investments in the canal and its surrounding infrastructure.",
      "What is the history of Panama Canal?",
      "Historically, the US played a pivotal role in the construction and administration of the passage, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "After a failed attempt by the French to build it, the US secured the rights to undertake the project. The canal's construction was completed in 1914.",
      "It remained under US control until 1977, when then President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty to gradually hand it over to Panama, which Trump has referred to as \"foolish\".",
      "Since 1999, the Panama Canal Authority has held exclusive control over the operations of the waterway.",
      "The treaties signed by both the US and Panama stipulated that it shall remain permanently neutral, but the US reserves the right to defend any threat to the canal's neutrality using military force under this deal.",
      "What is China's role in the operations of the canal?",
      "There is no public evidence to suggest that the Chinese government exercises control over the canal, or its military. However, Chinese companies have a significant presence there.",
      "From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the Panama Canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",
      "In recent years, China has also invested heavily in ports and terminals near the canal.",
      "Two of the\u202ffive ports\u202fadjacent to the canal, Balboa and Crist\u00f3bal, which sit on the Pacific and Atlantic sides respectively, have been operated by a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings since 1997.",
      "The company is a subsidiary of the publicly listed CK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate founded by Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing.",
      "It has port operations\u202fin 24 countries, including the UK.",
      "Although it is not state-owned by China, says Ryan Berg, director of the  Americas Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, there have been concerns in Washington over how much control Beijing would be able to exert over the company.",
      "A wealth of potentially useful strategic information on ships passing through the waterway flows through these ports.",
      "\"There is an increasing geopolitical tension of economic nature between the US and China,\" Mr Berg says. \"That kind of information regarding cargo would be very useful in the event of a supply chain war.\"",
      "CK Hutchison did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "The bids to operate those ports faced almost no competition, according to Andrew Thomas, a professor at the University of Akron who has written a book on the canal. \"The US at the time didn't really care about these ports and Hutchison faced no objection,\" he says.",
      "Chinese companies, both private and state-owned, have also strengthened their presence in Panama through billions of dollars in investments, including a cruise terminal and a bridge to be built over the canal.",
      "This \"package of Chinese activities\", as described by Mr Thomas, might have prompted Trump's assertion that the canal is \"owned\" by China, but operation of those ports does not equate to ownership, he stresses.",
      "Beijing has repeatedly said that China's ties with Latin America are characterised by \"equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and benefits for the people\".",
      "What are China's broader interests in Panama?",
      "Panama's strategic location means China has been vying to increase its influence in the country for years and expand its footprint on a continent that has traditionally been considered the \"backyard\" of the US.",
      "In 2017, Panama broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established formal relations with China \u2013 a huge win for Chinese diplomacy.",
      "Months later, Panama became the first Latin American country to join China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar global infrastructure and investment initiative.",
      "The Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras followed suit and also severed ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing.",

    "title": "'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 03:09:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Thailand is set to legalise same-sex marriage - one of the few places in Asia to do so. Why is it an outlier?",
    "story": [
      "\"It has been a long fight full of tears for us.\"",
      "That is how Ann \"Waaddao\" Chumaporn describes the years that led to this moment \u2013 when hundreds of couples are tying the knot as Thailand legalises same-sex marriage.",
      "And the same question which has been heard throughout the long campaign to get the equal marriage law passed is being asked again: why Thailand? Why nowhere else, aside from Taiwan and Nepal, in Asia?",
      "People think they know the answer. Thailand is famously open to and accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. They have long been visible in all walks of life. Thai people are easy-going about pretty much everything. \"Mai pen rai\" \u2013 no big deal \u2013 is a national catch-phrase. Buddhist beliefs, followed by more than 90% of Thais, don't forbid LGBT lifestyles. Surely, then, equal marriage was inevitable.",
      "Except it wasn't. \"It was not easy,\" says Ms Waaddao, who organises Bangkok Pride March.",
      "The first Pride march in Thailand took place only 25 years ago. Back then it was hard to get approval from the police, and the march was a chaotic, unfocused event. After 2006 only two marches took place until 2022. In 2009 one planned Pride march in Chiang Mai had to be abandoned because of the threat of violence.",
      "\"We were not accepted, by our own families and by society,\" Ms Waaddao adds. \"There were times when we did not think marriage equality would ever happen, but we never gave up.\"",
      "'We did not fight, we negotiated'",
      "For all of Thailand's general tolerance of LGBT people, getting equal rights, including marriage, required a determined campaign to change attitudes in Thai officialdom and society. And attitudes have changed.",
      "When Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira started dating his partner in 2001, they were both actors playing leading roles in TV series. At that time homosexuality was still officially described by the Thai Ministry of Health as a mental illness.",
      "Are you in a same sex relationship in Thailand? Get in touch.",
      "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples",
      "Why legalising gay sex in India is not a Western idea",
      "\"Back then society could not accept leading male roles being played by a gay man. There was lots of gossip about us in the media, much of it untrue, which really stressed us,\" Mr Chakkrit recalls.",
      "\"We decided then that if we were going to date each other, we had to leave showbiz.\"",
      "They are still together but they have stayed out of the limelight for more than 20 years, running a successful production company.",
      "A lot has changed in that time \u2013 and their industry gets some credit for that.",
      "The way LGBT characters are portrayed in Thai TV dramas, from comical oddities to mainstream roles, made a big difference, according to Tinnaphop Sinsomboonthong, an assistant professor at Thammasat University who self-identifies as queer.",
      "\"Nowadays they represent us as normal characters, like you see in real life,\" he says. \"The kind of LGBTQ+ colleague you might have in the office, or your LGBTQ+ neighbour.  This really helped change perceptions and values in all generations.\"",
      "The so-called Boy Love dramas have helped bring the rest of society round to the idea of not just tolerance, but full acceptance and equal rights for the community.",
      "These romantic television dramas featuring love affairs between beautiful young men have grown enormously in popularity over the past decade, especially during the Covid pandemic.",
      "They are now one of Thailand's most successful cultural exports, with huge audiences in places like China. Series like My School President and Love Sick have got hundreds of millions of views on streaming networks.",
      "At the same time, activists became more focused and united in their bid to get the law changed. The many different LGBT groups came together in the Change 1448 campaign \u2013 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage \u2013 and later under the Rainbow Coalition for Marriage Equality.",
      "They linked up with other groups fighting for greater rights and freedoms in Thailand, and they learned to work with political parties in parliament to persuade them to change their stance on the law.",
      "The resumption of Pride marches in 2022, and getting the government to recognise and promote the appeal of Thailand as an attractive destination for LGBT travellers also helped change public perceptions.",
      "\"We did not fight, we negotiated,\" Mr Tinnaphop says. \"We knew we had to talk to Thai society, and little by little, we shifted attitudes.\"",
      "The right political moment",
      "Getting the equal marriage law through parliament was also helped by political developments in Thailand.",
      "For five years following a coup in 2014, the country was ruled by a conservative military government, which was willing only to consider recognising civil partnerships for LGBT couples, without full rights like inheritance.",
      "But in the 2019 election which returned Thailand to civilian rule, a new, youthful reformist party called Future Forward, which fully supported equal marriage, did unexpectedly well. They won the third-largest share of seats, revealing a growing hunger for change in Thailand.",
      "When a year later Future Forward was dissolved by a controversial court verdict, it set off months of student-led protests calling for sweeping reforms, including curbs to the monarchy's power.",
      "LGBT campaigners were prominent in those protests, giving them greater national prominence. The protests eventually died down, with many of the leaders arrested for questioning the monarchy's role.",
      "But in the 2023 election the successor to Future Forward, calling itself Move Forward, performed even better than in 2019, winning more seats than any other party. Again, it was clear that the desire for change was felt across Thai people of all ages.",
      "Move Forward was blocked from forming a government by conservatives who objected to its call for wholesale political reforms.",
      "But by this time, equal marriage was less contentious. Few opposed it. And passing it gave the unwieldy and unpopular coalition government which had been formed without Move Forward a quick accomplishment with which to please most of the country.",
      "Pioneering move may boost tourism",
      "Thailand, though, is an outlier in Asia. Few other countries in the region are likely to follow suit.",
      "The influence of Islam in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei makes the notion of equal marriage a non-starter. LGBT communities there face discrimination and prosecution; in Brunei sex between men carries the death penalty.",
      "In the Philippines, there is growing acceptance of LGBT couples living together openly. But the Roman Catholic Church vehemently opposes same-sex marriage.",
      "In Vietnam, like Thailand, there are no religious or ideological obstacles, but campaigning to change the law, as happened in Thailand, is difficult under a repressive regime. Much the same is true in China. Until the ruling communist party endorses equal marriage, which it shows no signs of doing, it cannot happen.",
      "Even in democracies like Japan and South Korea \u2013 where political parties are largely conservative and dominated by older men - the prospects look bleak.",
      "\"It is largely conservative Christians who are blocking it,\" says Chae-yoon Han, executive director of the Beyond the Rainbow Foundation in South Korea.",
      "\"Most, if not all, politicians in the conservative party of President Yoon are devout Christians, and they have framed marriage equality as a 'leftist agenda', which could potentially open society to a 'leftist, communist takeover'.\"",
      "India appeared close to legalising same-sex marriage in 2023, when the decision fell to its Supreme Court - but the judges declined, saying it was up to parliament.",
      "So Thailand hopes to benefit from being a pioneer. Tourism is one of the few areas of the Thai economy doing well in the post-pandemic recovery, and the country is seen as a safe and welcoming destination for LGBT holiday-makers.",
      "Growing numbers of same-sex couples from other Asian countries are choosing to live here now.",
      "The legal recognition they can get for their marriages will allow them to raise children and grow old together with nearly all the rights and protections given to heterosexual couples.",

    "story": [
      "Nominations for the 97th annual Academy Awards are being announced Thursday morning after being delayed twice due to the Los Angeles area wildfires.",
      "Actors Bowen Yang and Rachel Sennott are tapped to host Thursday's live announcement with the nominees expected to be revealed starting at 8:30 a.m. EST (5:30 a.m. PST).",
      "What movies are predicted to get Oscar nominations?",
      "While many expect to see blockbusters like \"Wicked\" and \"Dune: Part Two\" among this year's top nominees, the awards leading up to this moment in the movie awards season also suggest that smaller, critically acclaimed movies like \"Anora,\" \"The Brutalist\" and \"Conclave\" will be among this year's most-nominated films.",
      "The latter film, an adaptation of a Robert Harris novel showcasing expected best actor nominee Ralph Fiennes as the representative overseeing a contentious papal conclave, received the most BAFTA nominations of any movie last year with 12. The voting body at BAFTA includes a significant overlap with the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who determine each year's Oscar nominees, so a strong performance at the former organization is generally considered to be an encouraging bellwether for the latter.",
      "Close behind \"Conclave\" in overall BAFTA nominations with 11 is \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" a crime musical centering around a cartel leader who has transitioned. Actress Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, playing the titular role, could make Oscar history by being the first transgender woman to be nominated in any acting category.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" won four Golden Globes earlier this month, including best motion picture musical or comedy, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a's performance. \"The Brutalist,\" a 215-minute epic about a Holocaust survivor who emigrates to America post-WWII, won Golden Globes for best motion picture drama, and lead actor Adrian Brody was also a Globe winner.",
      "Another Globe winner expected to earn an Academy Award nomination Thursday morning: Demi Moore, whose performance in the bloody body horror hit \"The Substance\" has stirred up a conversation on the industry's mistreatment of women of an age. Both Moore and the film itself are expected to get nominations in the top Oscar categories.",
      "When is the Oscar awards ceremony?",
      "The nominations were originally scheduled for Jan. 17 but, as with a number of other industry awards ceremonies that traditionally make up Hollywood's social calendar in January, the proliferation of wildfires in the Los Angeles area had organizers scrambling to reschedule. The Oscars nominees luncheon has been canceled, the academy says. It had been scheduled for Feb. 10.",

And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "It was the tail end of June 1968; the air was starting to get humid. Fourth grade was ending, and I could feel the three months of delirium that was coming.",
      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",
      "And wouldn't you know it? Someone noticed.",
      "\"What the hell is going on?\" I heard my mother say downstairs. \"Stanley, I smell smoke.\"",
      "\"Check the air conditioners,\" my father said. \"I'm going to look at the attic.\"",
      "I heard my father's footsteps as he rushed up to the attic, praying that he would skip past the bathroom I'd turned into my private gunpowder studio. But then he started banging on the door.",
      "\"Steven? What the hell are you doing in there?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",
      "\"Open this door, now!\"",
      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",
      "I went to my trusty desk drawer and slid it open. He was the only human to ever see that cache\u2014other than Andy Mahoney.",
      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",
      "\"They're called belts, Dad,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows\u2014not the right answer. \"I got them using my newspaper route money.\"",
      "He reached into the drawer and, with one giant hand, grabbed the bulk of them.",
      "\"Follow me.\"",
      "We headed outside. I was sure that we were going to the garbage pails, but he walked right past them.",
      "\"You and me are going to light every firecracker in these belts and finish them off.\"",
      "I was going to light firecrackers with my father? These were contraband, but he\u2014an ex-cop\u2014was willing to put himself in harm's way for me? That's a dad. That's a father.",
      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",
      "\"Here, you light some,\" he said. \"I've got an extra Zippo.\"",
      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",
      "\"What the hell are you two doing?\" my mother said, her head halfway out the bedroom window.",
      "\"We're lighting firecrackers, Ann. My partner and me.\"",
      "His partner. Dad called me his partner. It was like I'd joined the Yankees and the Mets all at once.",
      "There we stood, for hours, as the sun set over the mimosa tree. I looked up at my dad: my hero, my partner. We lit every last one. Of course, one blew up between my fingers; the pain was spectacular, but I didn't dare tell. This was too good.",
      "It was dark as we lit the last few. They unwrapped and exploded in the air, illuminating the backyard with blasts of light.",
      "\"That's it, Steven. We're done. Good job.\"",
      "I walked back into the house a little changed. A little more trust from my dad. A little bit more like a man.",

    "title": "Tamara de Lempicka's vibrant life and art",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "\"The FDA is aware of reports of death or illness associated with uncooked food in 13 domestic cats in eight households, 1 exotic cat in one household, and an unknown number of animals at two sanctuaries for large felids,\" an FDA official said in a statement.",
      "Cases have been in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, the FDA said.",
      "Investigators are now working to trace back the outbreaks, the official said. Testing is underway but could take several weeks to yield results to pin down the source.",
      "It is unclear how the virus spread into pet food. Taxpayers have funded record numbers of poultry being culled in an effort to stem\u00a0bird flu outbreaks, and U.S. officials said this month that farmers are not allowed to use meat from those birds in pet food.",
      "\"Affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA's efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all. They are most frequently composted on site, as part of the efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" Eric Deeble, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told reporters last week.",
      "While bird flu has largely spared many of the humans and cows sickened by this past year's outbreaks in the U.S. from death or severe disease, officials have warned that the virus is especially lethal to cats.",
      "In response, the FDA said Friday it would order manufacturers of uncooked cat and dog foods to take steps to curb further spread.",
      "Potential risks of raw pet food",
      "Raw and minimally processed pet foods make up a minority of U.S. pet food sales, but the consulting firm OC&C said\u00a0last year\u00a0that there's been \"rapid growth\" in the market.",
      "The American Animal Hospital Association says it does not endorse feeding pets raw protein food. The group warns that \"overwhelming scientific evidence\" shows it puts animals and the humans around them at risk of disease.",
      "To comply with the new requirements, producers either need to start cooking their products or come up with another way to cut the risk in their food safety plans.",
      "\"As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to significantly minimize or prevent H5N1 transmission through animal food,\" the agency said.",
      "The move also prompted the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to step up oversight of turkey slaughter, after a bird flu strain detected in raw pet food and an infected cat was linked to a turkey flock.",
      "Under the program, APHIS said it would require turkeys to undergo isolation and extra testing in some states before they could be slaughtered.",
      "Health officials in California last year had warned against feeding pets recalled raw milk and a local raw pet food brand, Monarch Raw Pet Food, after a probe of cat deaths. Monarch has disputed the allegation, saying there is \"no credible evidence\" that their products were to blame.",
      "Oregon's agriculture department also warned of an outbreak last year also linked to raw turkey pet food by Northwest Naturals, which had been sold in a dozen states and Canada. Officials in Oregon confirmed to CBS News this month that the FDA had taken over the investigation.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks in poultry and dairy herds",
      "U.S. officials and farmers have braced in recent winters for an uptick in outbreaks, as migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south from Canada.",
      "This winter's migration started around a month later than usual, U.S. officials say, delaying when the surge of bird flu began to hit farmers hard.",
      "\"Apparently it was a very seasonally warm fall and early winter further north, and so that kept a lot of those birds up co-mingling with each other further north, before they started the fall migration,\" said Alex Turner, the USDA's national incident coordinator for the outbreak.",
      "Turner said they expect that could lead to the surge in bird flu subsiding a month later, as the amount of virus lingering in the environment from their migration starts to wind down.",
      "\"Now that they are predominantly kind of where they're going to be for the winter, there's a little bit less of that migratory movement and exposure,\" said Turner.",
      "This is on top of ongoing outbreaks from a different strain that spilled over into dairy herds in 2023. That virus has spread back from cows to birds at nearby poultry farms in some cases.",
      "That may be what happened in Northwest Naturals. Oregon's agriculture department said the strain in the turkey product was B3.13, the same as the bird flu virus fueling the dairy outbreaks.",

      "Attorneys for the Biden administration said Friday they would seek to challenge a court loss last year that could pave the way for the Trump administration to ban the use of fluoride in water.",
      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",
      "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to continue the appeal.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has advocated for removing fluoride from public water supplies and said last year that Trump intends to call for an end to fluoridation.",
      "Trump has said he was open to the idea but has not yet detailed plans. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"If the new administration did want to take a different course with respect to fluoridation policies, it has unquestionably the authority to stand down on this appeal, and to initiate rulemaking proceeding to address the risk of fluoridation,\" said Connett.",
      "The court ruling in September stemmed in large part from a review published by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels of fluoride exposure\" are associated with lower IQ in children.",
      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",

      "Not all local governments have stuck with their decision to stop fluoridating water. In Canada, Calgary's city council decided to reintroduce fluoride after cavity rates worsened in children.",
      "\"I hope this is sufficiently convincing to the leadership in the city of Calgary, Alberta, that they see the harm that stopping fluoridation has happened to the children of their city,\" said University of California San Francisco Professor Howard Pollick, in a post by the American Dental Association in 2021, after a study on higher cavity rates in the city.",

    "summary": "Mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. could hurt a range of U.S. industries, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "In one of his first acts after returning to the Oval Office this week, President Trump tasked federal agencies with developing ways to potentially ease prices for U.S. consumers. But experts warn that his administration's crackdown on immigration could both drive up inflation as well as hurt a range of businesses by shrinking the nation's workforce.",
      "\"A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages, which has different sector implications including inflationary pressure, especially for food prices,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said labor shortages stemming from the Trump administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants could curtail the production of some products and services.",
      "\"Ultimately, the main way immigration affects inflation is that if jobs are left open and production is unable to keep up with demand, that's going to lead to higher prices,\" he said.",
      "What sectors depend most on immigrant labor?",
      "According to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies of New York and other groups, roughly 8.3 million undocumented immigrants work in the U.S, or just over 5% of the country's workforce.",
      "Undocumented immigrants account for about 20% of the agriculture industry's overall workforce, although that figure can rise to roughly half for some speciality farms, according to Capital Economics, which advises large investors.",
      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

      "Lutnick also agreed to step down from his position with the global brokerage and financial technology company BGC Group, Inc., which holds sizeable government contracts, and he has agreed to depart as chairman of Newmark Group, Inc., a commercial real estate firm, according to an ethics filing obtained by CBS News.",
      "That document and a 92-page financial disclosure report Lutnick filed late Wednesday offer a glimpse into considerable challenges of divestiture facing the long list of super-wealthy executives who have sought positions in the incoming Trump administrations.",
      "Lutnick has pledged to avoid conflicts of interest that may arise as he works to promote U.S. corporate interests atop the Commerce Department. As someone who will retain vast holdings even after he steps down from his corporate positions, the task will be complex.",
      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Mr. Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports. More recently, Mr. Trump has said a 10% tariff on goods from China could be imposed as soon as February, and he threatened tariffs of 25% against Canada and Mexico.",
      "In recent years Cantor Fitzgerald has become heavily involved in the crypto space, backing one company in particular, Tether. Cantor stands to benefit from the Trump administration's stated support for weakening crypto regulation.",
      "The firm is still widely known for absorbing devastating losses during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when about two-thirds of its New York-based workforce perished, including Lutnick's brother.",
      "Lutnick donated millions to the effort to reelect Trump and other Republicans. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump last August that raised $15 million and also gave $5 million to the Make America Great Again PAC, according to Federal Election Commission records.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAi's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has a new target in its sights for trimming federal spending: the U.S. penny.",
      "In Tuesday X post, Musk's DOGE wrote that the U.S. spends about 3 cents to mint each penny, which, of course, is only valued at 1 cent.",
      "\"The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost U.S. taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023,\" DOGE wrote. \"The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.\"",
      "In pointing out the penny's costliness, DOGE is taking aim at an issue that has sparked debate for years, although the price of manufacturing the cent has only grown over the past several years. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. was spending about 1.5 cents to mint each penny, or less than half of its current manufacturing cost.",
      "Still, the cent's $179 million in costs represents mere metaphorical pennies when it comes to DOGE's mandate to cut federal spending. President Donald Trump has said DOGE will provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\" Musk has said the group will aim to trim $500 billion in annual federal spending.",

      "Federal officials have proposed suspending the penny in prior years, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pushing the idea in 2015. Some economists have also advocated for dropping the penny from circulation, but there could be a costly downside to ditching the cent, as transactions would be rounded to 5-cent intervals, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a 2020 blog post.",
      "\"For a single item or small-value purchase, rounding up or down could represent a significant price change,\" the post noted.",
      "Other nations have ditched their equivalent of the penny, including Canada, which stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. One 2018 economic analysis found that Canadian consumers paid about $3.27 million in additional Canadian dollars at grocery stores each year due to prices being rounded higher after the change.",
      "\"On the other hand, there may be additional, hard-to-quantify costs to using pennies that would argue in favor of elimination. Counting pennies to make change takes time, and as the old business adage goes, time is money,\" the Richmond Fed noted.",

      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:19:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "Kelly \u2014 whose union represents employees with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration, among other agencies \u2014 also called Mr. Trump's directives \"a blatant attempt to corrupt the federal government by eliminating employees' due process rights so they can be fired for political reasons.\"",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union filed suit against the president's \"Schedule F\" executive order, a directive that makes it easier for the Trump administration to fire career government employees.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:51:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

    "summary": "Donald and Melania Trump launched new cryptocurrencies over the weekend. Some experts are advising investors to be cautious.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

      "A sweeping federal cost-cutting effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is facing multiple lawsuits, with the litigation coinciding with President Trump's January\u00a0inauguration.",
      "One suit, filed Monday by a public interest law firm called National Security Counselors, claims DOGE is operating as a federal advisory committee. That puts the initiative in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",
      "FACA requires these groups to be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" the lawsuit states. The lawsuit was filed shortly after noon Eastern time in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, National Security Counselors told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The law requires that advisory committees are \"objective and accessible to the public,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "A coalition representing veterans, public health professionals, teachers and other groups also filed a suit Monday against DOGE, citing FACA and asking a court to block DOGE's activities until it complies with law.",
      "\"The question every American should be asking is 'What are they hiding?'\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"DOGE must not be allowed to operate in the shadows without the transparency, oversight, and opportunity for public participation required of any federal department by the law.\"",
      "Neither the Trump campaign nor Elon Musk immediately responded to a request for comment. Ramaswamy is expected to step away from DOGE as he embarks on a campaign for Ohio governor later this month.",
      "DOGE breaking the law?",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",
      "\"Plaintiffs conclude that, upon information and belief, neither Lentini nor Erlich, nor anyone similarly situated who would represent the perspectives of federal employees (including national security employees), unions, or accountability and transparency advocates, will be selected for DOGE,\" the lawsuit claims.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is set to declare a national energy emergency on Day 1 of his return to power, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production. The order will focus on unlocking Alaska's resources as well as ending what a Trump White House official called \"the electric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday at noon EST, wants to increase domestic oil and gas production in order to bring down prices for U.S. consumers, the official said. Energy prices influence every part of the economy, ranging from the prices that consumers pay at the pump to the cost of items that require fossil fuels for production, the official noted.",

      "The president-elect is also planning on signing a memorandum on inflation, noting that higher prices were \"by design\" under the Biden administration, the official added.",
      "The national energy emergency will \"unlock a variety of different authorities\" that will enable the U.S. to quickly build again to produce more natural resources, create jobs and prosperity as well as strengthen national security, the incoming official said.",
      "Trump, who has long opposed clean energy and EV subsidies, has said the U.S. needs to increase traditional oil and gas production in order to reduce energy prices for Americans, a theme he reiterated in his inauguration speech on Monday.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "U.S. crude oil production reached a record last year, even as the Biden administration also directed billions in incentives to shift toward clean energy through tax credits for electric vehicles and home improvements to reduce energy usage.",
      "\"Within the unleashing American energy executive order, the president will put an end to the electric vehicle mandate,\" the incoming Trump official said. \"I'll also add that he'll put an end to efforts to curtail consumer choice on the things that consumers use every single day, whether it be shower heads, whether it be gas stoves, whether it be dishwashers and the like.\"",
      "The U.S. produced more than 13.4 million barrels a day in October 2024, or about 17% higher than when Trump ended his first term in January 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That marks the highest monthly domestic crude production going back to 1920, the agency's data shows.",
      "Energy companies stand to benefit from the new Trump administration's goal of expanding domestic fossil fuel production, said Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group.",
      "\"Companies involved in oil and gas exploration, extraction and infrastructure stand to gain as regulatory barriers are dismantled and investment in domestic production soars,\" he said in an email. \"Shares of U.S. energy giants and mid-cap firms are likely poised for significant upward momentum as the markets price in increased output and profitability.\"",
      "\"Global oil prices, already sensitive to geopolitical developments, could see sharp adjustments,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

    "summary": "U.S. officials have long feared that the widely popular short-form video app could be used as a vehicle for espionage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",

      "\"Taking control of your finances can absolutely help you feel more in control of your life overall, and that sense of control is incredibly important for mental well-being,\" Berwise said. \"A big part of financial stress comes from focusing on things we can't control \u2014 like rising prices or taxes.

      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",

      "What the Supreme Court said in its ruling on the TikTok ban",
      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",

      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community.

      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit on Friday accusing Walgreens of filling millions of unlawful opioid prescriptions.",
      "The civil suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Walgreen Boots Alliance, Walgreen Co. and its various subsidiaries   alleges the pharmacy giant knowingly filled millions of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances from approximately August 2012 through to the present. Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",
      "Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands \"behind our pharmacists, dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve, filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"",
      "\"We look forward to the opportunity to defend the professionalism and integrity of our pharmacists,\" the statement said.",
      "Last month the Justice Department\u00a0filed a similar lawsuit against CVS, alleging the pharmacy chain filled prescriptions with dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, agreed to fill opioid prescriptions early and made \"trinity prescriptions,\" which are a dangerous combination of drugs.",
      "Walgreens is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 pharmacies across the U.S. Walgreens plans to close hundreds of stores by the end of 2025 to turn around its flagging sales, and has already closed roughly 2,000 locations over the past decade, the company said.",

    "summary": "JSB and Perdue Farms agreed to settlements of $4 million each, while QSA, which employed 54 children, will pay $400,000.",
    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "Trump claims Biden lost track of over 300,000 migrant children. Here's a fact check.",
      "Trump claims Biden lost track of over 300,000 migrant children. Here's a fact check.",
      "\"You're just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it's okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\" said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",

      "Teen's death in Wisconsin sawmill highlights \"21st century problem\" across the U.S.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a\u00a0serious chemical burn\u00a0from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation's children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\" said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Dangerous conditions",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following\u00a0the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \"QSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\" he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\"",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\"The Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\" the Department said.",
      "Hundreds of ongoing investigations",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Trump administration officials are considering deploying as many as 10,000 soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border and using Department of Defense bases to hold migrants awaiting deportation as they plan their dramatic crackdown on illegal immigration, according to an internal government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an executive action Mr. Trump signed upon taking office on Monday, he declared a national emergency along the southern border and ordered the Defense Department to provide troops and resources \"to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control\" of the border. He also instructed the military to help build border barriers to repel migrants.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the president had signed another executive order to deploy 1,500 troops to the southern border, where 2,500 soldiers are already stationed under federal orders. Texas and other states have also deployed National Guard soldiers to the border in recent years, including to fortify it with razor wire.",
      "But the internal Customs and Border Protection memo dated Jan. 21 indicates there's a plan to dispatch \"~10,000 soldiers\" to help the agency's mission at the southern border. The Trump administration, according to the document, has submitted an \"[u]nrestrained request\" for the Pentagon to surge resources and personnel to assist CBP with technology and infrastructure.",
      "The memo also says the Defense Department \"may\" convert its bases into \"holding facilities,\" presumably to help CBP detain migrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally.",
      "Additionally, the memo shows the Trump administration is planning to dramatically expand detention capacity at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is expected to be at the center of Mr. Trump's promised mass deportations.",
      "According to the document, ICE officials want 14 new detention facilities with the capacity to hold up to 1,000 migrants each and another four able to accommodate as many as 10,000 immigrant detainees each.",
      "During a briefing with reporters, a senior U.S. military official said the 1,500-troop deployment would involve dispatching 1,000 Army personnel and 500 Marines, as well as helicopters, to the California and Texas border. The official said the troops would not engage in law enforcement, as federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. Instead, the official said they would be tasked with helping CBP and erecting border barriers, to curtail illegal crossings.",
      "The Department of Defense also announced it would \"provide military airlift to support\" deportation flights for more than 5,000 migrants detained along the U.S.-Mexico border by CBP. Officials said the Department of Homeland Security would offer in-flight law enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to greatly expand the role of the U.S. military in border enforcement \u2014 historically limited to operational and administrative duties \u2014 is part of a larger campaign to seal U.S. borders to migrants and asylum-seekers.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed U.S. immigration agents along the borders with Mexico and Canada to swiftly and summarily deport migrants crossing into the country illegally, denying them the opportunity to request asylum, according to CBP officials and internal documents.",
      "Those directions are being implemented in accordance with an unprecedented order issued by Mr. Trump that suspended the entry of unauthorized migrants into the country, based on the argument they are \"invading\" the U.S. and threatening public health and national security.",

      "While Mr. Trump made immigration a top issue in the campaign, his administration inherited a relatively calm southern border, with illegal crossings there at a four-year low. Unlawful crossings into the U.S. plunged in 2024 from the record highs in the previous three years due to a Mexican crackdown on migrants. They fell further after the Biden administration enacted restrictions on asylum last June.",

      "Washington \u2014 Citing President Trump's extraordinary move to close the American asylum system, U.S. border agents have been instructed to summarily deport migrants crossing into the country illegally without allowing them to request legal protection, according to internal government documents and agency officials.",
      "Just hours after being sworn in, Mr. Trump invoked sweeping presidential authorities to bar the entry of migrants deemed to be participating in an \"invasion\" of the U.S., as well as those who may pose a public health or national security risk. He cited a provision of immigration law known as 212(f) that allows presidents to suspend the entry of foreigners whose entry is deemed to be \"detrimental\" to the U.S.",
      "In that same proclamation, Mr. Trump cited his constitutional powers over foreign affairs to empower U.S. immigration officials to \"repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States.\"",
      "Internal government documents indicate that, as of Tuesday night, the president's \"full\" 212(f) authority was being implemented across Texas' border with Mexico, making nearly all migrants who arrive there subject to quick expulsion. The documents cite the public health-related 212(f) authority that applies to \"aliens that traveled through a country with a communicable disease.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's edict also applies to Border Patrol coastal sectors, including the one in Florida, and the U.S.-Canada border. The documents indicate Canadian authorities will be asked to accept those who cross the northern border illegally, beyond those asylum claimants the U.S. and Canada already exchange under a \"safe-third-country\" agreement.",
      "Two Customs and Border Protection officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal guidance, said migrants will not be allowed to see an immigration judge or asylum officer under Mr. Trump's edict, which effectively suspends U.S. obligations under domestic and international law to ensure people fleeing persecution are not returned to danger.",
      "One of the officials said Border Patrol agents were directed to swiftly deport migrant adults and families traveling with children under the president's directives, after taking their biometrics and fingerprints. Migrants who are not from Mexico are to be detained pending their deportation.",
      "Those with criminal histories are subject to prosecution in the U.S. under a long-standing practice, the official said.",
      "Releases of migrants into the U.S. have been largely prohibited. The internal government documents say requests to release migrants with a court notice will need to be approved by Border Patrol headquarters and will only be considered in \"life-threatening\" situations.",
      "The official said the new policy mirrors Title 42, a far-reaching order the first Trump administration enacted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic to expel most migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally. The order, based on a contested public health rationale that migrants would spread COVID-19, was eventually discontinued by the Biden administration, which relied on the measure for more than two years amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "The Biden administration enacted its own asylum restriction last June, also citing the 212(f) authorities. While that order disqualified most migrants crossing the southern border illegally from asylum, it still gave them the opportunity to plead their case before asylum officers if they expressed fear of being harmed once deported.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's asylum restrictions also had a major exemption: they did not apply to migrants waiting in Mexico who used a government smartphone app, known as CBP One, to request a time to enter the U.S. at an official border entry point.",
      "But immediately after Mr. Trump's inauguration, his administration shut down the CBP One process and canceled all existing appointments under the app, which had been allowing up to 1,500 migrants to enter the U.S. each day.",
      "While the Biden administration faced record numbers of migrant arrivals in its first three years, illegal border crossing dropped sharply in 2024 after the Mexican government ramped up efforts to interdict those traveling to the U.S. Unlawful crossings fell further after Biden's own asylum crackdown in June, and remain at a four-year low.",
      "Mr. Trump's moves at the border, like his unprecedented attempt to upend birthright citizenship, are likely to face legal challenges.",
      "\"Put simply, this order ends asylum at the United States border for anyone fleeing danger, even for families persecuted on the basis of their religion or political speech,\" said Lee Gelernt, who leads the American Civil Liberties Union's immigration lawsuits.",

    "summary": "Stewart Rhodes was serving an 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy when he was freed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the far-right group the Oath Keepers, visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday, days after his lengthy prison sentence was commuted by President Trump.",
      "Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison in May 2023 for seditious conspiracy in one of the longest sentences for crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was among the more than 1,500 defendants who were granted clemency on Monday, hours after Mr. Trump took office. Rhodes was released from federal custody on Tuesday, according to his lawyer.",
      "Speaking in a House office building Wednesday, Rhodes told reporters he was there to meet with House Republicans and advocate for a pardon for James Brown, a fellow Oath Keeper who was convicted of weapons charges in a separate federal case. Rhodes said he was not invited by any member of Congress and had not stepped foot in the Capitol.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Rhodes and his fellow Oath Keepers planned for violence ahead of the Capitol attack and celebrated their actions in the aftermath.",
      "Before Rhodes' sentencing, prosecutors said he \"pushed the idea among Oath Keepers members and others that with a large enough mob, they could intimidate Congress and its members and impose the conspirators' will rather than the American people's: to stop the certification of the next President of the United States.\"",
      "They added that Rhodes has called for \"violent opposition to the authority of the government of the United States for well over a decade\" and \"continues to advocate for political violence.\"",
      "In a recording four days after Jan. 6 that was played at his trial, Rhodes said his \"only regret is they should have brought rifles\" and that he would \"hang f****** Pelosi from the lamppost.\" Rhodes said Wednesday he regretted that comment, and that he was \"drunk and pissed off.\"",
      "Many Republicans have downplayed the pardons and commutations or have avoided answering questions on the topic, saying they have yet to take look at Mr. Trump's decision.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:04:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have asked federal judges in Washington to dismiss pending indictments against defendants charged as a result of conduct on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's order issuing sweeping pardons to defendants convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol has been met with sharp condemnations from federal judges in Washington, D.C., who presided over the cases and are now dismissing charges at the request of federal prosecutors in the new administration.",
      "The judges publicly voiced their discontent in a trio of separate orders issued Wednesday, two days after Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants and ordered any pending prosecutions to be dismissed just hours after he was sworn into office for a second term.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's order, prosecutors in Washington have been seeking to end ongoing cases. The Justice Department said earlier this month that there were roughly 300 pending cases related to the Capitol assault. Nearly 60% of those defendants were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder, which are felonies, it said.",
      "Citing the years spent reviewing evidence and adjudicating hundreds of cases involving defendants charged with violent and nonviolent criminal offenses, the judges rebuked efforts to downplay the events of Jan. 6.",
      "One order issued by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw the election interference case against Mr. Trump that was dismissed after his election in November, states that \"no pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "\"In hundreds of cases like this one over the past four years, judges in this district have administered justice without fear or favor,\" Chutkan wrote. \"The historical record established by those proceedings must stand, unmoved by political winds, as a testament and as a warning.\"",
      "The dismissal of the case, she said, \"cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"",
      "Chutkan's order came in the case against John Banuelos, an Illinois man who was arrested in March and faced five charges, including obstruction of law enforcement and entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors said he was seen on security footage in a crowd of rioters who breached a police line on the Capitol grounds, and court documents allegedly show an image of Banuelos with what appears to be a firearm in the waistband of his pants. Security footage from the attack later appears to show him scaling scaffolding around the inaugural stage, pulling the gun from his waistband and firing two shots in the air, prosecutors said. Banuelos pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "Another order from U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell rebuffs Mr. Trump's claim that the Jan. 6 prosecutions represented a \"grave national injustice\" and that clemency would begin a \"process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "\"No 'national injustice' occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,\" Howell wrote, quoting Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"No 'process of national reconciliation' can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity. That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law.\"",
      "The judge said she had presided over \"scores\" of cases involving defendants charged for their conduct outside and inside the Capitol building and said charges were \"fully supported\" by videos, photos, admissions by defendants themselves during plea hearings and the testimony of law enforcement and congressional staff who were at the Capitol.",
      "\"[T]his court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that the cases reflect the work of prosecutors, law enforcement officers and defense attorneys \"to defend our democracy and rights and preserve our long tradition of peaceful transfers of power \u2014 which, until January 6, 2021, served as a model to the world \u2014 all while affording those charged every protection guaranteed by our Constitution and the criminal justice system.\"",
      "Howell was granting the government's request to dismiss a nine-count superseding indictment against Nicholas DeCarlo and Nicholas Ochs, who had earlier entered into plea deals and admitted to throwing smoke bombs at police officers and property damage and theft.",
      "Ochs founded the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, according to court documents. The two entered the Capitol and smoked cigarettes in the Crypt \u2014 which is located just below the Rotunda \u2014 filings show, and DeCarlo shouted \"Where's Nancy?\" a reference to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as they made their way through the building.",
      "A third order from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the government's request to toss out an indictment charging Dominic Box with seven felony and misdemeanor counts. He was found guilty of six counts last year, including civil disorder and disorderly conduct. Kollar-Kotelly wrote that Box was among the first group of rioters who entered the Capitol building on Jan. 6 and went on to overrun police officers in the Crypt.",
      "He was set to be sentenced on Feb. 21.",
      "Like her colleagues on the district court, Kollar-Kotelly said the events of Jan. 6 are preserved through videos, trial transcripts, jury verdicts and judicial opinions analyzing the evidence.",
      "\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies,\" she wrote.",
      "Dismissal of charges, pardons and commutations of sentences, the judge said, \"will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "Kollar-Kotelly also praised the Capitol Police and local law enforcement who responded to the attack at the Capitol to protect lawmakers and staff, the vice president and his family, and the Capitol building.",
      "\"For hours, those officers were aggressively confronted and violently assaulted. More than 140 officers were injured. Others tragically passed away as a result of the events of that day,\" she wrote. \"But law enforcement did not falter. Standing with bear spray streaming down their faces, those officers carried out their duty to protect.\"",
      "Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump had vowed to issue pardons to Jan. 6 defendants, who he has called \"hostages\" and political prisoners.\" But the scope of the pardons came as a surprise to some, as they were \"full, complete and unconditional.\"",
      "The president also commuted the sentences of 14 defendants, including high-ranking members of the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Some, like Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, were serving sentences after they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes.",
      "Howell and Chutkan were nominated to the court by former President Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Kollar-Kotelly was selected by former President Bill Clinton and has served since 1997.",

      "As commerce secretary, Lutnick, if confirmed, would be in charge of a sprawling Cabinet agency that is involved in funding new computer chip factories, imposing trade restrictions, releasing economic data and monitoring the weather. It is also a position in which connections to CEOs and the wider business community are crucial.",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \"tariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" During his campaign, Mr. Trump proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports.

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House approved the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday, signing off on the Senate's changes to the legislation aimed at expanding the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "The House passed the legislation in a 263 to 156 vote. It now heads to President Trump's desk, where it's expected to be the first piece of legislation he signs in his new term.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. It would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. The legislation also includes a provision that empowers state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "\"This legislation would simply say that we have to detain some of the worst people that are here illegally,\" Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said on the House floor Wednesday.",
      "Some Democrats spent floor debate ahead of the vote focused on the pardons Mr. Trump granted to people convicted for their actions related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, arguing it was hypocritical for Republicans who supported the pardons to push this bill.",
      "\"These are the people who want you to believe, want us to believe, that they are keeping violent criminals off the streets,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said.",
      "The House approved a version of the legislation earlier this month in a 264 to 159 vote, with 48 Democrats joining Republicans. It then went to the Senate, where an amended version passed with bipartisan support on Monday.",
      "The Senate's changes expanded the legislation's scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. Democrats had also hoped to further amend the legislation, seeking to protect DACA recipients and eliminate the provision that empowers state attorneys general, among other things. Still, 12 Senate Democrats ultimately backed the legislation, propelling it to passage.",

    "summary": "No president has ever exercised this constitutional power, but \"this remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,\" one source said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is threatening to use his powers to adjourn Congress so he can make recess appointments for at least some of his top Cabinet nominees and their deputies, enabling them to begin running the largest federal departments.",
      "Mr. Trump most recently raised the prospect of plunging the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory during his White House meeting Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, mulling the option if Democrats opt to slow-walk or delay his top national security and public health nominees, according to two people familiar with the meetings.",
      "\"This remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,\" one of the people familiar with the meetings said, emphasizing this is not expected to happen this week, but remains under active consideration.",
      "Mr. Trump has signaled he wants the Senate to move quickly to confirm his top Cabinet picks, and Republican senators have said for weeks they want to move swiftly, particularly on his top national security appointments. On Monday night, the Senate unanimously confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but votes on John Ratcliffe to serve as CIA director, Pete Hegseth to serve as defense secretary, and Kristi Noem to serve as homeland security secretary, are still in the queue for consideration.",
      "Procedural issues are delaying those votes, with Democrats slowing consideration of Ratcliffe and Republicans warning they'll hold a final up-or-down vote on him over the weekend, if necessary.",
      "It is unclear how long Mr. Trump would recess Congress, given that a possible government shutdown looms in mid-March and Republican leaders have set an April goal of passing massive economic, tax and immigration legislation that would authorize Mr. Trump's plans to cut inflation and taxes and dramatically overhaul border security policy.",
      "How can Trump adjourn Congress?",
      "The second clause of Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution gives the president the power to convene the House and Senate in certain cases. While presidents over the course of U.S. history have frequently summoned both chambers for special sessions, or the Senate to vote on key nominees or treaties, no president has ever exercised his constitutional power to adjourn the two chambers.",
      "The lack of precedent means any Trump decision to adjourn the Senate would likely face immediate legal challenge ultimately resulting in appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Here's one example of how it would work: The House is scheduled to leave Washington for up to 10 days starting Friday, so the two parties can hold their annual policy retreats. The GOP-controlled House could pass a resolution formally adjourning for that length of time and send the resolution to the Senate. The upper chamber, where at least 60 votes would be needed to consider a consent resolution, would either also adjourn or fail to agree to do so. Under the Constitution, both houses of Congress must agree to adjourn for more than three days. If the Senate does not agree, the president could try using his adjournment power to send the Senate home, launching the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory.",
      "Talk about flexing this never-used power dates back to the last year of the first Trump presidency, when Democrats were blocking hundreds of executive and judicial nominees. Conservative activists began pushing the White House to consider the adjournment powers, something Mr. Trump never used. Now, emboldened by his second victory and far more familiar with the powers of the presidency, Mr. Trump is actively discussing the option.",
      "The president raised the prospect of recess appointments in an advisory way to Thune on Tuesday, the sources said, who would prefer that Mr. Trump avoid this move to preserve and protect institutional prerogatives. On Tuesday after the Mr. Trump meeting, the Senate majority leader expressed public skepticism and said any move by Mr. Trump to adjourn Congress should be blamed on Democrats.",
      "\"I think we're going to find out here pretty quickly whether or not the Democrats want to help us get through some of these nominations in a way that gets us back on track with the way it was done prior to the last two presidencies,\" he said.",
      "Both parties have spent much of the 21st century using what had been obscure procedural tactics to delay or slowly derail presidential nominees for Cabinet posts, regulatory agency boards and federal judgeships.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "Any president can appoint someone to a position requiring Senate confirmation whenever the chamber is in recess. Back when the country began and traveling to and from Washington by horse or train took far longer, recess appointments were a far more urgent need. Now, with Congress able to function year-round, it's more of a political tactic.",
      "Any nominees appointed to a position during a congressional recess must be confirmed by the end of the next calendar year, meaning if Mr. Trump were to make recess appointments early this year, they could serve in their roles until December 2026. Once a new congressional session begins, a president can renominate recess appointees for Senate confirmation \u2014 or issue a fresh recess appointment for them.",
      "The biggest legal test of the power came in 2014, when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled President Obama had violated the recess appointments clause by naming three picks to the National Labor Relations Board in 2012. The justices said the Senate was not actually in a formal recess when Obama acted.",

      "\"The U.S. Attorney's Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution,\" he added.",
      "Bove, a longtime federal prosecutor who served on President Trump's criminal defense team before joining the department, also directed the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces to \"assist in the execution of President Trump's immigration-related initiatives.\" The task forces are groups of law enforcement and intelligence officers based in cities across the country who typically investigate terrorism threats. An executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Monday initiated a process by which certain cartels could be recognized as foreign terrorist organizations by the U.S.",
      "The three-page directive also said the Justice Department's law enforcement components, including the FBI and DEA, should identify any evidence related to noncitizens in the U.S. within 60 days and pass that information along to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The memo said cartels, violent crime and the fentanyl crisis are \"three of the most serious threats facing the American people\" and ordered that, consistent with an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this week, \"the Justice Department must, and will, work to eradicate these threats.\"",
      "Bove's message emphasized that state or local officials who seek to obstruct or refuse to comply with federal immigration law enforcement efforts risked investigation and potential prosecution.",
      "The memo also directed all federal prosecutors to charge \"the most serious, readily provable offenses\" in any case, returning to a department policy enforced most recently during Mr. Trump's first term in office. He rescinded Biden-era policies that offered prosecutors more discretion in their charging decisions and could lead to lesser charges or less severe penalties.",

      "\"The Justice Department's responsibility, proudly shouldered by each of its employees, includes aggressive enforcement of laws enacted by Congress, as well as vigorous defense of the President's actions on behalf of the United States against legal challenges,\" Bove wrote.",

      "\"The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost U.S. taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023,\" DOGE wrote. \"The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.\"",
      "In pointing out the penny's costliness, DOGE is taking aim at an issue that has sparked debate for years, although the price of manufacturing the cent has only grown over the past several years. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. was spending about 1.5 cents to mint each penny, or less than half of its current manufacturing cost.",
      "Still, the cent's $179 million in costs represents mere metaphorical pennies when it comes to DOGE's mandate to cut federal spending.

      "Federal officials have proposed suspending the penny in prior years, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pushing the idea in 2015. Some economists have also advocated for dropping the penny from circulation, but there could be a costly downside to ditching the cent, as transactions would be rounded to 5-cent intervals, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a 2020 blog post.",
      "\"For a single item or small-value purchase, rounding up or down could represent a significant price change,\" the post noted.",
      "Other nations have ditched their equivalent of the penny, including Canada, which stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. One 2018 economic analysis found that Canadian consumers paid about $3.27 million in additional Canadian dollars at grocery stores each year due to prices being rounded higher after the change.",
      "\"On the other hand, there may be additional, hard-to-quantify costs to using pennies that would argue in favor of elimination. Counting pennies to make change takes time, and as the old business adage goes, time is money,\" the Richmond Fed noted.",

      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media site, that he had spoken to Ulbricht's mother on his first full day in office.",
      "\"It was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\" he wrote. \"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\"",
      "He called Ulbricht's prison sentence \"ridiculous.\"",
      "During the campaign, he had promised to help Ulbricht in a speech at the Libertarian Party National Convention last May.",
      "Libertarian activists, who generally oppose criminal drug policies, have long believed that government investigators overreached in building their case against Silk Road. Many held \"Free Ross\" signs.",
      "The Silk Road site was set up by Ulbricht in 2011 on the dark web, a part of the internet that's inaccessible to traditional search engines. It did not accept cash or credit cards; users had to pay with cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin. All transactions were encrypted and hence untraceable.",
      "It became a place for people to buy and sell illicit drugs, weapons, poisons, and services such as computer hacking.",
      "\"Silk Road was the Amazon of drug sites,\" former FBI Special Agent Milan Patel said in an interview for the CBS News series \"FBI Declassified.\"",
      "\"We saw murder-for-hire postings, hacking-for-hire postings, which was, 'hey, pay me two bitcoin and I'll hack into your ex-wife or ex-husband's email account,'\" Patel said. \"\u2026It was totally anonymous. And you could never trace it back to the person who asked for it.\"",
      "Ulbricht ran the site until his arrest in 2013, when it was seized by the FBI. During his trial, prosecutors said at least six deaths were traced to overdoses from drugs bought on Silk Road. They alleged that Ulbricht collected $18 million through commissions on tens of thousands of drug sales, and presented evidence alleging he sought to have people killed for threatening his business.",
      "Since Mr. Trump assumed office, he has also pardoned about 1,500 defendants convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 08:56:44 -0500",
    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe must \"wake up\" and spend more on its defense as Trump returns, but how realistic is the suggestion?",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump cemented his return to the White House, French President Emmanuel Macron told his European counterparts\u00a0this week to \"wake up\" and spend more on the continent's defense to reduce the continent's reliance on the United States for security.",
      "\"What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?\" Macron said Monday, addressing members of the French military.",
      "President Trump has often criticized America's NATO allies for failing to meet domestic defense spending targets. At a February 2024 campaign rally in South Carolina, he said he'd encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies who don't meet the target.",
      "In the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump repeated a demand he first made in January that NATO \"needs to pay 5%.\" Under a 2014 agreement made by the group, the alliance's more than 30 member states committed to aim to spend at least 2% of the value of their domestic economies on defense every year. During his first term in office, Mr. Trump pressured America's allies to meet that threshold, and some have increased their military spending since that time, but many still do not make the 2% bar.",
      "In his remarks just two days after the U.S. election in November, Macron called on Europeans \"to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy\" and to decrease reliance on U.S. military hardware and defense leadership.",
      "CBS News has spoken with analysts and former officials from several European countries and NATO following the U.S. election. The experts, from Poland, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and the NATO alliance itself, vary in their assessments of the feasibility of Macron's broad vision, but they largely agree that Europe can and should cooperate more closely and spend more money on defense.",
      "The direct quotes below have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Poland - Professor Katarzyna Pisarska",
      "Chair, Warsaw Security Forum",
      "Speaking on Macron's comments:",
      "You have to remember that Macron's vision is not really a detail-oriented, ready-to-go project. It is an idea that has been discussed in Europe, and throughout the last two years, but the general direction is that we are not building anything that would be competitive to NATO. Rather, we would be creating capabilities, especially defense capabilities, that would help and strengthen the European defense pillar of NATO.",
      "The idea that we would go alone without the United States has been rejected by almost all, if not all, EU and NATO member states.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "Poland currently buys 80% of all its military stocks from the United States. It's heavily dependent on American air missile defense systems. These are not things that you can detangle or unbundle from overnight. So the majority of countries \u2014 especially from the NATO eastern flank \u2014 will tell you we will absolutely not go alone without the United States. There is no way that France, and even less so Germany, can step up to deliver the type of technological capabilities that are needed to substitute for the Americans on the ground here in Europe.",
      "Discussion has moved in the direction that it has been moving pre-Trump election: Europe has to step up with NATO, start producing more, start spending more, also developing its own capabilities. We also need to have a number of different defense elements that we procure and create by ourselves, and that should be also understandable to our American partners, although when I spoke with congressmen in April, not all of them understood that it is okay for Europeans to spend money on European equipment and not only on American or Korean equipment.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "Maybe President Emmanuel Macron has some idea since [the U.S. election] that he can yet again push the idea that European strategic autonomy is really complete independent from the United States. But I will say it again: From countries that are on the forefront of this war [in Ukraine], for countries that will have to be the first battleground of this war, which is the NATO eastern flank, that is not negotiable.",
      "We will have to do more and we will be doing more. I think what is unclear in the United States is that Europe already delivers 50% of military aid to Ukraine and 90% of financial and refugee aid to Ukraine. So stepping up has already happened to a large extent.",
      "It has to happen more. We need to have more troops. We have to be prepared to defend ourselves, but having America as an ally, not a competitor, I think this is what is very important to understand.",
      "U.K. - Alistair Burt",
      "Former Member of U.K. Parliament and minister of state for the Middle East at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and minister of state at the Department for International Development",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "We have known for some time that the United States, under whatever leadership, would be asking Europeans to spend more on their defense, and what Trump's election has done has catalyzed that now. I think you have to take people at their word, and what Trump has said about NATO in the past and what people have said about European defense, rings true. I think he's [Macron] making the point that in the end, it's up to us. You're either a supplicant or you're making the weather. And there's no reason why we should just roll over and take the world as President Trump is going to try and define it. It will still, I'm absolutely certain, be in the interests of the West to act together, but we cannot take that for granted any longer, and I think Macron is right to seize upon it.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "I noticed that Macron's speech sort of offered the invitation to those outside the EU to be part of this wider European political community that the United Kingdom has made very clear it intends to be part of. I think the United Kingdom does have a role to play in this. Clearly our military is a very important part of NATO and will always be, but I would very much believe it is in the United Kingdom's interest to act with the wider European community. It bolsters them, strengthens them, and it's in our own interests. We at least have begun to spend more on defense. Other states will have more catching up to do but I do see it in the U.K.'s political and economic and military interests to be active in relation to what Macron has been saying.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "All the rhetoric has been absolutely right, we cannot afford to let Russia win. You have the Baltic states very anxious, you have [countries] with Russian enclaves that could allow Putin to say, there are Russian people here, so we will defend their interests just as we purported to do in Ukraine. How would [those countries] feel if there was some sense that Ukraine was not being supported?",
      "On the other hand, if you take out the United States' economic and military support that is asking a great deal of the rest of us to make up. I think the rhetoric is very, very clear, in that everybody has said we will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, and there can't be any weakening in that. The moment you've got any possibility of that weakening, then you're effectively giving the game away.",
      "If there is to be some sort of U.S.-brokered negotiation [for Ukraine], clearly [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy wants to be in the strongest possible position. And to do that, he's got to be able to enter those negotiations with the clear determination of the rest of Europe behind him to say whatever happens, we won't let you down, but if it goes on for two, four, five years, who knows?",
      "I don't think Europe can say anything other than what it's saying, and again, I think you have to take us at our word.",
      "NATO - Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff",
      "Former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "Let's nail this for once and for all: There is one effective military alliance in Europe - a political-military alliance in Europe, in the trans-Atlantic region \u2014 and it's called NATO. NATO has a command structure. It has a doctrine. It practices regularly. It is used to moving and commanding military forces at real scale. What is the point of trying to create something where we've got 70 years, 75 years of experience with NATO? Now, of course, the problem is, what happens if America, under Trump, either pulls out of NATO, which is unlikely, or reduces its support to NATO, which is possible?",
      "The solution to that, frankly, is not to start blathering on about new formations under the European Union. It's to lean into NATO and damn well start spending money. Why is Trump and why are America likely to pull a rug from under NATO, if they do? Because the French, the Germans, the British, the Spanish, the Italians, have simply not pulled their weight in defense spending terms for most of the 75 years of NATO's existence, or certainly, at least the last, certainly the last 30 years. So, lean into NATO and really double down on NATO and double down on defense spending.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "There is one good thing, though, that the European Union can do, which is defense industries. If they can get a grip of European defense procurement in order to offset the current dependence on the Americans in order to standardize weaponry. It is ridiculous for the British to continue with its own cottage industry of making tanks, when actually the rest of Europe buys Leopard IIs, which is a perfectly good tank, from Rheinmetall [in Germany].",
      "This is going to require some real political boldness, and it is going to require a pooling and a sharing of sovereignty. It's going to require individual nations like Britain to say, okay, we're not going to make a tank. We'll buy the Leopard II.",
      "On NATO:",
      "If you start building large numbers of European [non-NATO] headquarters, they've got to come from somewhere - a European command structure. What it means is that NATO will suffer. You know, I was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, one of many Brits that go back to Montgomery. The Germans have the Chief of Staff. The Chairman of the Military Committee is a Dutchman at the moment, and he or she rotates the commanders of the joint force commands. Europe has a leading role in NATO. Europeans have leading roles in NATO. But it all comes down to really leaning in and being able to produce the troop numbers, the ships, the planes, that NATO needs to really provide an effective deterrence.",
      "Germany - Norbert Roetgen",
      "Former Chair, Bundestag (German parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "I think this definitely now is the hour of Europe, a European moment, when we have to prepare that, quite probably, America, under the Trump presidency, will stop any financial or military support for Ukraine. But perhaps we also are going to see the attempt to strike a deal between Trump and Putin, so this now means that European security definitely has to become European. So either we stand up or we give up.",
      "However, I think we, the Europeans, are not prepared, despite all the evidence that this had to be expected. Europeans are not prepared, so we have to quickly catch up. It's possible, and the political will is what is lacking most, but we will have to act in a very pragmatic way.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "We have to act in a very pragmatic way to quickly and more substantially support Ukraine, and this means that we have to compensate for the American support in terms of weapons and ammunition delivery and, in the short term, this would mean that the Europeans would have to buy weapons and ammunition on the international market, and in the mid- and longer term we will have to enhance our capabilities to better coordinate, to create bigger markets in order to scale our economies in the area of defense.",
      "Up to now, there is no sufficient political will to do what is necessary to support Ukraine in order to enable Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression. Otherwise, the military situation on the battleground would be different. We are going to see that the United States is not contributing as they have done in the past, so there is a lack of political will, and there is only one way to change this course, and this is by doing more.",
      "This would mean that all European member states like Poland, Germany and France come together and invite other countries; for example, Britain\u2014 we should go beyond the EU because it's about the entire European architecture of security\u2014 come together. And when they come together, they should bring with them substantial additional contributions in terms of money and in terms of weapons and ammunition, and this should be done in the short term. And then they should devise a plan on how to make this a structured effort and what is necessary to be done to better coordinate, to enhance the support necessary for the defense of Ukraine. It should be done very substantially in terms of money and weapons. There are no further words needed. What is needed are deeds.",
      "On NATO:",
      "Of course, it's in the European strategic interest to be a strong part of NATO, to keep the Americans in Europe. This is not against anybody, but it is only to contribute in a stronger way to what is at the heart and what is the core of NATO, and that is European security.",
      "Italy - Natalie Tocci",
      "Director, Istituto Affari Internazionali, and former special adviser to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "He's been saying this for a long time, and in a sense the vision was right back then, and it's even more right now. He started talking about European strategic autonomy in 2017, and there wasn't a lot of appetite and traction behind the idea, given that it has traditionally been mistakenly interpreted as something that runs counter to the transatlantic relationship. So obviously now with Trump, a good idea that was good back then becomes politically relevant today.",
      "From the general concept of the idea to the action, there's a big gap, and he hasn't put forward any new concrete ideas in that respect.",
      "Generally what tends to happen is Macron says something, everyone else criticizes him, but no one really puts forward an alternative vision. So God bless Macron for at least kind of having an idea, and I think in this particular case it's even a good idea, and I do think that the election of Donald Trump is going to galvanize some action, but I'm very skeptical that the kind of action that is going to be insufficient relative to what we have to do.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "We're basically talking about 100 billion euros a year ($104 billion) for several years alongside all member states beginning to spend between 2-and-4% of GDP. This is not going to happen overnight.",
      "There's no antagonism between the EU and NATO, because, frankly speaking, as we're in the midst of a war, we can't really afford to have sort of academic conversations about the EU and NATO. What the EU can contribute is on providing the regulatory and financial incentives for Europeans to do more on defense together.",
      "However, I think there is a lot there to be worked on, and especially if some of these countries begin or increasingly pursue projects collectively. If you think about France, Italy on air defense, think about the Italian-German project on a new tank, there's a lot there that can be worked on.",
      "Does it mean that Europeans would have all defense capacities? Probably not, or certainly not in the short term, so there's still a lot of dependence on the US and US defense industry.",
      "This is not a question of just completely being self-reliant on your own defense industry, but certainly there's a lot more the European defense industry can do and a lot more that governments can do to support that consolidation and cooperation within the defense industry in Europe.",

    "summary": "President Trump campaigned on the promise to bring down the U.S. cost of living. That could be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" on Monday signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order blames several factors for the pandemic-era inflation surge that has left many households feeling financially pinched, including high federal spending under the Biden administration and costs from new regulations.",
      "\"It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,\" the executive order states.",
      "To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel.",
      "There's a lot riding on Mr. Trump's mandate given that U.S. voters last fall consistently ranked the economy and inflation as among their top issues. But whether Mr. Trump's order will meaningfully move the needle on inflation is uncertain, some economists say.",
      "\"Trump's cost of living order fails to address the root causes of inflation, namely corporate profiteering and broken supply chains,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank. \"This order is a talking point, not a plan.\"",
      "Recent economic\u00a0research from the likes of Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has found that spiking prices in 2021 and 2022 stemmed from factors such as supply-chain disruptions and increased commodity prices \u2014 forces that any president, including Mr. Trump, would struggle to control.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In the meantime, inflation has cooled dramatically since reaching a 40-year high in June 2022, although the consumer price index remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate. While prices are rising more slowly, more than 4 in 10 Americans express pessimism about their own economic prospects over the next year due to the ongoing impact of inflation, Bankrate found in a December survey.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan: Deregulation, cheaper housing and more",
      "Mr. Trump's order targeting prices highlights several areas for federal departments to focus on, including reducing the number of federal regulations that Trump administration officials argue has driven up the cost of living for American families.",
      "\"In sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,\" the order states.",
      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",

      "\"My concern is the message that it sends when people who are arrested for committing violence against police officers are not held to account,\" he said. \"And I worry about the morale of my officers. I worry about just how this impacts them, and I don't want them handling some protest or making some arrest in the future and scratching their head wondering, 'Well, I wonder what's going to happen with this case?'\"",
      "He said many officers have expressed anger about the pardons.",
      "\"They're upset, and I don't blame them,\" Manger said.",

      "More than 140 officers from Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department were assaulted during the riot, according to the Justice Department. Over 170 defendants were charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer during the siege that interrupted Congress as it was certifying Biden's 2020 election victory over Mr. Trump.",
      "Manger said he's \"always worried\" about the safety of his officers, but risks and threats come with the job.",

      "Manger also said Biden's commutation of the life sentence of Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier \"sends a pretty poor message\" to the FBI and all law enforcement. Peltier was convicted in the 1975 killing of two FBI agents.",

      "\"We conclude that the district court correctly held that Colorado's habeas statute only applies to persons, and not to nonhuman animals, no matter how cognitively, psychologically, or socially sophisticated they may be,\" State Supreme Court Justice Maria Berkenkotter wrote in her ruling.",
      "The zoo called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" in a statement, saying \"while we're happy with this outcome, we are disappointed that it ever came to this.\"",
      "\"For the past 19 months, we've been subjected to their misrepresented attacks, and we've wasted valuable time and money responding to them in courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the zoo's statement continued.",
      "The Nonhuman Rights Project expressed disappointment and hinted at the possibility of an attempt to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying Tuesday's ruling \"perpetuates a clear injustice, stating that unless an individual is human they have no right to liberty.\"",
      "The group said the zoo's five elephants will continue to suffer unless and until a court steps in.",
      "\"Future courts will reject this notion, as judges in the United States and around the world have already begun to do,\" the group's statement\u00a0continued. \"As with other social justice movements, early losses are expected as we challenge an entrenched status quo that has allowed Missy, Kimba, Lucky, LouLou, and Jambo to be relegated to a lifetime of mental and physical suffering. We'll share further analysis of this opinion as well as our next steps in the coming days.\"",
      "The district court did note, however, that the elephants likely were exposed to poor conditions and inadequately sized enclosures, but said the Nonhuman Rights Project simply has no standing under the law cited in its lawsuit.",
      "\"The district court granted the Zoo's motion to dismiss,\" Berkenkotter wrote in her ruling. \"As required in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court accepted the allegations in NRP's Petition as true, including its assertion that elephants cannot function normally in captivity. Addressing NRP's argument that the common law has historically been used to extend the writ of habeas corpus, the court noted that no U.S. court has extended the right to nonhuman animals and, regardless, that the right to habeas corpus in Colorado is a creature of statute.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday dramatically broadened the scope of expedited deportations, enacting a nationwide expansion of an immigration policy known as \"expedited removal\" that was previously limited to areas close to U.S. borders.",
      "Expedited removal allows U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants who lack proper documents through a streamlined process that bypasses the lengthy and massively backlogged immigration court system. If those identified for expedited removal do not request asylum or fail to establish they may have a legitimate asylum case, they can be expeditiously deported, without an opportunity to see an immigration judge.",
      "Before Tuesday's change, federal immigration officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Now, these expedited deportations will apply to unauthorized immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who can't prove they have been in the country for more than two years. The move by the Department of Homeland Security revived a first Trump administration policy that the Biden administration had discontinued. It took effect at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday.",
      "In less than 48 hours since returning to the Oval Office, President Trump has already taken a flurry of actions, some of them unprecedented in nature, to launch a multi-faced crackdown on immigration.",
      "Mr. Trump shut down access to the U.S. asylum system using extraordinary presidential powers; declared a national emergency to dispatch more troops to the southern border; froze the refugee admissions programs; and directed federal agencies to deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally or on temporary visas. The latter action has already triggered lawsuits from Democratic-led states and pro-immigrant groups.",
      "The president has also laid the foundations for his promised mass deportations, directing federal officials to expand immigration detention facilities and allow local law enforcement authorities to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants. His administration rescinded Biden-era guidelines that barred deportation officers from making arrests at so-called \"sensitive locations,\" which include schools and churches.",
      "Democratic-led cities with \"sanctuary\" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have been bracing for an increase in federal operations targeting unauthorized immigrants in their communities.",
      "Trump administration officials have said that while those with criminal histories will be prioritized for arrest, unauthorized immigrants with clean records are also at risk of being detained \u2014 a major shift from Biden administration policy.",

    "summary": "The executive order means Americans won't be able to select \"X\" on passports any longer.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0declaring that it's policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female,\" reversing the ability of Americans to mark \"other\" or \"X\" on federal forms and causing sweeping implications in the way the federal government acknowledges gender.",
      "Mr. Trump has long pledged to alter the way the federal government handles the issue of gender identification, and on the campaign trail, his lines about preventing transgender athletes from participating in women's sports prompted some of the loudest reactions from his rally-goers.",
      "LGBTQ rights groups are pledging to challenge Trump's order where they can.",
      "\"Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women's domestic abuse shelters to women's workplace showers,\" Mr. Trump's executive order reads. \"This is wrong.\"",
      "The order is at odds with the statements of transgender Americans, who say they are trying to use spaces that align with their gender identity, not \"gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.\"",
      "The president's executive order means the secretaries of the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management will require that government-issued identification documents, including visas, passports, and Global Entry cards, \"accurately reflect the holder's sex.\" Americans have been able to select \"X\" on their passports\u00a0since April 2022\u00a0under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The gender executive order also says the federal government is not to use terms like gender identity, instead using the sex assigned at birth.",
      "\"Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology,\" the order reads. \"Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\"",
      "According to the LGBTQ media advocacy group GLAAD, \"gender ideology is not a term transgender people use to describe themselves, it is an inaccurate term deployed by opponents to undermine and dehumanize transgender and nonbinary people.\"",
      "The order also says the attorney general \"shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons revises its policies concerning medical care to be consistent with this order, and shall ensure that no federal funds are expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.\"",
      "Legally speaking, Thomas Berry, director at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said the executive order is wide-ranging, but aspects of it may run up against a 2020 Supreme Court decision. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 vote that it is\u00a0illegal for an employer to fire someone because they are gay or transgender.",
      "\"It's such wide-ranging executive order,\" Berry said of Mr. Trump's action. \"I think some he has the authority to do and some parts of it are going to be more controversial. So one thing that strikes me immediately that I'm curious about is to what extent is he going to try to push back against the Supreme Court's Bostock decision from within the last five years, where the Supreme Court explicitly held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to both sexual orientation as well as gender identity, and discrimination on the basis of gender identity. So that's \u2014 that's a statute, the interpretation of which is up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has made a binding decision.\"",
      "Berry said the federal government will likely have more latitude in how it applies the order internally within the federal government, such as how federal employees may identify.",
      "Supporters of LGBTQ   rights have vowed to fight the Trump administration's changes however they can.",
      "Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said the ACLU is closely studying the impact and implementation of the order. Strangio said Tuesday that it's not yet clear whether changes will be retroactive with, for instance, State-Department-issued passports.",
      "\"I would anticipate a lot of future legal actions, but all of that will depend on what we actually see from the various agencies charged with implementing the various pieces of this executive order,\" Strangio said.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel with Lambda Legal that focuses on LGBT civil rights issues, also mentioned the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock as potentially counter to this order.",
      "\"We stand ready to challenge any of these implementation actions,\" he said.",
      "At the same time, some conservatives are pleased by the order.",
      "\"Trump has thrown down the gauntlet and made clear that his administration will protect women and girls and fight the gender ideologues who have enjoyed free reign for the past four years,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Jay Richards, who directs the Heritage Foundation's Center for Life, Religion, and Family. \"Of course, what can be done by executive order can be undone in the same way,\" Richards said, adding he hopes Congress will codify the definitions of male and female.",
      "The \"two sexes\" executive order is one of\u00a0more than 200 of executive actions\u00a0Mr. Trump took in his first day in office, ranging from attempting to end birthright citizenship to pardoning Jan. 6 rioters.",

      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A fire in the aft section of SpaceX's Starship trigged the apparent explosion that destroyed the spacecraft, the company says.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to carry out a formal investigation into the breakup of its Starship rocket during a test flight Thursday that sent a spectacular shower of flaming debris plummeting back to Earth, the agency announced Friday.",
      "\"The FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on Jan. 16,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"There are no reports of public injury, and the FAA is working with SpaceX and appropriate authorities to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "Within minutes of the Starship's breakup, along with videos posted on social media showing a shower of debris from a sudden fireball \u2014 possibly propellants igniting in the wake of the failure \u2014 the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and \"briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\"",
      "Other aircraft were briefly held up at South Florida airports and several \"requested to divert due to low fuel levels while holding outside impacted areas,\" the agency said.",
      "SpaceX, meanwhile, said initial data indicated a fire broke out in the rear part of the Starship, triggering the vehicle's destruction.",
      "\"The Starship upper stage successfully lit all six Raptor engines and performed its ascent burn to space,\" the company said on its web page. \"Prior to the burn's completion, telemetry was lost with the vehicle after approximately eight and a half minutes of flight. Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"",
      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",
      "How long the investigation might take -- and when the Super Heavy-Starship might fly again -- is not yet known. But it almost certainly will stretch out SpaceX's test program.",
      "Going into Thursday's test flight, SpaceX said 2025 \"will be transformational for Starship with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in 2027.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched by NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in lunar orbit and then descend to the surface.",
      "NASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts can be cleared to ride one down to the surface. The ongoing test program will determine when that might be possible.",

      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",
      "Getting the Super Heavy-Starship flying on a regular basis is critical to NASA's Artemis moon program. NASA is paying SpaceX to develop a variant of the Starship upper stage to carry astronauts down to the lunar surface in the 2027 timeframe.",
      "To send a Starship to the moon, SpaceX must first launch it to low-Earth orbit where a succession of other Starship \"tankers\" will have to rendezvous, dock and autonomously refuel the moon-bound ship so it can blast out of Earth orbit and head for deep space.",
      "Astronauts launched in an Orion capsule atop NASA's Space Launch System rocket then will rendezvous with the Starship in orbit around the moon for the descent to the surface.",
      "NASA's contract requires one unpiloted lunar landing test flight before astronauts can be cleared to ride one down to the surface. The ongoing test program will determine when that might be possible.",

      "Meta is denying claims circulating on social media that it forced Facebook and Instagram users to follow President Trump's official accounts, saying the changes some users noticed were standard practices tied to the transition of the POTUS account from the previous administration to the incoming one.",
      "The company also said that it is working to resolve an issue on Instagram that temporarily blocked certain political terms, including \"Democrats\" and \"Republican,\" from search results.",
      "Some Facebook and Instagram users reported on Monday that their accounts automatically followed President Trump, Vice President Vance, and first lady Melania Trump's accounts under the @POTUS, @VicePresident, and @FLOTUS handles, respectively. Some said they never followed the accounts in the first place, and when they tried to unfollow the pages they were prevented from doing so.",
      "Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the company did not make people's accounts follow the official presidential Facebook and Instagram accounts. Instead, people who had previously followed the official POTUS account saw it updated to reflect President Trump taking office.",
      "\"This is the same procedure we followed during the last presidential transition,\" Stone said, adding that people may experience delays when they try to follow or unfollow \"as these accounts change hands.\"",
      "Meta's public affairs director Nkechi Nneji told CBS News, \"Meta doesn't make anyone follow any account and we never have.\" Nneji said people might have forgotten that they opted to follow the official White House accounts during previous administrations.",

      "In general, when users want to unfollow an account on Facebook, they can click the ellipsis on that profile page and press the \"unfollow\" or \"block\" button.",
      "Additionally, some Instagram users reported being unable to see results for \"Democrat\" and other political words when they searched them, but that they were able to see results for \"Republican.\"",
      "Stone responded to the claims on Tuesday, saying a technical issue was \"affecting people's ability to search for a number of different hashtags on the platform \u2014 not just those on the left.\" Nneji told CBS News on Wednesday that technical issues with searches for political and non-political terms had mostly been resolved on the mobile app.",
      "CBS News searched variations of \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\" on the mobile version of Instagram on Wednesday and returned millions of results.",
      "However, on the desktop version of Instagram, the search returned no results for \"Republican\" and \"Democrats,\" but did yield results for \"Republicans\" and \"Democrat.\" Additionally, there were no results for other words, like \"Constitution,\" on the desktop version, but over a million results on the mobile app.",
      "Mr. Trump's personal Facebook and Instagram accounts were\u00a0suspended\u00a0following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, after the company said his posts incited violence. His accounts were\u00a0reactivated\u00a0in 2023.",
      "The timing of the latest issues raised concerns among some Facebook and Instagram users. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended President Trump's inauguration on Monday, along with other tech leaders including X owner Elon Musk and Amazon executive chair Jeff Bezos.",
      "Zuckerberg announced the end\u00a0of Facebook's third-party fact checking program on Jan. 7 because of what he said were concerns of bias and the over-enforcement of rules. The platform will instead adopt a community approach similar to X's Community Notes.",
      "Zuckerberg also announced the platform would start phasing in more recommendations for political content, reversing a decision made in February 2021 when Zuckerberg said he received feedback that people \"don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAi's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "story": [
      "Monterey County supervisors on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in response to last week's major fire at the Vistra lithium battery plant in Moss Landing.",
      "The emergency declaration came during a special meeting where officials gave updates on the fire and ongoing response. While the fire has burned itself out, there are still a lot of questions from local leaders and neighbors about what's next.",
      "\"This was the beginning,\" said Josh Contreras as he showed photos he took of the incident from his houseboat.",
      "The images show a fireball on the horizon, not even a mile away.",
      "\"I walked up the docks, and then I took more photos,\" he said. \"Because you could see the flames, probably almost as tall as the towers that stand here.\"",
      "The fire at the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant, located about 90 miles south of San Francisco,\u00a0broke out last Thursday afternoon, escalating in the early evening to the point where the incident\u00a0triggered evacuations for about 1,200 Monterey County residents\u00a0in the area and shut down a section of Highway 1 in both directions.",
      "Concerned over the potentially toxic runoff if fire crews turned hoses on the burning lithium batteries, officials instead are allowing the to burn itself out.",
      "Officials\u00a0said the fire was largely out as of late Friday morning\u00a0during a press conference, but it flared up significantly for a few hours that afternoon before dying down again. Officials were eventually able to lift the evacuation orders by early Friday evening. The stretch of Highway 1 near the plant remained closed until Sunday.",
      "Now that the fire is out, he is one of the many people living in the area what lies in the future for the facility.",
      "\"If they do battery packs, they should keep it in more deserted areas,\" Contreras said.",
      "\"This technology is ahead of the government's ability to regulate it,\" Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church said during the emergency meeting Tuesday. \"And the industry's ability to control it.\"",
      "Supervisors were asking similar questions about the fire. A representative from Vistra said were just getting access to the burned-out lithium battery facility. The incident was enough for Church, who last week likened the fire to a \"Three Mile Island\" event for the emerging industry -- to draw this conclusion:",
      "\"Battery storage is essential for the future. And that's the direction we're going,\" Church noted. \"But -- as I said last night and I've tried to emphasize -- we just can't put that above safety. That's got to be the priority at this point.\"",
      "Church is calling for the Vistra facility to remain closed until an independent investigation can determine the cause of the incident.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we're on a pretty steep learning curve with battery safety still,\" said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor of environmental sciences at San Jose State University. \"And we're still figuring out ways that these batteries catch on fire. We're still figuring out how to best suppress them.\"",
      "Mulvaney  said the Moss Landing facility fire will be a wake-up call for the entire industry, right down to the people who insure the batteries. A lot of people will want to know what went wrong, and where, in a plant that is a hodgepodge of lithium battery technology.",
      "\"That site is actually an example of different ways to design it,\" Mulvaney explained. \"Because it was built in different phases. They took advantage of different opportunities to put things in different places. But this example will cause the industry to reflect on how they built these things. Because they have to be better neighbors to the community.\"",
      "Those who live in the community are reflecting on what it means to have this plant as a neighbor.",
      "\"Yeah. It should be out in the desert,\" said plant neighbor Julie Nieman. \"Somewhere in Nevada, out in the desert where people aren't around. Why would you put it where people live, in this beautiful area by the ocean?\"",
      "With the exception of one closed roadway beside the plant, things in Moss Landing are pretty much back to normal. The parks and beaches have to reopened, though some people have raised additional questions about the impact the fire had on the environment, particularly the sensitive Elkhorn Slough Reserve. The wetlands area is home to a number of endangered sea otters.",

Jamison said he wasn't doing as well as he wanted to in school and thought his phone use could be a \"big factor in that.\" Although Ranita plays three sports, she admitted wasting time on her phone, watching 30 minutes of scrolling turn into an hour without noticing. Carson agreed to participate, but the avid basketball player was nervous. Maya, who loves studying English and just started rowing, was hoping the trial would help her sleep better at night.",
      "The day CBS News sat down with the teens and took their iPhones and iPads and gave them flip phones, the reactions were a mix of laughing, shaking and confusion.

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:19:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "Washington \u2014 TikTok began restoring service to users in the United States following a temporary and voluntary shutdown that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to try to pause the ban by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "\"We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,\" TikTok said in a statement. \"It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"",
      "STATEMENT FROM TIKTOK:In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170\u2026",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's China-bases parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",

      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",

We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "Although some major political figures will notably be absent from President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, some of the world's most prominent business leaders are scheduled to attend his swearing-in.",
      "Top technology company CEOs, whose companies have collectively donated millions to Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee, are expected to have a conspicuous presence at the ceremony. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is\u00a0scheduled to attend, sources told CBS News this week; the online retailer was among the companies that donated $1 million to the fund.",
      "Other chief executives\u00a0set to attend Trump's inauguration include Google's Sundar Pichai; Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, whose company also contributed $1 million to the inauguration fund; and TikTok CEO Shou Chew, whose company could go dark in the U.S. as soon as Sunday after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a law that could lead to a ban.",
      "Not surprisingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom Trump has tapped along with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to explore ways to cut federal spending, will also appear at the inauguration, CBS News has confirmed. Musk said\u00a0on his social media platform, X, this week that he felt \"honored\" to sit alongside Bezos and \u00a0Zuckerberg on the inauguration dais, where Cabinet members, nominees and elected officials are placed.",
      "Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0that Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Apple's Tim Cook also are scheduled to appear. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Seating arrangements at the inauguration ceremony could change after\u00a0Trump announced it is being moved indoors due to frigid temperatures. The event will now be held under the Capitol dome, which is typically used for congressional ceremonies and celebrations.",
      "Forecasters said temperatures during the noon event could fall to around 22 degrees, the chilliest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in January of 1985, when the mercury plummeted to 7 degrees.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",

      "The company also said it uses a number of means to support customers and ensure they are protected while using Cash App. Those include providing multiple ways for customers to contact Block, such as a dispute submission tool within Cash App; using AI to spot and stop fraud; and using advanced technology to warn customers about potential scams involving their transactions.",
      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

    "story": [
      "Two Native Hawaiian brothers who were convicted in the 1991 killing of a woman visiting Hawaii allege in a federal lawsuit that local police framed them \"under immense pressure to solve the high-profile murder\" then botched an investigation last year that would have revealed the real killer using advancements in DNA technology.",
      "Albert \"Ian\" Schweitzer, who had been incarcerated for more than two decades for the killing of Dana Ireland, was released in 2023 based on new evidence. Ireland, 23, a tourist from Virginia, was visiting a remote part of the Big Island when she was found along a fishing trail, raped and beaten and barely alive. She died at a hospital.",
      "Schweitzer was one of three men who spent time behind bars over her killing, but he always maintained his innocence. His brother Shawn Schweitzer took a deal to plead guilty to manslaughter and kidnapping - and receive credit for about a year served and five years of probation - after a jury convicted his brother in 2000.",
      "The brothers' lawsuit insists they \"had nothing to do with the crime\" and that investigators never found physical evidence linking them to Ireland's murder.",
      "The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Honolulu. It names as defendants Hawaii County, the county police chief, as well as former detectives and a prosecutor who handled the case. Both the county and the police chief say they won't comment on pending litigation.",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for a man charged with murder in connection with the killings of four University of Idaho students are asking a judge to throw out most of the evidence in the case because they say it all hinges on an unconstitutional genetic investigation process.",
      "Bryan Kohberger's defense team also contends that the search warrants in the case were tainted by police misconduct. They will make their arguments during a two-day hearing starting Thursday morning, part of which will be closed to the public. If they are successful, it could throw a major wrench in the prosecution's case before the trial starts in August.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys say law enforcement violated his constitutional rights when they used a process called Investigative Genetic Genealogy, or IGG, to identify possible suspects.",
      "\"There would be no investigation into him without that original constitutional violation,\" attorneys Jay Weston Logsdon and Ann Taylor wrote in a court filing. They later continued, \"Without IGG, there is no case, no request for his phone records, surveillance of his parents' home, no DNA taken from the garbage out front. Because the IGG analysis is the origin of this matter, everything in the affidavit should be excised.\"",
      "The IGG process often starts when DNA found at the scene of a crime doesn't yield any results through standard law enforcement databases. When that happens, investigators may look at all the variations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, that are in the DNA sample. Those SNPs, or \"snips,\" are then uploaded to a genealogy database like GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA to look for possible relatives of the person whose DNA was found at the scene.",
      "In Kohberger's case, investigators said they found \"touch DNA,\" or trace DNA, on the sheath of a knife that was found in the home where the students were fatally stabbed. The FBI used the IGG process on that DNA and the information identified Kohberger as a possible suspect.",
      "Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson and the rest of the prosecution team say there is nothing unconstitutional about the use of IGG, noting that Kohberger's relatives voluntarily provided their own DNA to a genetic genealogy service. They've also argued in court filings that case law is clear: Defendants have no reasonable right to privacy for DNA that is left at the scene of a crime.",
      "The defense team also says that once Kohberger was identified as a possible suspect, law enforcement officers either purposely or recklessly lied or omitted crucial information when they asked the court to issue search warrants for his apartment, his parents' house, his car, his cellphone and even for his own DNA. They want all of that evidence kept out of the trial as well.",
      "Specific details about the alleged police misconduct are hidden from public view, however; 4th District Judge Steven Hippler has kept most of those court filings, along with many of the court documents on the IGG evidence, under seal. Part of the hearing starting Thursday will be held behind closed doors because the judge says he doesn't want potential jurors \"tainted\" by hearing about any evidence that might not be allowed in trial.",
      "On Wednesday, a coalition of news organizations including The Associated Press asked the judge to reconsider the secrecy.",
      "\"In any criminal case, I would submit that it's of extreme public interest to know whether a law enforcement officer sworn to tell the truth ... made reckless or false statements\" during an investigation, the news organizations' attorney, Wendy Olson, said during a hearing on Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that the public and the press have a First Amendment right to open court proceedings, she said, and that open courts also help to protect the rights of the accused.",
      "\"Openness and transparency are more important than ever in maintaining and restoring confidence in our government institutions,\" Olson said.",

      "Nominations for the 97th annual Academy Awards are being announced Thursday morning after being delayed twice due to the Los Angeles area wildfires.",
      "Actors Bowen Yang and Rachel Sennott are tapped to host Thursday's live announcement with the nominees expected to be revealed starting at 8:30 a.m. EST (5:30 a.m. PST).",
      "What movies are predicted to get Oscar nominations?",
      "While many expect to see blockbusters like \"Wicked\" and \"Dune: Part Two\" among this year's top nominees, the awards leading up to this moment in the movie awards season also suggest that smaller, critically acclaimed movies like \"Anora,\" \"The Brutalist\" and \"Conclave\" will be among this year's most-nominated films.",
      "The latter film, an adaptation of a Robert Harris novel showcasing expected best actor nominee Ralph Fiennes as the representative overseeing a contentious papal conclave, received the most BAFTA nominations of any movie last year with 12. The voting body at BAFTA includes a significant overlap with the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who determine each year's Oscar nominees, so a strong performance at the former organization is generally considered to be an encouraging bellwether for the latter.",
      "Close behind \"Conclave\" in overall BAFTA nominations with 11 is \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" a crime musical centering around a cartel leader who has transitioned. Actress Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, playing the titular role, could make Oscar history by being the first transgender woman to be nominated in any acting category.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" won four Golden Globes earlier this month, including best motion picture musical or comedy, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a's performance. \"The Brutalist,\" a 215-minute epic about a Holocaust survivor who emigrates to America post-WWII, won Golden Globes for best motion picture drama, and lead actor Adrian Brody was also a Globe winner.",
      "Another Globe winner expected to earn an Academy Award nomination Thursday morning: Demi Moore, whose performance in the bloody body horror hit \"The Substance\" has stirred up a conversation on the industry's mistreatment of women of an age. Both Moore and the film itself are expected to get nominations in the top Oscar categories.",
      "When is the Oscar awards ceremony?",
      "The nominations were originally scheduled for Jan. 17 but, as with a number of other industry awards ceremonies that traditionally make up Hollywood's social calendar in January, the proliferation of wildfires in the Los Angeles area had organizers scrambling to reschedule. The Oscars nominees luncheon has been canceled, the academy says. It had been scheduled for Feb. 10.",

    "summary": "Mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. could hurt a range of U.S. industries, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "In one of his first acts after returning to the Oval Office this week, President Trump tasked federal agencies with developing ways to potentially ease prices for U.S. consumers. But experts warn that his administration's crackdown on immigration could both drive up inflation as well as hurt a range of businesses by shrinking the nation's workforce.",
      "\"A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages, which has different sector implications including inflationary pressure, especially for food prices,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said labor shortages stemming from the Trump administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants could curtail the production of some products and services.",
      "\"Ultimately, the main way immigration affects inflation is that if jobs are left open and production is unable to keep up with demand, that's going to lead to higher prices,\" he said.",
      "What sectors depend most on immigrant labor?",
      "According to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies of New York and other groups, roughly 8.3 million undocumented immigrants work in the U.S, or just over 5% of the country's workforce.",
      "Undocumented immigrants account for about 20% of the agriculture industry's overall workforce, although that figure can rise to roughly half for some speciality farms, according to Capital Economics, which advises large investors.",
      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Trump administration officials are considering deploying as many as 10,000 soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border and using Department of Defense bases to hold migrants awaiting deportation as they plan their dramatic crackdown on illegal immigration, according to an internal government memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an executive action Mr. Trump signed upon taking office on Monday, he declared a national emergency along the southern border and ordered the Defense Department to provide troops and resources \"to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control\" of the border. He also instructed the military to help build border barriers to repel migrants.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the president had signed another executive order to deploy 1,500 troops to the southern border, where 2,500 soldiers are already stationed under federal orders. Texas and other states have also deployed National Guard soldiers to the border in recent years, including to fortify it with razor wire.",
      "But the internal Customs and Border Protection memo dated Jan. 21 indicates there's a plan to dispatch \"~10,000 soldiers\" to help the agency's mission at the southern border. The Trump administration, according to the document, has submitted an \"[u]nrestrained request\" for the Pentagon to surge resources and personnel to assist CBP with technology and infrastructure.",
      "The memo also says the Defense Department \"may\" convert its bases into \"holding facilities,\" presumably to help CBP detain migrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally.",
      "Additionally, the memo shows the Trump administration is planning to dramatically expand detention capacity at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is expected to be at the center of Mr. Trump's promised mass deportations.",
      "According to the document, ICE officials want 14 new detention facilities with the capacity to hold up to 1,000 migrants each and another four able to accommodate as many as 10,000 immigrant detainees each.",
      "During a briefing with reporters, a senior U.S. military official said the 1,500-troop deployment would involve dispatching 1,000 Army personnel and 500 Marines, as well as helicopters, to the California and Texas border. The official said the troops would not engage in law enforcement, as federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. Instead, the official said they would be tasked with helping CBP and erecting border barriers, to curtail illegal crossings.",
      "The Department of Defense also announced it would \"provide military airlift to support\" deportation flights for more than 5,000 migrants detained along the U.S.-Mexico border by CBP. Officials said the Department of Homeland Security would offer in-flight law enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to greatly expand the role of the U.S. military in border enforcement \u2014 historically limited to operational and administrative duties \u2014 is part of a larger campaign to seal U.S. borders to migrants and asylum-seekers.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed U.S. immigration agents along the borders with Mexico and Canada to swiftly and summarily deport migrants crossing into the country illegally, denying them the opportunity to request asylum, according to CBP officials and internal documents.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Citing President Trump's extraordinary move to close the American asylum system, U.S. border agents have been instructed to summarily deport migrants crossing into the country illegally without allowing them to request legal protection, according to internal government documents and agency officials.",
      "Just hours after being sworn in, Mr. Trump invoked sweeping presidential authorities to bar the entry of migrants deemed to be participating in an \"invasion\" of the U.S., as well as those who may pose a public health or national security risk. He cited a provision of immigration law known as 212(f) that allows presidents to suspend the entry of foreigners whose entry is deemed to be \"detrimental\" to the U.S.",
      "In that same proclamation, Mr. Trump cited his constitutional powers over foreign affairs to empower U.S. immigration officials to \"repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion across the southern border of the United States.\"",
      "Internal government documents indicate that, as of Tuesday night, the president's \"full\" 212(f) authority was being implemented across Texas' border with Mexico, making nearly all migrants who arrive there subject to quick expulsion. The documents cite the public health-related 212(f) authority that applies to \"aliens that traveled through a country with a communicable disease.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's edict also applies to Border Patrol coastal sectors, including the one in Florida, and the U.S.-Canada border. The documents indicate Canadian authorities will be asked to accept those who cross the northern border illegally, beyond those asylum claimants the U.S. and Canada already exchange under a \"safe-third-country\" agreement.",
      "Two Customs and Border Protection officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal guidance, said migrants will not be allowed to see an immigration judge or asylum officer under Mr. Trump's edict, which effectively suspends U.S. obligations under domestic and international law to ensure people fleeing persecution are not returned to danger.",
      "One of the officials said Border Patrol agents were directed to swiftly deport migrant adults and families traveling with children under the president's directives, after taking their biometrics and fingerprints. Migrants who are not from Mexico are to be detained pending their deportation.",
      "Those with criminal histories are subject to prosecution in the U.S. under a long-standing practice, the official said.",
      "Releases of migrants into the U.S. have been largely prohibited. The internal government documents say requests to release migrants with a court notice will need to be approved by Border Patrol headquarters and will only be considered in \"life-threatening\" situations.",
      "The official said the new policy mirrors Title 42, a far-reaching order the first Trump administration enacted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic to expel most migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally. The order, based on a contested public health rationale that migrants would spread COVID-19, was eventually discontinued by the Biden administration, which relied on the measure for more than two years amid record levels of migrant crossings.",
      "The Biden administration enacted its own asylum restriction last June, also citing the 212(f) authorities. While that order disqualified most migrants crossing the southern border illegally from asylum, it still gave them the opportunity to plead their case before asylum officers if they expressed fear of being harmed once deported.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's asylum restrictions also had a major exemption: they did not apply to migrants waiting in Mexico who used a government smartphone app, known as CBP One, to request a time to enter the U.S. at an official border entry point.",
      "But immediately after Mr. Trump's inauguration, his administration shut down the CBP One process and canceled all existing appointments under the app, which had been allowing up to 1,500 migrants to enter the U.S. each day.",
      "While the Biden administration faced record numbers of migrant arrivals in its first three years, illegal border crossing dropped sharply in 2024 after the Mexican government ramped up efforts to interdict those traveling to the U.S. Unlawful crossings fell further after Biden's own asylum crackdown in June, and remain at a four-year low.",
      "Mr. Trump's moves at the border, like his unprecedented attempt to upend birthright citizenship, are likely to face legal challenges.",
      "\"Put simply, this order ends asylum at the United States border for anyone fleeing danger, even for families persecuted on the basis of their religion or political speech,\" said Lee Gelernt, who leads the American Civil Liberties Union's immigration lawsuits.",

      "Prosecutors alleged Rhodes and his fellow Oath Keepers planned for violence ahead of the Capitol attack and celebrated their actions in the aftermath.",
      "Before Rhodes' sentencing, prosecutors said he \"pushed the idea among Oath Keepers members and others that with a large enough mob, they could intimidate Congress and its members and impose the conspirators' will rather than the American people's: to stop the certification of the next President of the United States.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:04:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have asked federal judges in Washington to dismiss pending indictments against defendants charged as a result of conduct on Jan. 6, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's order issuing sweeping pardons to defendants convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol has been met with sharp condemnations from federal judges in Washington, D.C., who presided over the cases and are now dismissing charges at the request of federal prosecutors in the new administration.",
      "The judges publicly voiced their discontent in a trio of separate orders issued Wednesday, two days after Mr. Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants and ordered any pending prosecutions to be dismissed just hours after he was sworn into office for a second term.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's order, prosecutors in Washington have been seeking to end ongoing cases. The Justice Department said earlier this month that there were roughly 300 pending cases related to the Capitol assault. Nearly 60% of those defendants were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder, which are felonies, it said.",
      "Citing the years spent reviewing evidence and adjudicating hundreds of cases involving defendants charged with violent and nonviolent criminal offenses, the judges rebuked efforts to downplay the events of Jan. 6.",
      "One order issued by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw the election interference case against Mr. Trump that was dismissed after his election in November, states that \"no pardon can change the tragic truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "\"In hundreds of cases like this one over the past four years, judges in this district have administered justice without fear or favor,\" Chutkan wrote. \"The historical record established by those proceedings must stand, unmoved by political winds, as a testament and as a warning.\"",
      "The dismissal of the case, she said, \"cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"",
      "Chutkan's order came in the case against John Banuelos, an Illinois man who was arrested in March and faced five charges, including obstruction of law enforcement and entering a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors said he was seen on security footage in a crowd of rioters who breached a police line on the Capitol grounds, and court documents allegedly show an image of Banuelos with what appears to be a firearm in the waistband of his pants. Security footage from the attack later appears to show him scaling scaffolding around the inaugural stage, pulling the gun from his waistband and firing two shots in the air, prosecutors said. Banuelos pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "Another order from U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell rebuffs Mr. Trump's claim that the Jan. 6 prosecutions represented a \"grave national injustice\" and that clemency would begin a \"process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "\"No 'national injustice' occurred here, just as no outcome-determinative election fraud occurred in the 2020 presidential election,\" Howell wrote, quoting Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"No 'process of national reconciliation' can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity. That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law.\"",
      "The judge said she had presided over \"scores\" of cases involving defendants charged for their conduct outside and inside the Capitol building and said charges were \"fully supported\" by videos, photos, admissions by defendants themselves during plea hearings and the testimony of law enforcement and congressional staff who were at the Capitol.",
      "\"[T]his court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that the cases reflect the work of prosecutors, law enforcement officers and defense attorneys \"to defend our democracy and rights and preserve our long tradition of peaceful transfers of power \u2014 which, until January 6, 2021, served as a model to the world \u2014 all while affording those charged every protection guaranteed by our Constitution and the criminal justice system.\"",
      "Howell was granting the government's request to dismiss a nine-count superseding indictment against Nicholas DeCarlo and Nicholas Ochs, who had earlier entered into plea deals and admitted to throwing smoke bombs at police officers and property damage and theft.",
      "Ochs founded the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, according to court documents. The two entered the Capitol and smoked cigarettes in the Crypt \u2014 which is located just below the Rotunda \u2014 filings show, and DeCarlo shouted \"Where's Nancy?\" a reference to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as they made their way through the building.",
      "A third order from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the government's request to toss out an indictment charging Dominic Box with seven felony and misdemeanor counts. He was found guilty of six counts last year, including civil disorder and disorderly conduct. Kollar-Kotelly wrote that Box was among the first group of rioters who entered the Capitol building on Jan. 6 and went on to overrun police officers in the Crypt.",
      "He was set to be sentenced on Feb. 21.",
      "Like her colleagues on the district court, Kollar-Kotelly said the events of Jan. 6 are preserved through videos, trial transcripts, jury verdicts and judicial opinions analyzing the evidence.",
      "\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies,\" she wrote.",
      "Dismissal of charges, pardons and commutations of sentences, the judge said, \"will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021.\"",
      "Kollar-Kotelly also praised the Capitol Police and local law enforcement who responded to the attack at the Capitol to protect lawmakers and staff, the vice president and his family, and the Capitol building.",
      "\"For hours, those officers were aggressively confronted and violently assaulted. More than 140 officers were injured. Others tragically passed away as a result of the events of that day,\" she wrote. \"But law enforcement did not falter. Standing with bear spray streaming down their faces, those officers carried out their duty to protect.\"",
      "Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump had vowed to issue pardons to Jan. 6 defendants, who he has called \"hostages\" and political prisoners.\" But the scope of the pardons came as a surprise to some, as they were \"full, complete and unconditional.\"",
      "The president also commuted the sentences of 14 defendants, including high-ranking members of the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Some, like Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, were serving sentences after they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes.",
      "Howell and Chutkan were nominated to the court by former President Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Kollar-Kotelly was selected by former President Bill Clinton and has served since 1997.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAi's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has terminated its advisory committees, wiping out decades of institutional experience and abruptly ending a sweeping investigation into the Chinese-linked hack of U.S. telecom companies, sources familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News.",
      "According to a memo signed by Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine C. Huffman, and obtained by CBS News, the decision to disband multiple advisory committees is being made \"in alignment with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) commitment to eliminating the misuse of resources and ensuring that DHS activities prioritize our national security.\"",
      "\"I am directing the termination of all current memberships on the advisory committees within DHS, effective immediately,\" the memo, dated Jan. 20, stated.",
      "DHS has several advisory committees, including panels that offer advice to department personnel on issues including natural disaster and emergency preparedness, critical infrastructure, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.",
      "Among them is the Cyber Safety Review Board \u2014 a body designed to emulate the National Transportation Safety Board. The group was conducting a comprehensive investigation into the hack of American telecom companies by Beijing actors dubbed \"Salt Typhoon.\"",
      "Described by some lawmakers as the most devastating breach in telecom history, the ongoing cyberespionage operation compromised the metadata of hundreds of thousands of Americans, plus targeted the communications of President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other senior government officials, CBS News previously reported.",
      "In a statement, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said the move \"waved a white flag to Chinese hackers.\"",
      "\"Disbanding the Cyber Safety Review Board while it's in the middle of investigating the most damaging breach of America's phone system in recent memory is a massive gift to the Chinese spies who targeted Trump, JD Vance and other top political figures,\" he added.",
      "Also among the committees eliminated was the Homeland Security Advisory Council. Members of the committee included former secretaries of Homeland Security, DEA administrators, police union presidents and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "\"Future committee activities will be focused solely on advancing our critical mission to protect the homeland and support DHS's strategic priorities,\" Huffman wrote in his letter.",

    "summary": "The legislation expands the federal government's mandate to detain undocumented immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House approved the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday, signing off on the Senate's changes to the legislation aimed at expanding the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "The House passed the legislation in a 263 to 156 vote. It now heads to President Trump's desk, where it's expected to be the first piece of legislation he signs in his new term.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. It would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. The legislation also includes a provision that empowers state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "\"This legislation would simply say that we have to detain some of the worst people that are here illegally,\" Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said on the House floor Wednesday.",
      "Some Democrats spent floor debate ahead of the vote focused on the pardons Mr. Trump granted to people convicted for their actions related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, arguing it was hypocritical for Republicans who supported the pardons to push this bill.",
      "\"These are the people who want you to believe, want us to believe, that they are keeping violent criminals off the streets,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said.",
      "The House approved a version of the legislation earlier this month in a 264 to 159 vote, with 48 Democrats joining Republicans. It then went to the Senate, where an amended version passed with bipartisan support on Monday.",
      "The Senate's changes expanded the legislation's scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. Democrats had also hoped to further amend the legislation, seeking to protect DACA recipients and eliminate the provision that empowers state attorneys general, among other things. Still, 12 Senate Democrats ultimately backed the legislation, propelling it to passage.",
      "The support from Democrats comes after the measure stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate last year, when the House first approved it. Democrats have appeared more willing to engage on the measure in the new Congress, following the 2024 election, in which immigration was a key issue.",
      "Still, the legislation has prompted questions among some Democrats, including whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding.",

    "summary": "No president has ever exercised this constitutional power, but \"this remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,\" one source said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is threatening to use his powers to adjourn Congress so he can make recess appointments for at least some of his top Cabinet nominees and their deputies, enabling them to begin running the largest federal departments.",
      "Mr. Trump most recently raised the prospect of plunging the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory during his White House meeting Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, mulling the option if Democrats opt to slow-walk or delay his top national security and public health nominees, according to two people familiar with the meetings.",
      "\"This remains a significant possibility in the eyes of the White House,\" one of the people familiar with the meetings said, emphasizing this is not expected to happen this week, but remains under active consideration.",
      "Mr. Trump has signaled he wants the Senate to move quickly to confirm his top Cabinet picks, and Republican senators have said for weeks they want to move swiftly, particularly on his top national security appointments. On Monday night, the Senate unanimously confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but votes on John Ratcliffe to serve as CIA director, Pete Hegseth to serve as defense secretary, and Kristi Noem to serve as homeland security secretary, are still in the queue for consideration.",
      "Procedural issues are delaying those votes, with Democrats slowing consideration of Ratcliffe and Republicans warning they'll hold a final up-or-down vote on him over the weekend, if necessary.",
      "It is unclear how long Mr. Trump would recess Congress, given that a possible government shutdown looms in mid-March and Republican leaders have set an April goal of passing massive economic, tax and immigration legislation that would authorize Mr. Trump's plans to cut inflation and taxes and dramatically overhaul border security policy.",
      "How can Trump adjourn Congress?",
      "The second clause of Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution gives the president the power to convene the House and Senate in certain cases. While presidents over the course of U.S. history have frequently summoned both chambers for special sessions, or the Senate to vote on key nominees or treaties, no president has ever exercised his constitutional power to adjourn the two chambers.",
      "The lack of precedent means any Trump decision to adjourn the Senate would likely face immediate legal challenge ultimately resulting in appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Here's one example of how it would work: The House is scheduled to leave Washington for up to 10 days starting Friday, so the two parties can hold their annual policy retreats. The GOP-controlled House could pass a resolution formally adjourning for that length of time and send the resolution to the Senate. The upper chamber, where at least 60 votes would be needed to consider a consent resolution, would either also adjourn or fail to agree to do so. Under the Constitution, both houses of Congress must agree to adjourn for more than three days. If the Senate does not agree, the president could try using his adjournment power to send the Senate home, launching the executive and legislative branches into uncharted constitutional territory.",
      "Talk about flexing this never-used power dates back to the last year of the first Trump presidency, when Democrats were blocking hundreds of executive and judicial nominees. Conservative activists began pushing the White House to consider the adjournment powers, something Mr. Trump never used. Now, emboldened by his second victory and far more familiar with the powers of the presidency, Mr. Trump is actively discussing the option.",
      "The president raised the prospect of recess appointments in an advisory way to Thune on Tuesday, the sources said, who would prefer that Mr. Trump avoid this move to preserve and protect institutional prerogatives. On Tuesday after the Mr. Trump meeting, the Senate majority leader expressed public skepticism and said any move by Mr. Trump to adjourn Congress should be blamed on Democrats.",
      "\"I think we're going to find out here pretty quickly whether or not the Democrats want to help us get through some of these nominations in a way that gets us back on track with the way it was done prior to the last two presidencies,\" he said.",
      "Both parties have spent much of the 21st century using what had been obscure procedural tactics to delay or slowly derail presidential nominees for Cabinet posts, regulatory agency boards and federal judgeships.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "Any president can appoint someone to a position requiring Senate confirmation whenever the chamber is in recess. Back when the country began and traveling to and from Washington by horse or train took far longer, recess appointments were a far more urgent need. Now, with Congress able to function year-round, it's more of a political tactic.",
      "Any nominees appointed to a position during a congressional recess must be confirmed by the end of the next calendar year, meaning if Mr. Trump were to make recess appointments early this year, they could serve in their roles until December 2026. Once a new congressional session begins, a president can renominate recess appointees for Senate confirmation \u2014 or issue a fresh recess appointment for them.",
      "The biggest legal test of the power came in 2014, when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled President Obama had violated the recess appointments clause by naming three picks to the National Labor Relations Board in 2012. The justices said the Senate was not actually in a formal recess when Obama acted.",

      "The Justice Department's new leadership directed prosecutors and law enforcement across the country to focus on enacting President Trump's immigration policies and said they should potentially charge state or local officials who impede their efforts, according to a memo sent to employees on Tuesday and obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"The Supremacy Clause and other authorities require state and local actors to comply with the Executive Branch's immigration enforcement initiatives. Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing, and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,\" Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote, citing the president's constitutional authority and several federal laws.",
      "\"The U.S. Attorney's Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution,\" he added.",
      "Bove, a longtime federal prosecutor who served on President Trump's criminal defense team before joining the department, also directed the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces to \"assist in the execution of President Trump's immigration-related initiatives.\" The task forces are groups of law enforcement and intelligence officers based in cities across the country who typically investigate terrorism threats. An executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Monday initiated a process by which certain cartels could be recognized as foreign terrorist organizations by the U.S.",
      "The three-page directive also said the Justice Department's law enforcement components, including the FBI and DEA, should identify any evidence related to noncitizens in the U.S. within 60 days and pass that information along to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The memo said cartels, violent crime and the fentanyl crisis are \"three of the most serious threats facing the American people\" and ordered that, consistent with an executive order signed by Mr. Trump earlier this week, \"the Justice Department must, and will, work to eradicate these threats.\"",
      "Bove's message emphasized that state or local officials who seek to obstruct or refuse to comply with federal immigration law enforcement efforts risked investigation and potential prosecution.",
      "The memo also directed all federal prosecutors to charge \"the most serious, readily provable offenses\" in any case, returning to a department policy enforced most recently during Mr. Trump's first term in office. He rescinded Biden-era policies that offered prosecutors more discretion in their charging decisions and could lead to lesser charges or less severe penalties.",

      "\"The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost U.S. taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023,\" DOGE wrote. \"The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.\"",
      "In pointing out the penny's costliness, DOGE is taking aim at an issue that has sparked debate for years, although the price of manufacturing the cent has only grown over the past several years. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. was spending about 1.5 cents to mint each penny, or less than half of its current manufacturing cost.",

      "Federal officials have proposed suspending the penny in prior years, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pushing the idea in 2015. Some economists have also advocated for dropping the penny from circulation, but there could be a costly downside to ditching the cent, as transactions would be rounded to 5-cent intervals, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a 2020 blog post.",
      "\"For a single item or small-value purchase, rounding up or down could represent a significant price change,\" the post noted.",
      "Other nations have ditched their equivalent of the penny, including Canada, which stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. One 2018 economic analysis found that Canadian consumers paid about $3.27 million in additional Canadian dollars at grocery stores each year due to prices being rounded higher after the change.",

It was one of a number of lawsuits Harry has brought against newspapers in Britain.",
      "\"NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun,\" the media company said in a statement read out in court Wednesday. The statement also included an apology for the activities of journalists and private investigators working for the News of the World.",
      "\"NGN further apologizes to the Duke for the impact on him of the extensive coverage and serious intrusion into his private life as well as the private life of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother, in particular during his younger years. We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the Duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family, and have agreed to pay him substantial damages,\" the statement said.",
      "News Group has faced numerous lawsuits over allegations of phone hacking and illegal information gathering, and it has settled more that 1,300 involving politicians and celebrities. It has always denied, however, that The Sun newspaper was involved in any illegal activities, or that senior figures were aware of anything illegal and tried to cover it up.",
      "Harry had previously said he wanted to go to trial to get to the truth, rather than to get a payout, after other claimants settled out of court.",

      "Istanbul, Turkey \u2014 A fire engulfed a hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, killing at least 76 people and injuring at least 51 more, the interior minister said. Witnesses said desperate guests had tried to escape using ropes, and video showed bedsheets hanging from the windows. Officials suggested at least two people died after trying to jump from the building to safety, and the private broadcaster NTV reported three died this way.",
      "At least one of the individuals suffered serious injuries, said Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, while 17 others received treatment for less severe injuries. Survivors who evacuated the building were rehoused in nearby hotels.",
      "\"Our pain is great,\" Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the Kartalkaya resort, about 100 miles northwest of the capital Ankara. \"Sixty-six citizens lost their lives and 51 others wounded.\"",
      "Other cabinet members also came to the scene of the disaster and said the blaze had been contained. The fire broke out at 3:27 am (7:27 p.m. Monday Eastern ) in the 12-story Grand Kartal hotel, which has wooden cladding, Yerlikaya said earlier on X.",

Atakan Yelkovan, a guest staying on the third floor, told AP it took firefighters about an hour to arrive at the scene. Part of the hotel backs onto a cliff, which made it harder for firefighters to tackle the blaze.",
      "Video aired on Turkish television showed huge plumes of smoke rising into the sky with a snowcapped mountain behind the hotel.",
      "\"I heard screams around midnight, (hotel) residents were shouting for help,\" Baris Salgur, who works at a nearby hotel, told NTV television. \"They asked for a blanket, saying they will jump... we did what we could, we brought rope, pillows, we brought a sofa. Some people threw themselves once the flames approached them.\"",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says Europe must \"wake up\" and spend more on its defense as Trump returns, but how realistic is the suggestion?",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump cemented his return to the White House, French President Emmanuel Macron told his European counterparts\u00a0this week to \"wake up\" and spend more on the continent's defense to reduce the continent's reliance on the United States for security.",
      "\"What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?\" Macron said Monday, addressing members of the French military.",
      "President Trump has often criticized America's NATO allies for failing to meet domestic defense spending targets. At a February 2024 campaign rally in South Carolina, he said he'd encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO allies who don't meet the target.",
      "In the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump repeated a demand he first made in January that NATO \"needs to pay 5%.\" Under a 2014 agreement made by the group, the alliance's more than 30 member states committed to aim to spend at least 2% of the value of their domestic economies on defense every year. During his first term in office, Mr. Trump pressured America's allies to meet that threshold, and some have increased their military spending since that time, but many still do not make the 2% bar.",
      "In his remarks just two days after the U.S. election in November, Macron called on Europeans \"to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy\" and to decrease reliance on U.S. military hardware and defense leadership.",
      "CBS News has spoken with analysts and former officials from several European countries and NATO following the U.S. election. The experts, from Poland, Italy, Germany, the U.K. and the NATO alliance itself, vary in their assessments of the feasibility of Macron's broad vision, but they largely agree that Europe can and should cooperate more closely and spend more money on defense.",
      "The direct quotes below have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Poland - Professor Katarzyna Pisarska",
      "Chair, Warsaw Security Forum",
      "Speaking on Macron's comments:",
      "You have to remember that Macron's vision is not really a detail-oriented, ready-to-go project. It is an idea that has been discussed in Europe, and throughout the last two years, but the general direction is that we are not building anything that would be competitive to NATO. Rather, we would be creating capabilities, especially defense capabilities, that would help and strengthen the European defense pillar of NATO.",
      "The idea that we would go alone without the United States has been rejected by almost all, if not all, EU and NATO member states.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "Poland currently buys 80% of all its military stocks from the United States. It's heavily dependent on American air missile defense systems. These are not things that you can detangle or unbundle from overnight. So the majority of countries \u2014 especially from the NATO eastern flank \u2014 will tell you we will absolutely not go alone without the United States. There is no way that France, and even less so Germany, can step up to deliver the type of technological capabilities that are needed to substitute for the Americans on the ground here in Europe.",
      "Discussion has moved in the direction that it has been moving pre-Trump election: Europe has to step up with NATO, start producing more, start spending more, also developing its own capabilities. We also need to have a number of different defense elements that we procure and create by ourselves, and that should be also understandable to our American partners, although when I spoke with congressmen in April, not all of them understood that it is okay for Europeans to spend money on European equipment and not only on American or Korean equipment.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "Maybe President Emmanuel Macron has some idea since [the U.S. election] that he can yet again push the idea that European strategic autonomy is really complete independent from the United States. But I will say it again: From countries that are on the forefront of this war [in Ukraine], for countries that will have to be the first battleground of this war, which is the NATO eastern flank, that is not negotiable.",
      "We will have to do more and we will be doing more. I think what is unclear in the United States is that Europe already delivers 50% of military aid to Ukraine and 90% of financial and refugee aid to Ukraine. So stepping up has already happened to a large extent.",
      "It has to happen more. We need to have more troops. We have to be prepared to defend ourselves, but having America as an ally, not a competitor, I think this is what is very important to understand.",
      "U.K. - Alistair Burt",
      "Former Member of U.K. Parliament and minister of state for the Middle East at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and minister of state at the Department for International Development",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "We have known for some time that the United States, under whatever leadership, would be asking Europeans to spend more on their defense, and what Trump's election has done has catalyzed that now. I think you have to take people at their word, and what Trump has said about NATO in the past and what people have said about European defense, rings true. I think he's [Macron] making the point that in the end, it's up to us. You're either a supplicant or you're making the weather. And there's no reason why we should just roll over and take the world as President Trump is going to try and define it. It will still, I'm absolutely certain, be in the interests of the West to act together, but we cannot take that for granted any longer, and I think Macron is right to seize upon it.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "I noticed that Macron's speech sort of offered the invitation to those outside the EU to be part of this wider European political community that the United Kingdom has made very clear it intends to be part of. I think the United Kingdom does have a role to play in this. Clearly our military is a very important part of NATO and will always be, but I would very much believe it is in the United Kingdom's interest to act with the wider European community. It bolsters them, strengthens them, and it's in our own interests. We at least have begun to spend more on defense. Other states will have more catching up to do but I do see it in the U.K.'s political and economic and military interests to be active in relation to what Macron has been saying.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "All the rhetoric has been absolutely right, we cannot afford to let Russia win. You have the Baltic states very anxious, you have [countries] with Russian enclaves that could allow Putin to say, there are Russian people here, so we will defend their interests just as we purported to do in Ukraine. How would [those countries] feel if there was some sense that Ukraine was not being supported?",
      "On the other hand, if you take out the United States' economic and military support that is asking a great deal of the rest of us to make up. I think the rhetoric is very, very clear, in that everybody has said we will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, and there can't be any weakening in that. The moment you've got any possibility of that weakening, then you're effectively giving the game away.",
      "If there is to be some sort of U.S.-brokered negotiation [for Ukraine], clearly [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy wants to be in the strongest possible position. And to do that, he's got to be able to enter those negotiations with the clear determination of the rest of Europe behind him to say whatever happens, we won't let you down, but if it goes on for two, four, five years, who knows?",
      "I don't think Europe can say anything other than what it's saying, and again, I think you have to take us at our word.",
      "NATO - Gen. Sir Richard Shirreff",
      "Former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "Let's nail this for once and for all: There is one effective military alliance in Europe - a political-military alliance in Europe, in the trans-Atlantic region \u2014 and it's called NATO. NATO has a command structure. It has a doctrine. It practices regularly. It is used to moving and commanding military forces at real scale. What is the point of trying to create something where we've got 70 years, 75 years of experience with NATO? Now, of course, the problem is, what happens if America, under Trump, either pulls out of NATO, which is unlikely, or reduces its support to NATO, which is possible?",
      "The solution to that, frankly, is not to start blathering on about new formations under the European Union. It's to lean into NATO and damn well start spending money. Why is Trump and why are America likely to pull a rug from under NATO, if they do? Because the French, the Germans, the British, the Spanish, the Italians, have simply not pulled their weight in defense spending terms for most of the 75 years of NATO's existence, or certainly, at least the last, certainly the last 30 years. So, lean into NATO and really double down on NATO and double down on defense spending.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "There is one good thing, though, that the European Union can do, which is defense industries. If they can get a grip of European defense procurement in order to offset the current dependence on the Americans in order to standardize weaponry. It is ridiculous for the British to continue with its own cottage industry of making tanks, when actually the rest of Europe buys Leopard IIs, which is a perfectly good tank, from Rheinmetall [in Germany].",
      "This is going to require some real political boldness, and it is going to require a pooling and a sharing of sovereignty. It's going to require individual nations like Britain to say, okay, we're not going to make a tank. We'll buy the Leopard II.",
      "On NATO:",
      "If you start building large numbers of European [non-NATO] headquarters, they've got to come from somewhere - a European command structure. What it means is that NATO will suffer. You know, I was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, one of many Brits that go back to Montgomery. The Germans have the Chief of Staff. The Chairman of the Military Committee is a Dutchman at the moment, and he or she rotates the commanders of the joint force commands. Europe has a leading role in NATO. Europeans have leading roles in NATO. But it all comes down to really leaning in and being able to produce the troop numbers, the ships, the planes, that NATO needs to really provide an effective deterrence.",
      "Germany - Norbert Roetgen",
      "Former Chair, Bundestag (German parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "I think this definitely now is the hour of Europe, a European moment, when we have to prepare that, quite probably, America, under the Trump presidency, will stop any financial or military support for Ukraine. But perhaps we also are going to see the attempt to strike a deal between Trump and Putin, so this now means that European security definitely has to become European. So either we stand up or we give up.",
      "However, I think we, the Europeans, are not prepared, despite all the evidence that this had to be expected. Europeans are not prepared, so we have to quickly catch up. It's possible, and the political will is what is lacking most, but we will have to act in a very pragmatic way.",
      "On Ukraine:",
      "We have to act in a very pragmatic way to quickly and more substantially support Ukraine, and this means that we have to compensate for the American support in terms of weapons and ammunition delivery and, in the short term, this would mean that the Europeans would have to buy weapons and ammunition on the international market, and in the mid- and longer term we will have to enhance our capabilities to better coordinate, to create bigger markets in order to scale our economies in the area of defense.",
      "Up to now, there is no sufficient political will to do what is necessary to support Ukraine in order to enable Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression. Otherwise, the military situation on the battleground would be different. We are going to see that the United States is not contributing as they have done in the past, so there is a lack of political will, and there is only one way to change this course, and this is by doing more.",
      "This would mean that all European member states like Poland, Germany and France come together and invite other countries; for example, Britain\u2014 we should go beyond the EU because it's about the entire European architecture of security\u2014 come together. And when they come together, they should bring with them substantial additional contributions in terms of money and in terms of weapons and ammunition, and this should be done in the short term. And then they should devise a plan on how to make this a structured effort and what is necessary to be done to better coordinate, to enhance the support necessary for the defense of Ukraine. It should be done very substantially in terms of money and weapons. There are no further words needed. What is needed are deeds.",
      "On NATO:",
      "Of course, it's in the European strategic interest to be a strong part of NATO, to keep the Americans in Europe. This is not against anybody, but it is only to contribute in a stronger way to what is at the heart and what is the core of NATO, and that is European security.",
      "Italy - Natalie Tocci",
      "Director, Istituto Affari Internazionali, and former special adviser to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs",
      "On Macron's comments:",
      "He's been saying this for a long time, and in a sense the vision was right back then, and it's even more right now. He started talking about European strategic autonomy in 2017, and there wasn't a lot of appetite and traction behind the idea, given that it has traditionally been mistakenly interpreted as something that runs counter to the transatlantic relationship. So obviously now with Trump, a good idea that was good back then becomes politically relevant today.",
      "From the general concept of the idea to the action, there's a big gap, and he hasn't put forward any new concrete ideas in that respect.",
      "Generally what tends to happen is Macron says something, everyone else criticizes him, but no one really puts forward an alternative vision. So God bless Macron for at least kind of having an idea, and I think in this particular case it's even a good idea, and I do think that the election of Donald Trump is going to galvanize some action, but I'm very skeptical that the kind of action that is going to be insufficient relative to what we have to do.",
      "On defense spending:",
      "We're basically talking about 100 billion euros a year ($104 billion) for several years alongside all member states beginning to spend between 2-and-4% of GDP. This is not going to happen overnight.",
      "There's no antagonism between the EU and NATO, because, frankly speaking, as we're in the midst of a war, we can't really afford to have sort of academic conversations about the EU and NATO. What the EU can contribute is on providing the regulatory and financial incentives for Europeans to do more on defense together.",
      "However, I think there is a lot there to be worked on, and especially if some of these countries begin or increasingly pursue projects collectively. If you think about France, Italy on air defense, think about the Italian-German project on a new tank, there's a lot there that can be worked on.",
      "Does it mean that Europeans would have all defense capacities? Probably not, or certainly not in the short term, so there's still a lot of dependence on the US and US defense industry.",
      "This is not a question of just completely being self-reliant on your own defense industry, but certainly there's a lot more the European defense industry can do and a lot more that governments can do to support that consolidation and cooperation within the defense industry in Europe.",

      "Mittens, 8, was booked for one-way travel with her family from Christchurch, New Zealand to their new home in Melbourne, Australia on Jan. 13. But owner Margo Neas said Wednesday that as she waited for Mittens to be unloaded from the plane's freight area, three hours passed with no sign of the cat.",
      "It was then that ground staff told Neas the plane had returned to New Zealand \u2014 with Mittens still on board. The return trip involves about 7.5 hours in the air.",
      "\"I said, how can this happen? How can this happen? Oh my God,\" Neas said.",

      "Islamabad, Pakistan \u2014 A prisoner swap between the United States and Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime saw two Americans freed in exchange for a Taliban figure imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement, the family of Ryan Corbett, an American man held by the Taliban since the summer of 2022, said he was released as part of the deal.",
      "The Taliban-run Afghan Foreign Ministry announced the swap, saying two U.S. citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008 in the U.S. The Taliban did not identify the Americans being released in the deal.",
      "Corbett, who lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the U.S.-backed government, was abducted by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip.",
      "The deal, the terms of which were not immediately confirmed by U.S. officials, came as former President Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, handed power over to returning President Trump. Members of Corbett's family were on stage Monday with Mr. Trump during his Inaugural Parade at Washington's Capital One Arena, along with family members of\u00a0Israeli hostages\u00a0held in Gaza.",
      "Corbett was considered by the U.S. government to have been wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and talks were underway in the final days of the Biden administration for a trade but had fallen through.",
      "The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the \"normalization\" of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan, but that likely remains a tall order as most countries in the world still don't recognize the militants' rule.",
      "\"Our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,\" the Corbett family said in their statement. They thanked both Mr. Trump and Biden, as well as many officials of both administrations, for their efforts in freeing him.",
      "Corbett's family also praised the Middle East nation of Qatar for its \"vital role in facilitating Ryan's release, and for their visits to Ryan as the United States' Protecting Power in Afghanistan.\"",
      "Energy-rich Qatar, which has hosted negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban over the years, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",

The source told CBS News that the UAE and Qatar had played a role in the prisoner exchange. No other details have emerged about McKenty, or what he might have been doing in Afghanistan.",

      "Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Last week,\u00a0Biden spoke with relatives of the three Americans\u00a0though there was no deal to get them back at that time, family members said.",
      "Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban has denied that it has Habibi.",
      "In a statement released Tuesday by the family of Mahmood Habibi, one of the detained man's brothers, Ahmad Habibi, said they were \"grateful that Ryan and William will be reunited with their families,\" and that they were \"confident that the Trump Administration will make a greater effort to bringing home my brother.\"",
      "\"We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him. My brother is an innocent man who has been held away from his wife, young daughter, and elderly parents for over two years,\" said Ahmad Habibi, adding that his family had been \"frustrated\" by the Biden administration's efforts to free his brother.",
      "\"It was our hope that Ryan, George and Mahmoud would be returned to their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good fortune will bring them,\" the Corbett family said. \"We recognize the immense privilege of our family's reunion today, and pledge to keep praying \u2014 and fighting \u2014 for George and Mahmoud's swift release.\"",
      "Brian Hughes, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement, \"We celebrate the release of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty who will soon reunited with their families and loved ones, and also thank the Government of Qatar for their assistance.

      "Reaction to Trump announcement on U.S. withdrawal from WHO",
      "The WHO is the United Nations agency responsible for global public health. It has nearly 200 member states and plays a lead role in coordinating international responses to disease outbreaks and other health matters. Mr. Trump's announcement started a year-long notice period for the U.S. to formally withdraw from the WHO and halt all financial contributions to the body.",
      "Speaking Monday, Mr. Trump accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, saying the agency had failed to act free of \"inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\" and had required \"unfairly onerous payments\" from the U.S., disproportionate to what some other, larger countries, such as China, were paying.",
      "\"The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,\" Tedros said. \"We hope the United States will reconsider and we look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue to maintain the partnership between the USA and WHO, for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Germany's health minister as saying Tuesday that Berlin would try to convince Mr. Trump to change his mind on the WHO, while China's foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters \"the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.\"",
      "\"China will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said, according to the AFP news agency, adding that Beijing would \"work towards building a shared community of health for humanity.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump saying U.S. will pull out of Paris Climate Accords",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's announcement that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 a move that will take a year to complete and that he initiated during his first term, too \u2014 U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said anyone not embracing clean energy would miss out on \"massive profits, millions of manufacturing jobs and clean air.\"",
      "The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty to address climate change that was adopted by 196 parties in 2015.

      "\"Such a move is in clear defiance of scientific realities and shows an administration cruelly indifferent to the harsh climate change impacts that people in the United States and around the world are experiencing. Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is an abdication of responsibility and undermines the very global action that people at home and abroad desperately need,\" she said in a statement.",

      "The withdrawal process from the Paris accord takes one year. Trump's previous withdrawal took effect the day after the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.",
      "While the first Trump-led withdrawal from the landmark U.N. agreement \u2014 adopted by 196 nations \u2014 shocked and angered nations across the globe, \"not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,\" said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G.",
      "Instead, other nations renewed their commitment to slowing climate change, along with investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others in the U.S., Meyer and other experts said.",
      "Still, they lamented the loss of U.S. leadership in global efforts to slow climate change, even as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire.",
      "\"Clearly America is not going to play the commanding role in helping solve the climate crisis, the greatest dilemma humans have ever encountered,\" said climate activist and writer Bill McKibben. \"For the next few years the best we can hope is that Washington won't manage to wreck the efforts of others.\"",
      "About half of Americans \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" oppose U.S. action to withdraw from the climate accord, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly in favor, according according to a poll\u00a0from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" in favor of withdrawing from the Paris agreement, while about one-quarter are neutral.",
      "Much of the opposition to U.S. withdrawal comes from Democrats, but Republicans display some ambivalence as well. Slightly less than half of Republicans are in favor of withdrawing from the climate accord, while about 2 in 10 are opposed.",
      "China several years ago passed the United States as the world's largest annual carbon dioxide emitting nation. The U.S. \u2014 the second biggest annual carbon polluting country \u2014 put 4.9 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in the air in 2023, down 11% from a decade earlier, according to the scientists who track emissions for the Global Carbon Project.",
      "But carbon dioxide lasts in the atmosphere for centuries, so the United States has put more of the heat-trapping gas that is now in the air than any other nation. The U.S. is responsible for nearly 22% of the carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere since 1950, according to Global Carbon Project.",
      "While global efforts to fight climate change continued during Trump's first term, many experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries, especially China, could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions.",
      "Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate change executive secretary, held out hope that the U.S. would continue to embrace the global clean energy boom.",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse,\" Stiell said. \"The door remains open to the Paris Agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries.\"",

Or, it could be implied that senators who plan to deploy either option. Thus, the Senate Majority Leader gets the joke. He knows he must \"file cloture\" to terminate the \"filibuster.\"",
      "Democrats appear dug in on Ratcliffe. So Thune took the procedural step of filing cloture petitions to overcome a filibuster on the the Ratcliffe nomination, but also for Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary nominee Kristi Noem.",
      "By rule, once cloture is filed, it must \"ripen\" for a day before the Senate may consider it. Thune filed cloture on Ratcliffe Tuesday. Therefore Wednesday serves as the intervening day. The Senate could vote to break the filibuster one hour after the Senate meets on Thursday at 10 am et. By rule, the cloture vote can begin at 11 am et. That will only need 51 yeas to break the filibuster.",
      "SECOND ACTS: PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES HISTORIC COMEBACK",
      "CIA Director is not recognized as a full-level cabinet position. So the \"post cloture\" time is limited to only two hours \u2013 not the full 30 hours of debate allowed for all cabinet level slots.",
      "Thus, if the Senate breaks the filibuster on Thursday, a vote to confirm Ratcliffe as CIA Director could come just two hours later. Confirmation only needs 51 votes.",

      "So let\u2019s say the Senate clears the filibuster on Ratcliffe by late morning. It debates his nomination for a couple of hours. That means the Senate could vote by 3 or 4 p.m. ET to confirm Ratcliffe.",
      "Once Ratcliffe is confirmed, Hegseth is next. The Senate could then vote to break the filibuster on Hegseth on Thursday afternoon.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. All have played their cards close to the vest as to their opinions on Hegseth. If they vote nay, Vice President Vance could need to come to the Capitol to break the tie and confirm Hegseth as Defense Secretary.",

If that vote comes late Friday/early Saturday, the Senate could vote to confirm Noem midday Sunday if they burn all time.

      "Directly after he was sworn in on Monday, Trump moved quickly to revoke a long list of Biden executive orders covering a wide range of issues. Two of the orders that were revoked included efforts by Biden to expand access to the ACA and restore the federal program \"to the way it was before Trump became president\" the first time around.",

      "Shortly after taking office in January 2021, Biden passed Executive Order 14009, titled the \"Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\" The move, which Trump rescinded as part of his Day One executive actions, doubled the window of time that uninsured Americans had to apply to participate in the federal insurance program.

The April order from Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to analyze new policies aimed at \"exploring how medical debts are collected from beneficiaries,\" in order to find new ways to reduce \"the burden of medical debt on working families and individuals across the country.\"",
      "Consistent with both of these orders, agencies facilitated the expansion of the ACA through new eligibility provisions, increased funding to groups that help people sign up for the ACA, and more.",
      "Other changes enacted by Trump during his first days in office included the revocation of a Biden-era policy that directed Medicare and Medicaid to investigate how to lower drug costs. In response to that order, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a $2 cap for certain generic drugs, ensured Medicare beneficiaries did not overpay for drugs that received accelerated approval, and helped state Medicaid programs pay for certain high-cost, cutting-edge therapies. Biden's policy that capped insulin costs at $35 and implemented a $2,000 out-of-pocket maximum for prescription drug costs went unaffected by Trump's Day One orders.",

A reboot loop can be caused by an issue with your computer's power supply, a malware infection, overheating or even hardware drivers. Here are the different things to check if your Windows 11 laptop or desktop keeps restarting.",
      "Fix #1 - Boot your PC in safe mode",
      "Step to boot your PC in safe mode (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When you are troubleshooting any problem on your PC, you should boot your computer in safe mode. If your PC is in safe mode and no longer experiences the restart loop, this means that the default Windows 11 settings and drivers aren't causing the issue. This allows you to narrow down the sources of problems causing your Windows 11 PC to crash, making it easier to troubleshoot. Here's what you need to do to boot in safe mode:",

      "WINDOWS 11 TIPS AND TRICKS YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU NEEDED",
      "Fix #2 - Remove any new software",
      "If your automatic rebooting problem began after installing a new app, uninstall that app and monitor your PC. If you still notice your PC restarting, there's a chance that the app has infected your system settings before you uninstalled it. To fix this, you'll need to restore the system. To do a system restore, you should first boot your PC in safe mode and then follow these steps:",

      "Fix #3 - Make sure your computer isn't overheating",
      "An overheating laptop or desktop will try to prevent damage to critical hardware components by shutting itself down. This is one of the leading causes of a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a restart loop. If you've noticed your desktop giving off a lot more heat than usual or a laptop feeling hot to the touch, chances are you have an overheating issue.",
      "A computer's CPU and GPU generate the most heat, so I recommend monitoring those hardware pieces to see if they are overheating. You don't need any additional software to monitor the temperatures of your GPU, as some temperature readings are built into Windows 11. Here's how to check your hardware temperatures in Windows 11:",

      "Unfortunately, the built-in temperature reading doesn't read your CPU temperature, and you'll need to manually go into the UEFI/BIOS to check the temperature without installing any additional software. However, there's a multitude of free-to-use apps that manufacturers have developed to measure your CPU temperature, including Core Temp, HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor.",
      "When you open one of these monitoring tools, you'll be able to view your PC's stats, including CPU and GPU temperatures and loads. If your CPU or GPU is running too hot, try cleaning the components to remove dust. For custom-built desktops, adding more exhaust fans to the case can improve airflow and cooling. Persistent overheating, especially in older laptops, may indicate that it's time to consider upgrading your machine.",

      "Fix #4 - Check for issues with your PC's power supply",
      "Image of a PC\u2019s power supply (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A computer will randomly restart when it has a failing power supply unit (PSU). If you have an issue with your power supply, you'll know if your computer won't restart or turn on. In addition to causing shut-offs and restart loops, a faulty power supply can also cause a blue screen of death error. In severe cases, you might even smell a burning scent or witness smoke coming from your PC's power supply exhaust vent. If you use a laptop with PSU issues, you cannot send your computer to a repair shop or the manufacturer for repair.",
      "Desktop PC owners have it a bit easier, assuming they have a pre-built PC that can be altered easily. If you do have a desktop, turn off and unplug your computer before going into the case to investigate if dust build-up is affecting your PSU. If your PSU fails, you must purchase and install a new one.",

      "Fix #6 - Disable automatic restart",
      "Step to disable automatic restart (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "If you have automatic restart enabled in Windows 11, your PC will restart every time it encounters a system failure. You can easily disable this future within the Windows 11 command prompt. Here's what you need to do:",

      "Fix #7 - Repair your system files",
      "Step to repair your system files (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "An issue with your Windows 11 system files may be causing your PC to constantly restart. If you think a corrupted system file is why your PC keeps restarting, there's a quick and easy fix you can do within the Windows Powershell. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool that will scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a system file has been modified, it will automatically replace the file with the correct version. Here's how to run the SFC command:",
      "Open the Windows Powershell\u00a0(or Command Prompt)Type in sfc /scannowPress EnterLeave the command prompt window open until the command completes, which could take some time",
      "Open the Windows Powershell\u00a0(or Command Prompt)",
      "Type in sfc /scannow",
      "Press Enter",
      "Leave the command prompt window open until the command completes, which could take some time",
      "If there's no problem with your Windows system files, after the scan, you'll see a message that says, \"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.\" If you instead see a message saying, \"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them,\" you should try running SFC again but in safe mode.",
      "Fix #8 - Check for RAM issues in the command prompt",
      "Your PC might be restarting itself because it doesn't have access to enough random access memory (RAM). Windows 11 may become unstable without enough RAM in your computer, causing the OS to randomly reboot. You can use the built-in Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 11 to check your computer for issues related to RAM. Here's what you need to do:",
      "Press the Windows Key\u00a0and RType mdsched.exe in the text boxClick OKSelect Restart Now and Check for Problems",
      "Press the Windows Key\u00a0and R",

      "When your PC restarts, the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool will check for any RAM-related issues; if the test detects an error, take note of the error code. You can check the error code online to find the correct fix for that specific error.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These are the best fixes for a computer that is constantly restarting. While you can perform these fixes at home, it might be your best bet to send your computer to a repair shop or back to the manufacturer if you continue having an issue with your Windows 11 PC being stuck in a restart loop after these fixes. It also may be time to invest in a new laptop if you are experiencing a system slowdown and random restarting on your Windows 11 PC, but I would recommend trying to fix the problem first before buying a new machine.",

      "1. Check if you applied for the job: If you receive an unsolicited interview invitation, think back to whether you actually applied for that job or company. Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",
      "5. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Use strong antivirus or endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious downloads. Regularly update your security tools to ensure they can handle new threats effectively.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

While this particular scam is more focused on using your computer\u2019s resources than stealing data, it is still very dangerous. It shows that if a hacker can easily install software on your PC, they can also go ahead and steal your financial information and other personal data.

The director of the hospital, Hussam Abu Safiya, the Israelis claim, had gathered intelligence showing that he not only allowed Hamas to infiltrate the hospital, but actively collaborated with the terror group.",
      "Another captured terrorist, Anas Muhammad Faiz al-Sharif, who worked at the hospital as a cleaning supervisor and joined the Nukhba forces of Hamas\u2019s Al-Qassam Brigades in 2021, told Israeli interrogators that the northern Gaza facility was viewed as \"a safe haven for them because the [Israeli] military cannot directly target it.\"",

They must not be used for military purposes. They must be protected at all times. The point is both to protect civilians, as well as to protect the health systems and infrastructure that communities depend on for life-giving care and continuity of services.",

The aim of the campaign was to completely defeat Hamas's Northern Brigade and remove the terror group's presence from within the civilian population. IDF troops conducted raids ranging from a few hours up to a full day. During the longer ones, they entered the hospital and searched for weapons and terrorists.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senators on both sides of the aisle raised new questions on Wednesday about the vetting process for Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, pointing to allegations that were not disclosed by the Trump transition team as part of Hegseth\u2019s FBI background check that was transmitted to two key lawmakers ahead of his confirmation hearing.",
      "Those questions come a day after Danielle Hegseth, Pete Hegseth\u2019s former sister-in-law, said in a sworn affidavit that Pete made his ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth, \u201cfear for her safety\u201d while they were married. The affidavit was submitted in response to a request for information sent by Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "Danielle Hegseth said in the affidavit, the existence of which was first reported by NBC News, that she had provided the information in the affidavit to the FBI over the course of two conversations since December, including one on Saturday. The information she provided in the first conversation was not relayed by the Trump team to the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which held the confirmation hearing. The second conversation occurred after the hearing.",
      "In response to a previous request for comment from NBC News, Samantha Hegseth said, \u201cThere was no physical abuse in my marriage. This is the only further statement I will make to you, I have let you know that I am not speaking and will not speak on my marriage to Pete. Please respect this decision.\u201d",
      "Among the allegations are that Samantha once hid from Hegseth in a closet, that she developed escape plans \u201cif she felt she needed to get away from Hegseth\u201d that would be activated with a code word, and that she did once put the escape plans into action.",
      "An unredacted version of the affidavit has now been viewed by more than 20 senators, including several Republicans, according to two people with knowledge of the process. A copy of the unredacted affidavit has been made available to all senators. According to two people who have viewed the unredacted affidavit filed by Danielle Hegseth, and recounted it to NBC News, it contains a previously unreported allegation.",
      "\u201cAs I told the FBI, Samantha once told me that Hegseth grabbed her groin without consent at their home. Samantha told me about this sometime during the years between 2014-2016,\u201d Danielle Hegseth says in the affidavit. \u201cI believe what Samantha told me because what she told me is consistent with what I personally observed of Hegseth\u2019s erratic and aggressive behavior over many years.\u201d",
      "Danielle Hegseth also notes in the affidavit that this \u201coccurred in the privacy of [Samantha and Pete Hegseth\u2019s] home and I did not personally witness physical or sexual abuse by Hegseth.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Samantha Hegseth did not respond to a request for comment on this previously unreported allegation.",
      "Asked for comment on this allegation, Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Pete Hegseth, said in an email, \u201cAs NBC is well aware, the actual participant, Samantha has denied these false allegations, yet NBC continues to irresponsibly report false allegations by an uninvolved third party as if they were fact.\u201d",
      "Senators' concerns",
      "Asked on Wednesday whether she was concerned that the FBI background check into Pete Hegseth provided by the Trump transition was incomplete, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, replied, \u201cI am.\u201d",
      "Collins\u2019 office told NBC News the senator had not seen the unredacted copy of the affidavit, which contains the previously unreported allegation.",
      "\u201cLet me say that because I\u2019m not a member of the [Armed Services Committee], I\u2019ve not seen the FBI background check, but I\u2019ve heard from others that pertinent information has not been included, and that is troubling,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBecause when you\u2019re making a decision on a nominee you want to have as complete a picture as possible.\u201d",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who viewed the unredacted affidavit on Tuesday afternoon when it first became available to senators, said Wednesday he was not previously aware that the Trump transition, and not the FBI, sets the parameters around what material from a nominee\u2019s background check is presented to the top two senators on the committee considering the nomination. In any transition or administration, the scope and timing of a background check are set not by the FBI but by the organization requesting it for a nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking into it to see procedurally, if that, if that\u2019s how it\u2019s done,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cAnd then trying to just figure out: Is that an aberration? Or is that how it\u2019s been done between Democrat and Republican members? Don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Tillis revealed that he sought to \u201ccorroborate\u201d Danielle Hegseth\u2019s allegations because he spoke to other witnesses with their own \u201cinteresting accounts\u201d of experiences with Pete Hegseth.",
      "He also suggested he was still undecided on Hegseth after voting \u2014 along with all other Republican senators \u2014 to move forward with Hegseth\u2019s nomination on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m interested in anything until the final vote. I voted on the motion to proceed last night, but I\u2019ve made it very clear to the administration, my colleagues, that I treat every one of these pieces of information with respect, the would-be witnesses with respect. I\u2019ve just got to confirm facts and corroborate,\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI told NBC News on Wednesday that the bureau \u201cdoes not comment on specific background investigations.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the FBI said, \u201cBeing completed as expeditiously as possible, the background investigation focuses on character and conduct. The FBI serves as an investigative service provider and does not adjudicate or render an opinion on the results of the background investigation. The FBI\u2019s role is purely fact-finding. Once the investigation is complete, the report is sent to the Office of White House Counsel or the Office of the President-Elect for their use as deemed appropriate.\u201d",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a member of the Armed Services Committee who announced she would support Hegseth\u2019s nomination hours after his confirmation hearing last Tuesday, told NBC News on Wednesday \u201cthe FBI has done their job\u201d when asked about the allegations contained in the document.",
      "\u201cThe ex-wife has denied the allegations. ...  I think we need to take her at her word,\u201d Ernst said.",
      "Samantha and Pete Hegseth, who have three children together, both signed a court document in 2021 that said neither claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s attorney Parlatore said he was in contact with Samantha Hegseth around the time she provided a statement to NBC News on Tuesday afternoon, just prior to NBC News\u2019 publication of a story revealing the existence of the affidavit.",
      "In a response to a request for comment and additional questions sent to him by NBC News Tuesday afternoon, Parlatore emailed: \u201cWe have just communicated with Pete\u2019s ex-wife ... she will be emailing you shortly, CC\u2019ing Pete, and will make clear that there was never any abuse.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Parlatore sent a letter to Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, urging that Wicker \u201creject\u201d Danielle Hegseth\u2019s sworn affidavit and instead \u201crely upon the Minnesota Court records and the FBI\u2019s findings\u201d to \u201cmove forward to confirm\u201d Hegseth. The letter was first reported by Punchbowl News.",
      "Wicker told reporters later in the day that to him the affidavit \u201cessentially doesn\u2019t change much.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the nomination is going to go forward,\u201d he added. \u201cAre you asking if I am inclined to move from a yes vote? My answer is that I\u2019m still a firm yes.\u201d",
      "A final vote on Hegseth\u2019s nomination could take place by the weekend. A simple majority, or 51 out of 100, is required for confirmation in the Senate, where Republicans have a four-vote margin."

      "In today\u2019s edition, Sahil Kapur examines how votes today on two hot-button issues provide a sense of how the Democratic Party is handling the second Trump presidency. Speaking of, the new administration was busy once again \u2014 we break down the top lines from Day 3. And Ben Kamisar takes stock of what comes next for JD Vance\u2019s and Marco Rubio\u2019s replacements in the Senate.",

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Democrats are breaking up with the left on immigration \u2014 but not on abortion",
      "Congressional Republican leaders brought up two bills this week on hot-button issues. Democrats embraced one and rejected the other, providing a glimpse into how they will approach the second Donald Trump presidency.",
      "One of them, the Laken Riley Act, which aims to crack down on undocumented immigrants who commit nonviolent crimes, is about to become law. The House passed it on Wednesday with the support of 46 Democrats after the Senate approved it earlier this week with the votes of 12 Democrats. It\u2019s now on track to be the first major bill Trump signs in his new term.",
      "The other Republican-led bill, which would impose penalties on health care providers who fail to provide care for children in the event of a failed abortion, was voted down in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition in the Senate on Wednesday. The party-line vote of 52-47 fell short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster.",
      "The Democrats who supported the Laken Riley Act \u2014 most of them in swing states or districts \u2014 defied progressives and immigration advocates who warned that the bill would strip away due process for migrants and empower right-wing state prosecutors to shape federal enforcement.",
      "Asked what caused the Democratic shift on immigration, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said: \u201cA blinding flash of common sense.\u201d",
      "But on the abortion measure, Democrats gave the GOP no quarter, a sign that the party remains confident in their political stance and ready to fight for it.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s vote on Senate Republicans\u2019 so-called \u2018born alive\u2019 bill makes one thing clear: under President Trump, it will be a golden age, but for the extreme, anti-choice movement,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday.",
      "The reason for the split-screen can be found in the 2024 presidential election results. According to NBC News exit polls, voters trusted Trump to handle immigration, but trusted Kamala Harris on abortion. The two issues ranked similarly highly for voters, but those who listed immigration as their top issue voted 89%-9% for Trump, while those who prioritized abortion voted 76-24% for Harris.",

For Strange, the appointment ultimately backfired politically, souring him in the eyes of Republican voters who preferred a more hardline conservative. Despite Trump\u2019s endorsement of Strange, he went on to lose the GOP primary.",
      "Loeffler and McSally also found that their incumbent status was not powerful enough to dampen intraparty tensions \u2014 the former had to fend off a Republican challenger and the latter continued to face pressure about her conservative bonafides and about her appointment. Both lost difficult general elections.",
      "And the circumstances of Carnahan\u2019s appointment were unique. Her husband won the 2000 Senate election even though he had died less than a month before Election Day, leading to her appointment, which was her first foray into elected office. She narrowly lost in 2002 in a difficult year for her party.\u00a0(Montana Democratic Sen. John Walsh initially sought a full term in 2014 after his appointment, but dropped out amid a plagiarism scandal.)",

      "In Florida, Rep. Cory Mills is already telegraphing a potential primary bid against Moody, questioning whether she\u2019s more loyal to Gov. Ron DeSantis (who appointed her) or Donald Trump. And while the energy in Ohio is more focused on the open governor\u2019s race, it\u2019s possible that someone from the state\u2019s deep GOP bench (including those who have run in the Senate primaries before) decides to jump in.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 23:27:46 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump signed more executive orders aimed at shutting down the southern border, but the details on how migrants would be blocked from crossing remain unclear.",
    "story": [
      "In his third day in office, President Donald Trump signed more executive orders aimed at shutting down the U.S. southern border to immigration and ramping up deportations \u2014\u00a0though large scale deportation raids had yet to materialize as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "According to a fact sheet released by the White House, Trump signed an executive order that \u201csuspends the physical entry of aliens engaged in an invasion of the United States through the southern border.\u201d",
      "The order directs the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and State to \u201ctake all necessary action to immediately repel, repatriate and remove illegal aliens across the southern border of the United States.\u201d",
      "But the details of how Trump will block migrants attempting to cross remain unclear.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News that Trump is \u201cusing every lever of his executive power to secure our nation\u2019s borders.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cports of entry are the places to be processed and to apply to come into this country,\u201d and indicated Trump would allow ports of entry to remain open to asylum-seekers.",
      "However, the CBP One app, which was previously used by migrants to submit their information and schedule appointments at southwest border ports of entry, stopped working for that purpose in the immediate hours after Trump took office. Existing appointments scheduled through the app were canceled, according to a statement posted on the Customs and Border Protection website Monday.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Trump administration published in the federal register a notice to expand \u201cexpedited removal\u201d \u2014 which allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport migrants without due process \u2014 to any undocumented immigrants who have crossed the border within the last two years. The federal register logs regulatory changes made by the federal government.",
      "Previously, the Biden administration applied expedited removal to recent arrivals who did not qualify for asylum when they crossed the southern border. Now, the Trump administration will be able to deport any migrants who have been in the United States for less than two years, regardless of where they are encountered in the country, and without giving them a day in immigration court to make their claim.",
      "The new order could speed up Trump\u2019s ability to deport migrants by bypassing immigration courts, which are currently saddled with a backlog of 3 million cases.",
      "The Trump administration fired four top officials at the Justice Department\u2019s Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, late Monday. The four fired officials had decades of experience leading the nation\u2019s overburdened immigration courts. The Justice Department employs more than 700\u00a0immigration judges, who decide whether migrants seeking asylum in the United States can remain in the country legally.",
      "As of Wednesday evening, deportations did not appear to have drastically increased. Border czar Tom Homan said on Fox News on Wednesday morning that ICE agents had arrested 308 migrants over the past 24 hours. In September, the latest month for which ICE data is available, 282 migrants were arrested by the agency on average per day.",
      "A source familiar with the recent arrests said they were part of \u201croutine operations\u201d across the United States.",
      "While the arrests targeted immigrants with criminal records, the source could not confirm whether migrants without criminal records would be arrested as \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d because they were found in the same area."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:01:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni was on the hot seat earlier this year. Now he's one win away from the Super Bowl.",
    "story": [
      "Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni has the best winning percentage of any coach in franchise history (.702). He's led the Eagles to the playoffs in each of his four seasons, including a Super Bowl appearance in his second.",
      "And now, Sirianni has Philadelphia on the doorstep of a second Super Bowl berth, something no other coach in the team\u2019s history has done.",
      "Yet only a few months ago, despite this success, Sirianni appeared more likely to lose his job then lead the team on another deep playoff run.",
      "Questions around his job security began at the end of last season. The Eagles started 10-1, a nice bounce back from its Super Bowl loss to the Kansas City Chiefs a season before. But they ended the 2023 campaign 1-6, including a lopsided first-round playoff loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Philadelphia brought back Sirianni amid murmurs about his job status, and that conversation became more audible after the Eagles started the season 2-2.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to hire a grown-up,\u201d opined Fox Sports\u2019s Colin Cowherd in early October.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a shocker if Sirianni quickly found himself as the guy next to Saleh on the unemployment line,\u201d wrote USA Today\u2019s Nate Davis, referring to Robert Saleh, who was fired as coach of the New York Jets midseason.",
      "Sirianni himself didn\u2019t help matters when he argued with Philadelphia fans from the sideline toward the end of a listless win over the Cleveland Browns on Oct. 13.",
      "On top of all of this, Sirianni reportedly had a strained relationship with quarterback Jalen Hurts, something the two tried to hash out during the team\u2019s bye week this season.",
      "The warning signs were obvious that Sirianni\u2019s days with the Eagles could be numbered. An embarrassing finish last season, public calls for his firing, a tenuous relationship with the team\u2019s star quarterback, arguing with fans \u2014 all true.",
      "But Sirianni then did the one thing that can cure all those ailments at once: He kept winning.",
      "After their sluggish start, the Eagles dominated the rest of the regular season, finishing 12-1. (Their lone loss came on the road by 3 points to the Washington Commanders, a game Hurts left early because of a concussion.)",
      "Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley, a free-agent addition, spearheaded the league\u2019s second-best rushing attack, carrying the team to the NFC East title. And the defense, in its first season under veteran coordinator Vic Fangio, led the NFL in yards allowed per game.",
      "Now, Sirianni\u2019s team is on the precipice of a second Super Bowl appearance in three seasons. Philadelphia will be favored to advance against a young, up-and-coming Commanders team. The last time these teams faced off in Philly, the Eagles won, 26-18. Barkey rushed for 146 yards and two scores, while Washington was held to 264 yards.",
      "Sirianni couldn\u2019t avoid the noise surrounding his job during the season but, to his credit, he seemingly didn\u2019t let it affect him.",
      "\u201cYou obviously hear it,\u00a0you gotta prepare for media, and I gotta do questions,\u201d Sirianni told Sports Illustrated\u2019s Albert Breer in December. \u201cBut I also gotta practice what I preach. And if I\u2019m gonna tell these guys not to listen, when the word is out that we\u2019re not any good, or the word\u2019s out that we\u2019re really good, then I need to do the same thing. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve tried to do. \u2026 My job is to lead this football team, along with the captains and the leaders we have, and put my head down and go to work.\u201d",
      "Has Sirianni earned more patience moving forward? It\u2019s not so simple.",
      "It was Philadelphia, after all, that fired head coach Doug Pederson only three seasons after he won the only Super Bowl in franchise history. (Pederson was hired off the staff of Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, who the Eagles let go after the 2012 season.)",
      "It\u2019s not impossible another poor stretch or more tension with Hurts could both become issues for Sirianni again in the future. But it would be hard for Philadelphia, or any team, to find a coach who wins as much as Sirianni does."

    "summary": "Who will \u201csave\u201d TikTok? YouTuber MrBeast, X owner Elon Musk and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison have been floated as potential buyers of the app in the past week.",
    "story": [
      "Who will \u201csave\u201d TikTok? YouTube star MrBeast is among several wealthy figures who want to.",
      "\u201cTikTok, I\u2019m on a private jet right now about to put in my official offer for this platform,\u201d Jimmy Donaldson, better known on the internet as the creator MrBeast, said in a video Monday. \u201cI might become your guys\u2019 new CEO.\u201d",
      "Donaldson is one of a handful of people who have said they are interested in acquiring the app in a bid to satisfy a U.S. law that requires TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell it. But he, like others who are interested, would most likely have to pull together co-investors to come up with the funds.",
      "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was interested in Elon Musk or Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying it. Billionaire Frank McCourt's Project Liberty also created a consortium called \u201cThe People\u2019s Bid,\u201d which said it put an offer on the table.",
      "The possibility of a TikTok sale once seemed remote. But in recent days, the idea has gained fresh momentum. Trump signed an executive order Monday giving ByteDance a 75-day extension to sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner, effectively delaying the nationwide ban of the app that was originally set to take effect Sunday. The app\u2019s U.S. operations have been valued at up to $50 billion if ByteDance does sell.",
      "Just hours before Trump signed the order Monday, China indicated that it might be softening its opposition to a sale. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry, expressed a willingness to allow ByteDance to sell at least part of the company. General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, who is a major investor in ByteDance and is on its board of directors, told Axios on Wednesday that a deal will get done and that there could be solutions \u201cshort of [ByteDance\u2019s] divestiture.\u201d",
      "Because of this shift, the big question is now about who or what will buy TikTok and not whether ByteDance will sell it, some experts say. Still, it will be complicated. People have also expressed concerns over how a sale might affect TikTok\u2019s unique algorithm, which is known for its ability to curate highly personalized feeds and may be hard to replicate by a new owner.",
      "\u201cWhat happens to the algorithm? Will this be an outright sale or a JV/partnership structure?\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst for the financial services firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in an analyst note Wednesday. \u201cOur view is ByteDance is willing to play ball and look for a legitimate deal/JV partner to keep TikTok up and running while protecting its algorithm. From the beginning we have only seen a few core potential bidders for the TikTok asset that would be \u2018approved\u2019 by Beijing.\u201d",
      "Trump has proposed the idea of a joint venture that produces a 50-50 ownership split between ByteDance and the United States, although it\u2019s unclear whether he means ownership by the U.S. government or a U.S. company. For now, however, the law would still require ByteDance to give up at least 80% of its stake.",
      "Over the weekend, TikTok went dark for less than a day before coming back online, in both instances crediting Trump\u2019s efforts to work with the company on \u201ca solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office.\u201d",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, TikTok is still not available for redownload on the Apple and Google app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials were considering the possibility of selling TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to Musk \u2014 particularly as Beijing evaluates how China can work with the new Trump administration. Musk has been appointed to helm the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to Bloomberg\u2019s report, one possibility under Musk might be some kind of merger between X (formerly Twitter), which he bought for $44 billion in 2022, and TikTok.",
      "But ByteDance has denied the report, responding to several news outlets: \u201cWe can\u2019t be expected to comment on pure fiction.\u201d",
      "Representatives for TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has not addressed the rumors \u2014 but he has posted several times on X that the ban would contradict freedom of speech.",
      "\u201cThis law is not just about TikTok, it is about censorship and government control!\u201d Musk wrote on X in March in response to concerns about the scope of the law. \u201cIf it were just about TikTok, it would only cite \u2018foreign control\u2019 as the issue, but it does not.\u201d",
      "Musk, who has extensive business interests in China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Ives, one of the most prominent analysts in the tech industry, wrote that he believes Musk is the most likely person to be leading a successful bid for the app, citing his \u201ciron clad relationship with Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u200b\u200bWe continue to believe Musk will be heavily involved in finding a solution for TikTok and ultimately could build a consortium to buy TikTok,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOther strategic/financial players are looking at this golden asset, but it needs to be formally approved by Beijing and will never be sold with the algorithm in our view.\u201d",
      "Ives added that Ellison and his company, Oracle, could also still play a pivotal role.",
      "Oracle is one of TikTok\u2019s most vital service providers, managing and storing user data.",
      "Ellison has been a vocal and financial supporter of Republican causes, including hosting fundraisers for Trump during the 2016 election cycle. On Tuesday, the two men appeared together at a news conference to unveil a new venture backed by the White House: Stargate, a partnership between Oracle, OpenAI and Japanese investment holding company SoftBank, focused on powering artificial intelligence production.",
      "During that appearance, after Trump floated Musk or Ellison as prospective buyers for TikTok, Ellison responded, \u201cSounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President.\u201d",
      "Steven Mnuchin, who served as treasury secretary during Trump\u2019s first term, has also expressed a personal interest in purchasing TikTok.",
      "In 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban TikTok due to national security concerns, then-Secretary Mnuchin oversaw the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which was tasked with evaluating the risks associated with the app. He facilitated negotiations and conversations with potential bidders, a process that came to an end when TikTok won a court appeal and the ban was halted.",
      "In March, Mnuchin told CNBC that he was putting together an investor group to \u201cbuy TikTok,\u201d a plan he said was put on hold because of China\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate. This week, Mnuchin said TikTok U.S. is \u201cworth a lot of money\u201d and stressed that \u201cif it\u2019s managed correctly and it can grow into other areas such as e-commerce and expand in the U.S., it\u2019s terrific business.\u201d",
      "Among those not in Trump\u2019s direct orbit, Donaldson, the YouTube superstar, has been the most public about his interest.",
      "Donaldson, who has more than 346 million YouTube subscribers, posted about wanting to buy TikTok earlier this month. The creator, 26, is one of the internet\u2019s most recognizable faces, having grown a multimillion-dollar company, which employs hundreds of people in North Carolina and pumps out videos featuring competitions and stunts that regularly attract tens of millions of views.",
      "\u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll buy Tik Tok so it doesn\u2019t get banned,\u201d he wrote in one X post, later adding: \u201cUnironically I\u2019ve had so many billionaires reach out to me since I tweeted this, let\u2019s see if we can pull this off.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's spokesperson Matthew Hiltzik confirmed that the creator would be interested in buying TikTok as part of a group, and is holding discussions with prospective buyers but has not exclusively joined any bids.",
      "Another person who has entertained the idea of potentially buying TikTok is Canadian entrepreneur Kevin O\u2019Leary, a longtime \u201cshark,\u201d or investor, on the business reality TV series \u201cShark Tank.\u201d He\u2019s part of \u201cThe People\u2019s Bid\" consortium.",
      "In a Fox News appearance Friday, just after the Supreme Court upheld the law banning TikTok, O\u2019Leary said he offered up $20 billion to buy TikTok, saying that selling TikTok is \u201cthe obvious solution\u201d for ByteDance.",
      "A representative for O\u2019Leary did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Also joining the fray last week was artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI, which has put in a bid to ByteDance to merge with TikTok."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:56:17 GMT",
    "summary": "In interviews with a dozen Jan. 6 offenders who received pardons from Trump, they were largely grateful for his deliverance, but signs of remorse were in short supply, though a few others have expressed contrition.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Gina Bisignano\u2019s strategy paid off. For years, the Jan. 6 defendant had done anything and everything she could to delay her criminal case in connection with her actions during the Capitol attack, hoping and praying that Donald Trump would be re-elected and pardon her.",
      "On Monday, just two days before her 56th birthday, Bisignano had another reason to celebrate, when Trump issued pardons that erased the case against her. A federal judge signed the dismissal on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Bisignano was a free woman.",
      "\u201cI have no regrets,\u201d Bisignano said, adding that she wouldn\u2019t change anything even if \u201cyou handed me a million dollars.\u201d",
      "It was a common thread among a dozen interviews NBC News conducted with Jan. 6 offenders who received pardons from Trump this week. They were uniformly grateful for Trump\u2019s deliverance, but unlike in many of the sentencing hearings held at Washington\u2019s federal courthouse in recent years, signs of remorse were in short supply, though a few others have expressed contrition. Many still hold onto the false, debunked notion \u2014 stoked by Trump as recently as Monday, while standing in the Capitol \u2014 that the 2020 election was stolen. And while some of those pardoned spoke words of conciliation, others hinted eagerly at a reckoning to come.",
      "Bisignano told NBC News she believes that God placed her in the lower west tunnel of the Capitol, where some of the worst violence took place on Jan. 6, 2021, and where she picked up a megaphone and encouraged a mob of her fellow Trump supporters to join the battle.",
      "She initially cooperated with law enforcement, testifying against a fellow Trump supporter she knew from California. But her testimony wasn\u2019t very useful, with U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson calling Bisignano \u201ca hot mess\u201d and \u201cpossibly one of the worst witnesses\u201d she\u2019d ever heard. Now, Bisignano said, she has \u201cprevailed\u201d and come out \u201cmuch stronger\u201d on the other side of the experience.",
      "\u201cThe hunters have become the hunted,\u201d she said, predicting that the federal prosecutors who pursued her case would be fired and calling for Jackson to be removed as well. \u201cShe needs to be impeached,\u201d Bisignano said. \u201cShe\u2019s on the wrong side of history, Ms. Amy Jackson. I\u2019d like to have a little conversation with her.\u201d",
      "Bisignano wasn\u2019t the only one celebrating. Outside the D.C. jail, supporters quickly bought up MAGA hats from a vendor to hand out to prisoners upon their release. One of those gathered was Eric Ball, whose son Daniel was in jail facing charges of setting off an explosive device in the lower west Capitol tunnel during the riot. Eric Ball said the riot was a setup: \u201cAnybody who denies it is either incredibly evil, or irredeemably stupid,\u201d he said.",
      "(Daniel Ball is one of only a handful of Jan. 6 rioters still in custody: He was rearrested on gun charges, related to past convictions for domestic violence by strangulation and battery against a law enforcement officer, following his release in Washington.)",
      "Gregory Purdy, who was convicted of six felonies, including assaulting law enforcement officers, was among those still holding onto the false claims that the 2020 election was rigged.",
      "\u201cEven if we have a difference of opinion, I believe the people there were defending democracy,\u201d Purdy said upon his release from the D.C. jail on Tuesday. \u201cI believe that we had an election that had major computational issues.\u201d",
      "Caleb Fuller, the younger half of a father-son pair facing felony civil disorder charges of resisting police on Jan. 6, said after his case was dismissed that he still believes the 2020 election was stolen and that he saw no violence during the Capitol riot.",
      "Ryan Wilson, who was found guilty of six felonies after prosecutors presented evidence of him using a pipe as a weapon against police in a Capitol tunnel, also called the charges he faced \u201cphony\u201d upon his release from the D.C. jail.",
      "Rachel Powell was sentenced to five years in prison (and served just over a year) for actions on Jan. 6, 2021, that included using an ice axe to destroy a window at the Capitol. Asked what she would change if she could go back in time after receiving her pardon, Powell said, \u201cYou know what, when the police became violent and everything started getting out of control, I wish we would\u2019ve all just sat down.\u201d",
      "Another pardon recipient, Gabriel Garcia, was reminded of a previous interview where he said \"I regret going that day,\" distanced himself from the Proud Boys, and said that he wished he'd never gone to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But as he was anticipating his pardon Monday, Garcia said he \"never cut off\" from the Proud Boys. And as for his previous words of regret: \"No, I didn't mean it.",
      "Others\u2019 thoughts quickly turned more ominous.",
      "William Sarsfield, who was convicted of committing violence in the Capitol, headed to Washington to await the release of friends after he got out of the federal detention center in Philadelphia.",
      "He thanked Trump profusely for pardoning him and issued a vague threat when asked what he would do next: \u201cTo regroup, go home and find out the nefarious actors in local homes and towns, because we\u2019ve got to take care of our own house. and it starts there,\u201d Sarsfield said, wearing a camouflage hat emblazoned with the words \u201cBiden sucks.\u201d",
      "Another prominent Jan. 6 offender, Jacob Chansley, posted on X that he was going to buy guns after receiving his pardon and having gun rights restored. \u201cEVERYTHING done in the dark WILL come to light!\u201d he continued.",
      "But Purdy and some others did sound notes of reconciliation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still brothers and sisters, we\u2019ve still got to love each other. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to make sure that you don\u2019t have hate in your heart for anybody,\u201d Purdy told NBC News. \u201cSo to my liberal brothers and sisters, I reach my arm across and say, let\u2019s find common ground.\u201d",
      "Guy Reffitt, who was turned in by his son over his role on Jan. 6, said he loved his son in an interview shortly after he was released. His son, Jackson, told MSNBC earlier on Wednesday that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine being safe now\u201d that his father had been released and that he had bought a gun for protection.",
      "Mostly, the pardon recipients were effusive in their praise of Trump, whose false statements about the 2020 election being stolen helped set off the chain of events that led many of them to the Capitol when the Electoral College results were set to be certified.",
      "\u201cThank you, cause he\u2019s put my family back together again. Without him, I wouldn\u2019t be out right now,\u201d Powell said of Trump.",
      "One inmate in the D.C. jail, speaking by phone to a small crowd gathered outside on Monday, said he and others had been watching as Trump mentioned pardoning Jan. 6 offenders in remarks shortly after his inaugural address.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages,\u201d Trump had said to an overflow crowd of supporters in the Capitol\u2019s Emancipation Hall, after suggestng that advisers had asked him to leave that out of his inaugural address to make the speech more \u201cunifying.\u201d",
      "Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the Oath Keepers militia who was found guilty by a federal jury of charges that included seditious conspiracy, had his 18-year sentence commuted by Trump. Rhodes\u2019 first stop after his release was outside the D.C. jail, where he commended the president for doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d and said he and others had not received a \u201cfair trial\u201d in front of a \u201cfair jury.\u201d (Multiple Jan. 6 convictions have been upheld by a federal appeals court that considered and dismissed claims of jury bias.)",
      "On Wednesday, reporters spotted Rhodes in one of the House of Representatives\u2019 office buildings in the Capitol complex. He said he was there to advocate for the release of a fellow Oath Keeper, Jeremy Brown, who is still in prison because he was convicted of other federal charges unrelated to Jan. 6.",
      "\u201cHe needs a pardon also,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cNo man left behind.\u201d"

At the end of the event the suspect was found to be deceased, we don't know if he was shot by a self-inflicted wound or whether or not he was shot by squad officers.\"",

      "\u201cIt is my hope that today\u2019s verdict brings resolution to Carma\u2019s family and others who have waited years for answers and accountability after losing their loved ones,\u201d prosecutor Ryan Mears said in a statement.",

      "\u201cThere were a lot of blue napkins that were in there that were blood-soaked. There was clothing in there that was blood-soaked. I saw a pair of women\u2019s Crocs shoes and what appeared to me to be women\u2019s clothing, all blood-soaked,\u201d he said, according to the station.",
      "Sentencing in Purpura\u2019s killing is scheduled for Feb. 13, court records show.",
      "In the Tennessee cases, Mendenhall was sentenced to serve the two life terms consecutively, or one after the other."

    "summary": "The trial of three men who prosecutors say facilitated a drugging and robbery scheme that terrorized New York City\u2019s gay bars and led to two deaths began Wednesday in a downtown Manhattan courtroom.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of three men who prosecutors say facilitated a drugging and robbery scheme that terrorized New York City\u2019s gay bars and led to two deaths began Wednesday in a downtown Manhattan courtroom.",
      "Jayqwan Hamilton, 36; Robert Demaio, 35; and Jacob Barroso, 30, are accused of working together to drug and rob five men after meeting them outside Manhattan gay bars and nightclubs from March 2021 to June 2022. Prosecutors alleged that the crimes led to the deaths of social worker Julio Ramirez, 25, and political consultant John Umberger, 33, in the spring of 2022. The crimes didn\u2019t come into broad public view until May 2022 \u2014 more than a year after the scheme began \u2014 when NBC News reported on Ramirez\u2019s mysterious death.",
      "Hamilton, Demaio and Barroso pleaded not guilty to charges in connection with the scheme that included murder, conspiracy and grand larceny. Attorneys for Hamilton and Demaio declined to comment. An attorney for Barroso did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In her opening statement, Assistant District Attorney Emily Ching said the three men \u2014 along with three others who had previously pleaded guilty to lesser charges \u2014 lurked outside several Manhattan gay bars, befriended seemingly intoxicated men and then suggested the victims continue the night with them at subsequent locations.",
      "Once in private, Ching said, the defendants worked together to drug the victims to the point of incapacitation using a concoction that included fentanyl. Next, she said, the defendants would use the victims\u2019 unconscious faces to access their bank accounts and payment apps using facial recognition technology. They would then steal thousands of dollars and use the victims\u2019 payment apps to pay for food, shoes, alcohol and other items, according to Ching.",
      "The assistant district attorney also laid out how the same methods were allegedly used to target and rob Ramirez and Umberger, which ultimately led to their deaths.",
      "\u201cThe evidence will make it very clear that it does not matter who handed the drugs to the victims,\u201d Ching said. \u201cThe evidence will establish that each defendant intended to commit the robberies, succeeded together in committing the robberies and, as a result, the victims died.\u201d",
      "In their opening statements, attorneys for the three defendants called the deaths \u201ctragic\u201d but asked jurors to keep an open mind until the end of the case.",
      "\u201cWe ask you to put that aside and decide this case on the evidence,\u201d Dean J. Vigliano, an attorney for Demaio, pleaded.",
      "The attorneys also said that it was impossible to know which drugs led to the deaths of\u00a0 Ramirez and Umberger. Ching acknowledged that some of the victims, including Ramirez and Umberger, used illicit drugs recreationally on occasion.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t prove which drugs killed these two individuals,\u201d Vigliano said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find if you look at the toxicology reports, any number of these drugs could have killed these individuals.\u201d",
      "The New York City medical examiner\u2019s office ruled the deaths of Ramirez and Umberger as homicides caused by a \u201cdrug-facilitated theft.\u201d The drugs found in their systems included fentanyl, lidocaine and cocaine, according to the medical examiner\u2019s report",
      "One of the surviving victims who testified Wednesday, referred to solely by his first name, Alex, admitted to using recreational drugs on occasion, such as marijuana and cocaine. He said, however, he did not do so to the point of incapacitation.",
      "Ching said video footage from the night of Alex\u2019s encounter shows him losing mobility shortly after meeting up with two of the defendants outside his hotel in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square. She said the two men then wheeled Alex\u2019s unconscious body into his hotel room using a luggage cart, where they then robbed him.",
      "Other surviving victims and the mother of Umberger, Linda Clary, are expected to testify."

    "story": [
      "New Orleanians and tourists Tuesday marked the city\u2019s highest snowfall in decades by skiing down Bourbon Street, trekking to neighborhood restaurants that remained open and having a snowball fight in the French Quarter.",
      "The snow brought some levity to a city jolted on New Year\u2019s Day by a terrorist attack that killed 14 people and injured dozens more when a driver in a pickup truck barreled into crowds on Bourbon Street.",
      "But the winter storm, which dumped up to 10 inches of snow on some areas of New Orleans, also meant added work for city and state workers.",
      "Local interstate highways, along with the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway bridge were closed because of snow and ice. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry posted on X urging people to stay off the roads to make way for emergency personnel. \u201cI hope everyone is safe and warm at home with a big pot of gumbo,\u201d he said.",
      "Collin Arnold, New Orleans\u2019 director of homeland security and emergency preparedness, said in a press briefing Tuesday afternoon that the city had brought in 14 snow plows with a priority of clearing roadways near local hospitals.",
      "\u201cThe next couple of days, there's going to be a lot of recovery from this just as far as roadways,\u201d he said.",
      "Although no snow is forecast for the remainder of this week, temperatures are expected to remain below freezing into Thursday. And public schools in the city remained closed Wednesday and expected to be closed Thursday.",
      "Meanwhile, there\u2019s more work ahead with the Super Bowl less than three weeks away, expected to bring upward of 125,000 revelers to the area.",
      "Michael Hecht, state infrastructure coordinator for the Super Bowl, said some contractors tried to get ahead of Tuesday\u2019s storm this past weekend. As the city braced for temperatures to drop, crews worked on paving and light installation projects in the French Quarter.",
      "He said the planners\u2019 goals were to conclude as many projects as possible by Jan. 31, because some visitors will begin arriving as early as Feb. 1. The city\u2019s timeline accounted for weather delays, he said, but work would need to resume by Thursday to remain on track to complete the bulk of the remaining projects.",
      "\u201cSaying that we\u2019re going to be able to land the plane doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t appreciate a slightly longer runway,\u201d Hecht said.",
      "Jay Cicero, president of the Super Bowl Host Committee, said in a statement that he was \u201cconfident the teams on the ground will complete these preparations on time and within their original scope.\u201d",
      "In recent years, winter storms have brought hardships to major Southern cities. During a 2021 crisis in Texas, more than 200 people died after millions of energy customers lost power. Freezing temperatures that year also left many residents and businesses in Jackson, Mississippi, and Shreveport, Louisiana, without running water.",
      "So far, New Orleans has had only a smattering of power outages and no major issues with its water supply. But some leaders have expressed concerns about how some of the most vulnerable New Orleanians are faring.",
      "Last week, under an emergency order from Landry, the state shut down an encampment of homeless people near the Superdome. Several were bused to a temporary shelter, a warehouse located several miles away.",
      "Landry has described it as an effort to protect the city\u2019s homeless people, as well as the city. \u201cIt is in the best interest of every citizen\u2019s safety and security to give the unhoused humane and safe shelter as we begin to welcome the world to the City of New Orleans for both Super Bowl LIX and Mardi Gras,\u201d he said in a statement on Jan 13. But some New Orleans officials and advocates said the use of a temporary warehouse facility harmed their efforts to provide long-term housing.",
      "Slim Goodies Diner, in the city\u2019s Uptown district, was one of the few local restaurants that remained open Tuesday.",
      "The eatery, which was among the first to open in the city after Hurricane Katrina, has a reputation for toughing out storms ahead of evacuation orders and welcoming patrons back early when they subside.",
      "\u201cWe are known for always being open, no matter what it is that happens,\u201d owner Deborah Schumacher said.",
      "For Hecht, the snow is just one more thing the city will survive and meet with good humor.",
      "\u201cWe somewhat have gotten tired of the word resilient in this city, because it\u2019s overused and sometimes seems to be an excuse for a lack of preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this case, we\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:35:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China and overcharging U.S. ships.",
    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to the country where it is located, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the closest U.S. allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d the critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of global maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a Spanish-language statement.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America Program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began construction on the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way down to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and non-discriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.",
      "In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though located at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.",
      "\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease due to a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of which country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations against Panama could hurt U.S. relations with one of its closest allies in Latin America, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died due to injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride given the 1989 U.S. invasion during which hundreds of Panamanians were killed.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

    "summary": "More than 2,400 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas took effect.",
    "story": [
      "More than 2,400 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip since the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas took effect, according to United Nations officials, as attention shifted to rebuilding the enclave devastated during 15 months of intensive Israeli bombardment.",
      "During the conflict, aid flows to the blockaded enclave were severely restricted.",
      "As the truce entered its fourth day Wednesday, video from Reuters showed convoys of trucks carrying humanitarian aid rolling into Rafah, in Gaza's south. In one, Palestinians were seen running after the trucks along the city's battered roads as they scrambled to pick up purple plastic aid bags that had fallen off. In another, they were seen picking up plastic water bottles from the ground, flanked by the ruins of damaged buildings.",
      "The U.N. previously estimated that around 60% of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed, including schools and hospitals. Aid and fuel deliveries were severely restricted during the conflict, prompting international criticism of Israel.",
      "More than 47,000 people have been killed in Israeli bombing during the conflict, according to local health officials. Meanwhile, around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population \u2014 almost 1.9 million people \u2014 have been displaced from their homes and forced to live in tent camps and other makeshift shelters, according to the United Nations.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Israeli officials must allow at least 600 truckloads of aid, including 50 carrying fuel, to enter Gaza daily during the initial six weeks. Half of those trucks will be directed to Gaza\u2019s north, where experts had warned famine was imminent.",
      "A senior U.N. official told Reuters on Wednesday that so far, there had been no apparent law-and-order issues in ensuring the flow of aid into the besieged area. Looters and criminal gangs have raided aid trucks during the conflict, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that killed 1,200 and saw some 250 taken hostage.",
      "The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the aid would extend to providing food assistance and health care, including opening bakeries, restocking hospitals, repairing water networks and shelters, and reuniting families.",
      "In the al-Dahra area in central Khan Younis, NBC News captured video of uniformed officers from al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing, stationed along the streets to supervise trucks and ensure the safe delivery of aid into the city Monday.",
      "Abdul Wahab Abdul Raouf Samour, 40, a police officer, was deployed to patrol the streets and facilitate the traffic along the enclave.",
      "\"We were informed by the Interior Ministry to wear military uniforms and military suits and head directly to work,\" he told NBC News' team Monday, adding that Palestinian officials had instructed those deployed to ensure security measures were in place to prevent looting.",
      "\"As you see, we are facilitating the traffic movement for the cities, and, God willing, we hope to serve our people more than this,\" he added.",
      "Across the enclave, video captured by NBC News showed scenes of ash-covered buildings and streets lined with the shattered debris from homes and shops. Other drone footage captured Gaza before and after the 15 months of the war, showing how its cities had been decimated.",
      "But even the promise of a ceasefire could not protect some Palestinians in Gaza looking to rebuild their lives as Israeli airstrikes continued in Khan Younis on Monday.",
      "When Ahmed Qudra, 35, stepped out of his home to buy his seven children chicken wings from the market, he was killed by Israeli missiles that struck a vehicle carrying security forces and killed four security officers. The attack also took the lives of three of Qudra\u2019s children while injuring two others.",
      "\u201cWe went to bed believing the ceasefire started at 8:30. How could we have known that things had changed? How could we have known our happiness would turn into devastation?\u201d  Hanan, Qudra\u2019s wife, told NBC News' ground crew through tears.",
      "\u201cOn Friday, we asked him to bring us chicken wings. He said he would. Now he\u2019s gone,\u201d said 12-year-old son Adel, who saw his father and siblings killed."

Another 23,000 people were under evacuation warnings.

The area is under \u201cred flag\u201d warnings through Friday morning, with wind gusts of up to 65 mph possible in the mountains, the National Weather Service said.

    "summary": "Experts dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China and overcharging U.S. ships.",
    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to the country where it is located, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the closest U.S. allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d the critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of global maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a Spanish-language statement.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America Program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began construction on the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way down to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and non-discriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.",
      "In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though located at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.",
      "\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease due to a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of which country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations against Panama could hurt U.S. relations with one of its closest allies in Latin America, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died due to injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride given the 1989 U.S. invasion during which hundreds of Panamanians were killed.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

      "The complaint stated that Baldoni allegedly improvised physical intimacy that had not been previously rehearsed or discussed, including improvising kisses during one scene.",
      "The complaint also alleged Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath pressured Lively to \u201csimulate full nudity\u201d during a scene in which her character is giving birth.",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

As the two resolved their issues in the following episodes and eventually tied the knot in the season finale, Francis\u2019 paternity controversy unfolded on social media, with the mother of his children sharing her side of the story.",
      "During the reunion, which aired Oct. 30, 2024, Adionser and Francis said they were still happily together and enjoying married life despite the obstacle. But on Monday, Jan. 21, Adionser confirmed in a statement to TODAY.com that she and Francis recently split.",
      "\u201cAfter much reflection, I want to share that Tyler and I have been separated for several weeks and have now made the difficult decision to end our marriage,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWhile I had hoped for mutual understanding and transparency in our relationship, it has become clear that our paths are no longer aligned, making it impossible for me to continue in this marriage.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cThis was not a decision I made lightly, but one I know is necessary for my own growth and peace. While this chapter is ending, I will always hold respect for the time and love we shared. I kindly ask for privacy during this deeply personal time as I focus on healing and building a new future. Thank you for your understanding and support.\u201d",
      "On the show, Adionser and Francis had an emotional conversation after it was revealed that he had fathered three children. In Episode 10, Francis explained to Adionser, \u201cI had a very close friend. Her and her wife wanted to have a baby. And they couldn\u2019t afford a sperm donor. I thought that was God telling me, you know, \u2018Help someone else.\u2019 And it felt good.\u201d",

      "Adionser chimed in and said that it was \u201cinsulting\u201d to her intelligence that fans suggested Francis \u201cblindsided\u201d her on the show with the news that he had three children.",
      "She explained that he did not want to speak about the situation on camera, but she felt differently. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like it would be an authentic experience, or that I could continue the experience if we didn\u2019t,\u201d Adionser said.",
      "\u201c(I said) \u2018I do\u2019 to all of it,\u201d she told hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey. \u201cI was aware and I took on what I wanted to.\u201d",
      "Before the season aired, the former couple spoke to TODAY.com in separate interviews and gushed about their love story.",
      "\u201cIt was just a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt before in my life. From day one, it was Ashley. It was a feeling that I\u2019ve constantly kept feeling with her. It was just safe. It was warm. It felt like the most love I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d Francis said.",
      "Adionser acknowledged that she was skeptical during the process but felt that Francis was the right person for her.",

Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",

      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",
      "Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.",

    "title": "Trump says China controls the Panama Canal \u2014 but here\u2019s how it really works",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:35:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China and overcharging U.S. ships.",
    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to the country where it is located, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the closest U.S. allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d the critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of global maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a Spanish-language statement.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America Program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began construction on the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way down to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and non-discriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.",
      "In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though located at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.",
      "\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease due to a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of which country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations against Panama could hurt U.S. relations with one of its closest allies in Latin America, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died due to injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride given the 1989 U.S. invasion during which hundreds of Panamanians were killed.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

      "During the conflict, aid flows to the blockaded enclave were severely restricted.",
      "As the truce entered its fourth day Wednesday, video from Reuters showed convoys of trucks carrying humanitarian aid rolling into Rafah, in Gaza's south. In one, Palestinians were seen running after the trucks along the city's battered roads as they scrambled to pick up purple plastic aid bags that had fallen off. In another, they were seen picking up plastic water bottles from the ground, flanked by the ruins of damaged buildings.",

      "A senior U.N. official told Reuters on Wednesday that so far, there had been no apparent law-and-order issues in ensuring the flow of aid into the besieged area.

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hours after President Donald Trump rescinded American sanctions on far-right settler groups and individuals accused of involvement in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Israel\u2019s military said it had launched a \u201csignificant\u201d operation in the territory.",
      "Israeli forces moved into the northern city of Jenin in an offensive that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was launched to \u201cdefeat terrorism.\u201d Health authorities in the region said at least seven people were killed and dozens injured.",

      "Introduced by the Biden administration in February, Executive Order 14115 saw sanctions imposed on \u201cpersons undermining peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.\u201d",

      "It came after Trump described Gaza as a \u201cphenomenal location\u201d as he signed a series of executive orders in the Oval Office, shortly after his presidential inauguration ceremony.",
      "The decision to rescind the sanctions came a day after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect, bringing a pause to Israel's 15-month military offensive in Gaza. After phase one of the deal began Sunday, three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian teenagers and women who were imprisoned or detained by Israel.",
      "During his first term, Trump abandoned the long-held U.S. position that the settlements are illegal before it was restored by then-President Joe Biden.",

Ben-Gvir also took to X where he praised the \u201crighting of an injustice.\u201d",

      "Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people since then, according to health officials in the enclave, though researchers have estimated that the death toll could be significantly higher.",

      "In the year leading up to the Hamas attacks, 33 Israelis were killed in the West Bank, the database shows. Between that date and Jan. 6, the last date it was updated, it shows that 28 have been killed.",
      "Within hours of Monday's announcement from the White House, the  Israeli military said in a statement that dozens of \u201cIsraeli civilians,\u201d some of them masked, raided the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq. There, they \u201cinstigated riots, set property on fire and caused damage,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Troops were dispatched to the scene where they were attacked by Israelis, some of whom threw rocks, the statement added.",
      "A joint investigation into the incident had been opened by the Department of Internal Police Investigations and the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division, the statement said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether any of those involved were arrested and charged, the IDF referred NBC News to the Israel Police. The police force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Palestinian health officials said in a statement that at least seven people were killed and around 35 injured as a result of the operation.",
      "Referring to the region as Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the West Bank, Smotrich said in a separate statement that the operation would help to \u201cchange the security perception\u201d about the region.",

      "When asked Tuesday about Trump\u2019s comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that \u201cwe respect the choice of the American people\u201d and that \u201cTrump has also repeatedly given reason to say that they also respect the choice of the Russian people.\u201d",
      "Middle East",
      "On the nascent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, something his team helped broker, the president said he was \u201cnot confident\u201d that the truce would last, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not our war. It\u2019s their war.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials credit Trump's Middle East peace envoy, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0with helping get that deal over the line.",
      "On Gaza \u2014 where Israeli airstrikes have displaced most of the population and killed more than 46,000 people, according to local authorities \u2014 he hinted at his real estate background.",
      "\u201cGaza is like a massive demolition site. That place has really got to be rebuilt in a different way,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s a phenomenal location on the sea, best weather. ... Some beautiful things could be done with it.\u201d",
      "Trump also rescinded Biden\u2019s sanctions on Israel settlers in the occupied West Bank, who have been accused of violence against Palestinians.",
      "The president\u2019s first term was characterized by a succession of pro-Israel moves, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and ditching the Iran nuclear deal. The 2020 Abraham Accords, establishing relations between Israel and several Middle Eastern and North African countries, was perhaps the first Trump administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement.",
      "North Korea",
      "In South Korea, there was palpable nervousness after Trump referred to North Korea as a \u201cnuclear power.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have long refrained from using the phrase as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea \u201ccan never be recognized\u201d as such.",
      "Among the norm-busting sagas of the president's first term was his nuclear brinkmanship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The two traded personal insults and nuclear threats, before Trump told  the world that \"we fell in love.\"",
      "China",
      "While campaigning in 2024, Trump suggested he could slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, risking a rerun of the Beijing trade war he fought during his first term.",
      "Now he suggests these tariffs could be used to force through a deal in which the U.S. acquires half of the social media platform TikTok. An executive order Trump signed Monday postponed for 75 days a Biden law that requires the Chinese tech giant ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or see the platform banned in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok,\u201d Trump told reporters. Asked about ByteDance\u2019s close ties with the Chinese government, he said he \u201ccould see a deal\u201d in which the U.S. \u201cpolices it a little \u2014 maybe a lot.\u201d",
      "Trump also reiterated his comments about the Panama Canal and \u201ctaking it back,\u201d claiming the key waterway was being controlled by China.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news briefing Tuesday that Beijing was \u201cwilling to work with the new U.S. administration, adhering to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence\u201d \u2014 perhaps hinting at past clashes.",
      "Europe's far right",
      "While U.S. inaugurations have historically been largely domestic affairs, figures on the global political right \u2014 including some on its extreme hard-right populist fringes \u2014 were invited to Washington on Monday.",
      "Among them were lawmakers from Alternative for Germany, a far-right nationalist party under surveillance by Berlin for suspected extremism that Trump ally Elon Musk has recently championed.",
      "Italy\u2019s staunch anti-immigration Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also attended.",
      "Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, a longtime Trump ally, said Trump's inauguration would aid the far-right's political assault on the European Union's mainstream.",
      "\u201cSo the great attack can start,\" he said at an event in Budapest. \"Hereby I launch the second phase of the offensive that aims to occupy Brussels.\u201d",
      "He is an arch antagonist of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who offered her own assessment.",
      "\u201cWe have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition,\u201d she said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cBreaking the bonds in the global economy is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump alarmed European leaders by suggesting he might not defend them against Russia unless they paid more toward defense. He reiterated his latest demand Monday for those countries to contribute 5% of their gross domestic products toward defense, more than double NATO's recommendation.",
      "He has also unnerved Denmark by suggesting he might take its autonomous territory of Greenland by force.",
      "Climate change",
      "As expected, one of Trump\u2019s first executive orders was to leave the 2016 Paris climate change accord, in which countries agreed to limit post-industrial temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "This will put the United States alongside Yemen, Iran and Libya as nonsignatories to the deal, which Trump said was a \u201crip-off\u201d but experts say is still humanity\u2019s best hope at limiting catastrophe.",
      "Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced a ban \u2014 which would require an act of Congress to reverse \u2014 on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline.",
      "Even so, the Paris agreement does not \"reflect our country\u2019s values,\u201d the White House said, with Trump instead promising to \"drill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The WHO",
      "It was likewise anticipated that Trump would junk Washington\u2019s role in the World Health Organization. He has alleged that the global health body aided Chinese government efforts to \u201cmislead the world\u201d over Covid \u2014 something both the WHO and Beijing deny.",
      "The U.S. is by far the WHO\u2019s biggest financial backer, providing 18% of its $6.8 billion budget. Signing an executive order to leave the WHO, Trump said that China\u2019s lower contribution but higher population \u201cseems a little unfair to me.\u201d",
      "Experts say that leaving the organization could undermine worldwide programs to tackle diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."

    "story": [
      "He was Donald Trump\u2019s man in the room as the ceasefire and hostage release deal was forged between Israel and Hamas, but Steve Witkoff is no diplomat despite his appointment as the president-elect\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements. Witkoff, 67, was raised in Long Island and trained as a real estate lawyer before charting a path in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate development.",
      "He has known Trump for decades, is a Republican donor and served on one of Trump\u2019s Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. He\u2019s also going to be one of the speakers at Trump\u2019s pre-inauguration rally Sunday, alongside Hulk Hogan, Megyn Kelly, Elon Musk and others.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani made a clear reference to Witkoff, who is Jewish and has done business throughout the Middle East, during a Wednesday press conference confirming that a Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal had been reached.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. to reach to that deal,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, a key mediator in the talks, told the crowd of reporters and dignitaries, which included Witkoff himself. \u201cAnd I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us in the last couple of days, and they played a vital role in reaching to this moment.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",
      "\u201cI have to say, Brett McGurk has been very fortunate to have been joined in these last 96 hours by Steve Witkoff\u201d in what \u201chas really been a historic and crucial partnership between the two of them to help nail down some of the final arrangements,\u201d the official said.",
      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",
      "A Middle Eastern diplomat who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity said Witkoff, as well as being a tough negotiator, talked about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 at age 22, telling \u201cofficials he empathizes with parents who have lost children on both sides.\u201d",
      "Neither Witkoff nor his office responded to requests for comment on this story."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea\u00a0\u2014\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u2019s anti-corruption officials on Thursday requested that prosecutors indict impeached President Yoon\u00a0Suk Yeol for insurrection and abuse of power over his short-lived martial law declaration.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO) named\u00a0Yoon, the first sitting president to be arrested in\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u2019s history, as the ringleader of an insurrection, also involving his defense minister at the time.",
      "The dramatic events of recent weeks have plunged\u00a0South\u00a0Korea\u00a0into a political crisis that has\u00a0dragged on the economy\u00a0and raised concerns among allies, including the U.S., about the country\u2019s political stability.",
      "Yoon, impeached and suspended from power on Dec. 14, has been\u00a0incarcerated\u00a0since last week pending an investigation into his Dec. 3 attempt to impose martial law \u2014 a move that shocked the nation even though it was overturned within hours by parliament.",
      "The CIO was established in 2021 as an independent anti-graft agency to investigate high-ranking officials including the president and their family members and has led a joint\u00a0team\u00a0involving police and the defense ministry, while prosecutors carry out their own inquiry.",
      "Under the law, the CIO can only investigate\u00a0the president, not\u00a0prosecute, and must refer any case to the prosecutors\u2019 office for further action.",
      "The CIO has said\u00a0Yoon\u2019s detention is due to end around Jan. 28, but they expect prosecutors to ask the court to extend it for another 10 days before they formally charge the president.",
      "The Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutors have already charged\u00a0Yoon\u2019s defense minister at the time, Kim Yong-hyun, with insurrection. Chiefs of the Capital Defense Command, the Defense Counterintelligence Command, and the Seoul police and the national police commissioner are also among the officials indicted so far.",
      "Since his arrest on Jan.\u00a015,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0has refused to speak to CIO investigators and defied their summons.",
      "Lee Jae-seung, deputy chief of the CIO, said it would be more \u201cefficient\u201d for the prosecutors to take over the investigation before indicting\u00a0Yoon, citing the president\u2019s refusal to cooperate.",
      "\u201cDespite the fact that the suspect is under serious allegations that he was ringleader of an insurrection, he continues to be uncooperative to this day, not responding to the criminal justice proceedings and refusing our questioning itself,\u201d Lee told a briefing.",
      "He said investigators had obtained testimonies from several military officials on\u00a0Yoon\u00a0allegedly trying to arrest politicians and mentioning a second martial law order.\u00a0Yoon\u00a0and his lawyers denied these allegations.",
      "Yoon, a top prosecutor before becoming president, now finds his criminal case in the hands of prosecutors from that same world, though how close their current ties are is unclear.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly said the CIO has no authority to handle his case as the law stipulates a wide-ranging list of high-ranking officials and violations it can investigate, but has no mention of insurrection.",
      "A Seoul court ruled against\u00a0Yoon\u2019s lawyers when they tried to make that argument to prevent his arrest.",
      "Yoon\u2019s team also\u00a0said any criminal investigation should be conducted after the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove\u00a0Yoon\u00a0from office in its separate trial on his impeachment.",
      "The lawyers reiterated the position on Thursday to say they will hold the CIO accountable for what they called its illegal investigation, while asking prosecutors taking over the case to comply with the law.",
      "In comments on Tuesday to the Constitutional Court,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0denied ordering troops to drag lawmakers out of parliament or asking the finance minister to prepare a budget for an emergency legislative body.",
      "Insurrection, the crime that\u00a0Yoon\u00a0may be charged with, is one of the few that a\u00a0South\u00a0Korean president does not have immunity from and is technically punishable by death.\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, however, has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years.",
      "Yoon\u00a0attended another\u00a0Constitutional Court hearing in his impeachment trial on Thursday afternoon.",
      "His\u00a0lawyers repeated the president\u2019s earlier argument that he never intended to fully impose martial law, but had meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.",
      "In his first public appearance since attempting suicide in jail last month, former defense minister Kim appeared as a witness at Thursday\u2019s hearing and argued that the small number of troops mobilized proved that\u00a0Yoon\u00a0was not serious about imposing military control."

      "The State Department suspended its refugee program Tuesday night, halting all refugee flights into the United States, under direction of one of President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive orders.",
      "The order initially was set to go into effect on Monday, and its swift implementation surprised and alarmed advocates and nonprofits, leaving some refugees who were already in transit to the U.S. stranded in intermediate countries.",
      "\u201cTravel has been canceled for people who had plans,\" said Kathie O\u2019Callaghan, the president of Hearts and Homes for Refugees, a nonprofit based in Westchester County, N.Y., that resettles families from around the world.\u00a0\u201cMany of these families were very close to arriving and will be in limbo.\u201d",
      "There are hundreds of small groups like O'Callaghan's as well as larger organizations such as churches and international nonprofits that work with the federal government to resettle refugees around the country.",
      "Advocates say data shows refugees are not an excessive drain on government resources and tend to go on to be successfully employed after receiving initial public assistance upon arrival. The rate of employment and participation in the labor force for refugees exceeds that of the U.S. population as a whole, according to\u00a0studies.",
      "Refugees are also subject to more elaborate security vetting than immigrants to the U.S., experts say.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a longtime advocate for refugees, said she was \u201calarmed\u201d by the executive order to suspend the program.",
      "\"Stepping away from this program at a time of unprecedented displacement will put refugees\u2019 lives at risk and ultimately weaken our nation\u2019s long-term security,\" Shaheen said in a statement Wednesday.",

      "The U.S. refugee resettlement program was largely decimated under the first Trump administration due to restructuring, budget cuts and the impact of the pandemic.",
      "The Biden administration began rebuilding it, and was still working on it up until Trump took office.

      "From October through December 2024, \"more than 27,000 refugees were admitted to the United States, 2,241 of whom were resettled by World Relief in collaboration with local church partners across the country,\" the organization said in a statement, noting that nearly 70% of those resettled refugees fled a threat of persecution in five countries: Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "The International Rescue Committee, a high-profile nonprofit refugee assistance group, called the decision \u201ca step backwards.\u201d",

      "Afghans at risk",
      "The suspension of the program leaves tens of thousands of Afghan refugees at risk, many of whom have already been vetted by the U.S., advocacy groups say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable to abandon them,\u201d said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of U.S. veterans and advocacy groups, noting that many of those remaining in Afghanistan are at great risk there.",

      "An Afghan woman resettled in the U.S. told NBC News that her parents were supposed to be on a Jan. 30 flight from Afghanistan to the United States, but she did not know whether the flight would go ahead. The family has not yet heard from the State Department about the planned flight.",
      "\u201cWe are so worried especially for my dad because he is hiding for three years. It is so hard for my family,\u201d said the woman, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used due to what she said are threats from the Taliban against her father, who served in the Afghan police and worked closely with the U.S. government before the Taliban came into power in 2021.",
      "In his first message to the U.S. diplomatic corps, Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent a State Department-wide memo setting priorities in line with the second Trump administration, including, \u201cCurbing Mass Migration and Securing Our Borders.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe era of mass migration must end. This Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage it,\u201d Rubio wrote in the note obtained by NBC News. \u201cAnd diplomacy with other nations, especially in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America\u2019s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants.\u201d",
      "But the administration\u2019s priorities on refugees may be at odds with some of its supporters. Earlier this month, before Monday\u2019s inauguration, several evangelical Christian organizations urged Trump to maintain the refugee program to ensure Christians facing persecution abroad can find safety in the United States.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful for President-elect Trump\u2019s commitment to ensuring that our nation\u2019s borders are strong and secure. We also appreciate and affirm his recent call to ensure systems so that immigrants \u2018with love for the country\u2019 are able \u2018to come in legally,\u2019\u201d the Christian groups said in a Jan. 14 statement.",
      "Trump has received strong support from evangelical voters, including in his election victory in November, and has promised to protect Christians from what he has portrayed as discrimination in American society.",
      "Out of the roughly 100,000 refugees admitted to the United States last year, nearly 30,000 were Christians from countries accused of persecuting the Christian community, according to the nonprofit Open Doors."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Harry and his legal team thrashed out a last-minute deal with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper group Wednesday to settle claims of widespread wrongdoing at the publisher. The prince received a \u201cfull apology\u201d but fell short of his mission to hold British tabloids accountable in open court.",
      "The Duke of Sussex\u2019s decision to settle his claims against News Group Newspapers (NGN) ends his efforts expose the misdeeds of the publisher of The Sun and long-shuttered News of the World in open trial.",
      "Along with former lawmaker Tom Watson, Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, had sued NGN over alleged unlawful activities carried out by journalists and private investigators working for the newspapers.",
      "The group, which had long denied the allegations, offered what it called a \u201cfull and unequivocal apology\u201d to Harry \u201cfor the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life.\u201d",
      "In the British civil court system, a settlement often involves the accused covering the claimant's legal fees, as well as handing over an additional cash payment.",
      "NGN said it was sorry for intruding into the private life of Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales and apologized to Harry \u201cfor the phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators instructed by them at the News of the World.\u201d",
      "Outside the London court where the trial had been due to take place, David Sherborne \u2014 the lawyer representing Harry and Watson \u2014 read out a statement on their behalf.",
      "\u201cAfter endless resistance, denials and legal battles by News Group Newspapers, including spending more than a billion pounds in payouts and in legal costs (as well as paying-off those in the know) to prevent the full picture from coming out, News UK [NGN\u2019s parent company] is finally held to account for its illegal actions and its blatant disregard for the law,\u201d Sherborne said.",
      "Sherborne\u2019s statement added that \u201cPrince Harry and his immediate family have also had to repeatedly withstand aggressive and vengeful coverage since starting his claim over five years ago,\u201d which   he said had left them concerned for their safety.",
      "\u201cToday the lies are laid bare. Today, the cover-ups are exposed. And today proves that no one stands above the law,\u201d he said.",
      "Harry first brought the lawsuit against NGN in 2019 and the eight-week trial was supposed to start Tuesday. He had been expected to testify for several days next month.",
      "But in a surprising twist \u2014 one that angered Judge Timothy Fancourt \u2014 both sides on Tuesday asked for more time to thrash out a deal.\u00a0When Fancourt refused to allow a further delay until Wednesday, attorneys on both sides said they would go to the Court of Appeal to challenge his ruling, stalling the start of the trial.",
      "Ahead of the trial, Sherborne alleged the newspapers had used deception to obtain his clients' medical, phone and flight records, as well as bugging homes and placing listening devices into cars.\u00a0He also alleged that executives destroyed documents and used other methods to conceal the chicanery.",
      "NGN also issued what it called a \u201cfull and unequivocal apology\u201d to Watson \u201cfor the unwarranted intrusion carried out into his private life during his time in Government by the News of the World during the period 2009-2011.\u201d",
      "When serving as a member of Parliament, Watson played a significant role in the initial inquiry into alleged phone-hacking by members of the British newspaper media. He also wrote a book charting the relationship between Murdoch-owned titles and politicians.",
      "NGN's apology said Watson had been \u201cplaced under surveillance in 2009 by journalists at the News of the World and those instructed by them.\u201d The former deputy leader of the Labour Party, it added, had also been awarded \u201csubstantial damages.\u201d",
      "Harry, meanwhile, began positioning himself at odds with the royal family\u2019s famous \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201d attitude on the matter two years ago. He became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court since Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, did so in the late 19th century.",
      "Harry revealed in court papers that his father opposed his litigation, but although other claimants including celebrities, sports stars and politicians settled cases with NGN, he had always said his mission was not to receive money but to get to the truth.",
      "NGN has already paid out hundreds of millions of pounds to victims of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by the News of the World but it has always denied there was wrongdoing at The Sun. It has also rejected allegations that senior figures knew about the activity or tried to cover it up.",
      "In a separate statement released as well as the apology, a spokesperson for NGN said the apology was \u201cfor incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun, not by journalists, during the period 1996-2011.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are strong controls and processes in place at all our titles today to ensure this cannot happen now.\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "The spokesperson also denied that Watson\u2019s phone was hacked. \u201cHad this gone to trial, NGN would have called evidence from telecoms experts to demonstrate that hacking after 2007 was nigh on impossible due to security upgrades undertaken by telecoms companies,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Even if he had gone to trial and won, Harry could still have been on the hook for a multimillion-pound legal bill. Under English civil law, a claimant who wins a court judgment that is lower than what they were offered to settle, has to pay the legal bills for both sides. The law is designed to discourage lengthy trials.",
      "Actor Hugh Grant had been a claimant with Harry, but said in April that he was forced to accept \u201can enormous amount of money\u201d to settle his case as he could have otherwise faced a large legal bill."

      "Ichiro Suzuki, the dominant contact hitter whose 19 years in the major leagues, most of them with the Seattle Mariners, were lined with records and accolades, on Tuesday became the first Asian player elected to baseball\u2019s Hall of Fame.",
      "He received 99.7% of the vote, missing a unanimous selection by one vote. New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, inducted in 2019, remains the only member of the Hall of Fame to get 100%.",
      "Ichiro joins starting pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner as part of the class of 2025 headed to Cooperstown, New York.",
      "Yoshimasa Hayashi, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, congratulated Ichiro on Wednesday, telling reporters in Tokyo that he was \u201ca superstar who has given hope and dreams to many people.\u201d",
      "Ichiro made his debut with the Mariners in 2001, becoming the first Japanese position player to join Major League Baseball. That season he won both the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards.",
      "He went on to be a 10-time All Star and earned 10 Gold Glove awards for exceptional defense, as well as three Silver Slugger awards for his elite batting. Ichiro earned a reputation as an exceptional leadoff hitter (with a .311 career batting average) and as a formidable right fielder who, even at 5-foot-9, was known to scale outfield walls to rob home runs.",
      "Ichiro racked up 3,089 hits in MLB after having already played nine years in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball league. Combining his hits from both leagues, he had 4,367 hits across his professional career, the most of any player in baseball history.",
      "Ichiro told NBC News in a 2022 interview that he endured his share of challenges after he arrived in Seattle and that he was intensely aware of how American fans would perceive him. While he said he didn\u2019t set out to \u201cperform for Asians,\u201d he knew his performance would be scrutinized if he didn\u2019t deliver.",
      "\u201cAs a player from Japan, as a guy that had led the league in hitting all seven years and then coming over being a first position player, I knew that I would be judged. And Japan baseball will be judged on how I did,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t able to produce, then they would judge Japan baseball as being at a lower level. And so that pressure was there, and that\u2019s what I had to carry.\u201d",

      "Ohio State defeats Notre Dame 34-23 to win national championship",
      "Early on, fans would heckle him with jeers like \u201cGo back to Japan,\u201d Ichiro recalled, describing the interactions as \u201cthe norm\u201d for him at the time. But he quickly chipped away at those who sought to doubt or dismiss him, hitting a home run in his first road game. In 2019, he retired with the Mariners, playing his final game at the Tokyo Dome against the Oakland Athletics.",
      "Ichiro was also voted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame this month, getting 323 out of 349 votes in his first year of eligibility. In 2022, he was the first Asian player to be inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame."
