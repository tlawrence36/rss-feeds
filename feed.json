      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

The 40-year-old actor and producer rose to fame playing April Ludgate on the television series \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and was nominated for an Emmy for her role on \u201cThe White Lotus.\u201d The couple married in 2021.",
      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Bowl, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",
      "Kelce was already omnipresent on television and social media, so what was one more gig to add to his resume?",
      "So \u201cLate Night\u201d was born.",
      "Kelce is in the first year of a multiyear agreement with ESPN and already appears on the network\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show. The retired center taking center stage on a late-night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows. In September, it premiered entertainment news show \"The Takeaway,\u201d hosted by influencer Michelle Park. Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",
      "Wu, 50, rose to fame after moving to Hong Kong. Someone like Wu \u2014 who was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, became a Hong Kong cinema star and then pivoted to Hollywood \u2014 is a \u201crarity,\" Lo said. Before digital audiences, it was difficult to alternate between Asian and American screens, he continued.",
      "\u201cI think we were a breath of fresh air for those actors and talents and artists, when we said that we\u2019re going to be producing English content,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThere is an audience that\u2019s untapped here.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan said Wong Fu is not ruling out being \u201ca conduit\u201d for more crossover collaborations.",
      "Jocelyn Chan is still maintaining her singing career with hit singles and a solo Hong Kong concert this year. But she says the success of \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d has given her the courage to think about acting beyond Hong Kong. She\u2019s now looking for an agent in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

      "Indonesia\u2019s new government has begun an ambitious project to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",

      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",
      "",
      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",
      "",
      "State Rep. Christine Goodwin, a Republican from a southwestern Oregon district, called the proposal the \"latest example\" of urban legislators telling rural leaders what their communities need.",
      "",
      "The mobile health clinic pilot was eventually removed from the bill that was under discussion. That means no new abortion options in Oregon's Baker County  --  and no new state-funded maternity care either.",
      "",
      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",
      "",
      "Witham said that while she does not support abortion, she believes the government should not \"legislate it away completely.\" She said that unless the government provides far more support for young families, like free child care and better mental healthcare, abortion should remain legal.",

      "Conversations with a liberal school board member, a moderate owner of a timber company, members of Baker City's Republican Party chapter, a local doula, several pregnant women, and the director of the Baker County Health Department  --  many of whom were not rigidly opposed to abortion  --  all turned up the same answer: No mobile clinics offering abortions here, please.",
      "",
      "Kelle Osborn, RN, a nurse supervisor for the Baker County Health Department, loved the idea of a mobile clinic that would provide education and birth control services to people in outlying areas. She was less thrilled about including abortion services in a clinic on wheels.",
      "",
      "\"It's not something that should just be handed out from a mobile van,\" she said of abortion services. She said people in her conservative rural county would probably avoid using the clinics for anything if they were understood to provide abortion services.",

More than two-thirds of people in \"maternity care deserts\"  --  all of which are in rural counties  --  must drive more than a half-hour to get obstetric care, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. For people in the Southern states where lawmakers installed abortion bans, abortion care can be up to 700 miles away, according to a data analysis by Axios.",

      "Nathan Defrees, MD, grew up in Baker City and has practiced medicine here since 2017. He works for a family medicine clinic. If a patient asks about abortion, he provides information about where and how one can be obtained, but he doesn't offer abortions himself.",

      "He also pointed to the small number of patients requesting the service locally. Just six people living in Baker County had an abortion in 2023, according to data from the Oregon Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, 125 residents had a baby that year.",
      "",
      "A doctor with obstetric training living in another rural part of the state has chosen to quietly provide early-stage abortions when asked. The doctor, concerned for their family's safety in the small, conservative town where they live, asked not to be identified.",
      "",
      "The idea that better access to abortion is not needed in rural areas seems naive, the doctor said. People most in need of abortion often don't have access to any medical service not already available in town, the doctor pointed out. The first patient the doctor provided an abortion for at the clinic was a meth user with no resources to travel or to manage an at-home medication abortion.",
      "",
      "\"It seemed entirely inappropriate for me to turn her away for care I had the training and the tools to do,\" the doctor said.",

    "story": [
      "Flu is taking off in the U.S., with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week",
      "The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data.",
      "\u201cA lot of flu out there,\u201d said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Carrie Reed.",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs, Reed said. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added.",
      "Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but \u201cinfluenza has now joined the party,\u201d said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to roll,\u201d he added. \u201dOur hospitals are busy.\u201d",
      "One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor\u2019s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter\u2019s respiratory virus season \u2014 which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses.",
      "Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and western U.S. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England.",
      "So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths \u2014 including at least 11 children.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said.",
      "U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it\u2019s not too late to get a shot.",
      "You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.",
      "The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December.",
      "Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week.",
      "The cases are \u201cfairly sporadic\u201d and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.",

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

      "Hurricane Helene brought unprecedented and catastrophic flooding to western North Carolina, damaging a Baxter manufacturing site that was a major supplier of IV fluids. Hospitals across the country continue to grapple with the ensuing shortage of critical supplies.",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "A tunnel or bridge crossing the approximately 25-30 kilometers (15-18 miles) of volatile sea is so unlikely for the same reason that regularly vexes the country\u2019s planners \u2014 solutions for traversing New Zealand\u2019s remote, rugged and hazard-prone terrain are logistically fraught, analysts said.",
      "A Cook Strait tunnel would dramatically reduce the three- to four-hour sailing time between the North Island, home to 75% of the population, and the South.",
      "\u201cBut it would chew up, off the top of my head, about 20 years of the country\u2019s entire transport infrastructure development budget in one project,\u201d said Nicolas Reid, transport planner at MRCagney.",
      "He estimated a cost for a tunnel of 50 billion New Zealand dollars ($28 billion), comparable in today\u2019s terms to the price of the undersea tunnel that connects Britain and Europe by rail. New Zealand is the same size as the United Kingdom \u2014 but the U.K. has a population of 69 million, more than 13 times New Zealand\u2019s.",
      "It\u2019s also about the same size as Japan, which is home to the Seikan undersea rail tunnel connecting the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido \u2014 and has a population of 124 million.",
      "\u201cWe have a large infrastructure burden if we want to reach out across the country,\u201d said Reid. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve only got 5 million people to pay for it.\u201d",
      "New Zealand\u2019s volatile ground could also prove a problem. Perched on the boundary between tectonic plates, fault lines run under both the North and South Islands and earthquakes are sometimes centered in the strait, said seismologist John Risteau of GNS.",
      "Sailing on both Cook Strait ferry services \u2014 which have five ships transporting people, vehicles and freight \u2014 resumed Wednesday after two days of dangerous waves. Clearing the backlog meant more waiting and some passengers on one carrier said they could not book a new berth for a fortnight.",
      "The Cook Strait is less calm than many worldwide because it features opposing tides at each end \u2014 one where it joins the Tasman Sea and the other where it meets the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\u201cWe tend to have the prevailing, dominating wind funnel through Cook Strait, northerlies or southerlies, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re stronger there,\u201d said Gerard Bellam, a forecaster for the weather agency MetService. Swells in the strait this week reached 9 meters (30 feet), he said.",
      "Julia Rufey, an English tourist waiting at the Wellington terminal, said she had flown between North Island and South Island on previous trips, but \u201cadventure\u201d had prompted her to choose the ferry.",
      "\u201cWe thought, come to Wellington, try the ferry, which is already 3 1/2 hours late,\u201d she said.",
      "The ferries themselves, prone to breakdowns and more than half of them state-owned, have long been a political hot potato. The current government scrapped their predecessors\u2019 plan to replace the vessels before they become defunct in 2029 as too costly. The opposition has criticized the government for only partly revealing its new ferry replacement plan in December and for not divulging the cost.",
      "Still, some delayed on Wednesday said they would choose the ferry even if they had alternatives. Laurie Perino, an Australian tourist, said the pristine and scenic ocean views had prompted her to book.",
      "\u201cIt would be more convenient,\u201d she said, referring to a Cook Strait tunnel. \u201cBut I think a lot of people would still like to travel on the ferry.\u201d"

      "Authorities in Mexico are offering famed corridos singer Natanael Cano and other artists state protection after a drug cartel in northern Mexico publicly threatened them, prosecutors say",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico are offering state protection to famed regional Mexican singer Natanael Cano and other artists after a drug cartel in northern Mexico publicly threatened them, prosecutors confirmed to The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "Photos of a banner threatening the lives of Cano, a singer of corridos, a musical genre often linked to drug cartel violence, and several other artists in the Sonora region circulated on social media over the weekend.",
      "The banner appeared to be signed by \u201cJalisco Matasalas\u201d a group within a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the \u201cChapitos,\u201d which sowed terror in northern Mexico in recent months in a bloody power struggle. The gang accused the singers of \u201cfinancially helping\u201d a rival gang known as \u201cSalazares.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the last time you will receive a warning, just in time for you to cut the crap. Mind your own business,\u201d the banner read. \u201cIf you don't heed this warning, you will be shot.\u201d",
      "The Sonoran Prosecutor's Office on Tuesday told the AP that the threatening message was found hanging from a school and that they had opened an investigation.",
      "Allan de la Rosa, a spokesperson for the prosecutors, said authorities offered state protection to the artists to \u201cprevent any aggression related to the direct threat displayed on the banner.\" He did not elaborate on the nature of the protection.",
      "Cano's communications team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Corridos, made up of ballads from northern Mexico, is a musical genre that has long been linked to drug violence, but they also depict the harsh realities many Mexicans face living under narco violence. The genre, along with Mexican regional music, is experiencing a resurgence with younger artists like Cano and Peso Pluma blending classic styles with other genres like trap music.",
      "Over the past five years, streaming of Mexican music has grown 400% on Spotify and in 2023 Mexican artist Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Such artists have long faced sharp criticisms from authorities and threats from drug gangs.",
      "In 2023, Peso Pluma \u2014 who paid homage to drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n in songs \u2013 was forced to cancel a show in Tijuana after the 25-year-old received threats from a rival of the Sinaloa Cartel, warning that \u201cit would be your last performance\u201d if he proceeded with the concert.",
      "Later, Tijuana banned the performance of narco ballads altogether to protect \u201cthe eyes and ears\u201d of youths as it tries to contain violence. Local authorities in northern states previously banned musicians singing narcocorridos.",
      "The threat against Cano follows a surge in violence in Sinaloa and other northern Mexican states,",
      "The threats against Cano follow a surge of violence in Sinaloa and other northern Mexican states triggered by the kidnapping and capture of narco boss Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada and the ensuing all-out-war between rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, including the one that allegedly threatened Cano.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, who was traveling in the United States, said Rafael Tudares was kidnapped while on his way to drop off Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s two grandchildren at school in Caracas.",
      "In a post on X, Gonz\u00e1lez said \u201chooded men, dressed in black\u201d intercepted the vehicle and loaded Tudares \u201cinto a gold-colored van.\u201d He did not say what happened to his 6- and 7-year-old grandchildren.",
      "The kidnapping happened despite a significant increase in police and military presence since New Year\u2019s Day across Caracas ahead of Friday's swearing-in ceremony for Maduro, who the government says won a third term in the July election.",
      "The government\u2019s centralized press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a retired diplomat, represented Venezuela\u2019s Unitary Platform opposition coalition in the presidential election, which he and Maduro both claim to have won. The platform in a statement characterized Tudares' kidnapping as a \u201cforced disappearance for political reasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe demand the immediate release of Rafael Tudares and all political prisoners, who are hostages of a regime that knows it is rejected by the vast majority of Venezuelans who spoke with the force of the vote (on July 28),\u201d the coalition said in the statement.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez left Venezuela for exile in Spain in September after a judge issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with an election-related investigation. In recent weeks, he has vowed to return to his homeland to take the oath of office.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, is touring the Americas to try to rally support for his effort to get Maduro out of office by Friday. That's when, by law, the South American country\u2019s next presidential term begins. On Monday, Gonz\u00e1lez met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House as well as with U.S. Rep. Mike Waltz, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s designate to be his national security adviser once he is sworn in on Jan. 20.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, who has been recognized by several governments including the U.S. as Venezuela's president-elect, has not explained how he plans to return to the troubled country or wrest power from Maduro, whose ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela controls all aspects of government.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez had never run for office before July. The Unitary Platform coalition selected him in April as a last-minute stand-in for opposition powerhouse Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who was blocked by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice from running for any office.",
      "Machado last week urged supporters to demonstrate across Venezuela on Thursday, telling them in a video message that Maduro will not step down on his own and they \u201cmust make him leave.\u201d Maduro has asked his supporters to demonstrate Friday.",
      "But it is unclear whether anyone will heed calls to head to the streets with the increased security presence.",
      "On Tuesday, despite being the first day of school after the holidays, children were nowhere to be seen during morning rush hour in Caracas, and some schools remained closed.",
      "\u201cThere is tension. As soon as night falls, the city is like a ghost town,\" Caracas resident Mari Jimenez said. \u201cWe do not feel confident seeing so many police.\u201d",
      "Hours after announcing his son-in-law\u2019s kidnapping, Gonz\u00e1lez said he was continuing his multi-country tour with a stop in Panama.",
      "Kidnappings were commonplace in Venezuela at the end of last and beginning of this century, when criminals targeted the wealthy and a thriving middle class. But that type of crime decreased in recent years, as the country\u2019s economy came undone and Venezuelans began to emigrate.",
      "Recently, people have associated kidnappings with the government practice of detaining its real or perceived opponents without following the law. They are seen as part of a campaign to repress anti-government protests that broke out after the election results were announced.",
      "Electoral authorities in July declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts. However, the opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed Gonz\u00e1lez had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.",
      "The U.S.-based Carter Center, which Maduro\u2019s government invited to observe the presidential election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, who met with Gonz\u00e1lez on Monday in Washington, joined the calls for Tudares' immediate release. In a post on X, he said Tudares\u2019 situation is \u201ca new and unacceptable act of political pressure\" against Gonz\u00e1lez, whom \"the international community certified as the winner of the July elections, something that the regime continues to fail to refute with evidence.\u201d",

      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- More than 5,600 people were reported killed in Haiti last year as a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya struggles to contain rampant gang violence, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office. In addition, more than 2,200 people were reported injured and nearly 1,500 kidnapped, it said.",
      "\u201cThese figures alone cannot capture the absolute horrors being perpetrated in Haiti, but they show the unremitting violence to which people are being subjected,\u201d Volker T\u00fcrk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement.",
      "Among the victims are two journalists and a police officer killed when gunmen opened fire on a crowd that gathered on Christmas Eve for the much-anticipated reopening of Haiti\u2019s biggest public hospital, which gangs forced closed earlier this year.",
      "Other victims include more than 200 people killed in early December in a gang-controlled slum, many of them older Haitians, after a gang leader sought to avenge his son\u2019s death following Vodou rituals, according to the U.N. It was one of the biggest massacres reported in Port-au-Prince in recent history.",
      "Victims also include 315 suspected gang members or people associated with them who were lynched and more than 280 people killed by police in alleged summary executions, the U.N. said.",
      "\u201cIt has long been clear that impunity for human rights violations and abuses, as well as corruption, remain prevalent in Haiti,\u201d T\u00fcrk said.",

      "About 400 police officers from Kenya are leading the mission and were joined days ago by some 150 military police officers from Central America, the majority from Guatemala. Jamaica, Bahamas and Belize have sent a handful of personnel, while other nations including Barbados, Bangladesh and Chad have pledged to do the same, but it isn\u2019t clear when they would be deployed.",
      "The number remains far below the 2,500 officers expected for the mission.",
      "In another blow to Haiti\u2019s stability, Sunrise Airways announced Monday that it would temporarily suspend flights to and from the capital of Port-au-Prince, 85% of which is controlled by gangs.",
      "That leaves the country\u2019s main international airport without any commercial flights for the third time this year.",
      "Sunrise Airways did not provide a motive, saying only that the decision was based on circumstances out of its control, adding that the safety of passengers and crew members were a priority.",
      "In November, the airport in Port-au-Prince closed after gangs opened fire and struck three planes, including a Spirit Airlines plane that was mid-flight, injuring a flight attendant.",
      "While the airport has since reopened, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in December extended a ban on U.S. flights to Haiti\u2019s capital until March 12 out of safety.",
      "Overall, gang violence in recent years has left more than 700,000 homeless, with many crowding into makeshift and unsanitary shelters."

      "Marine Le Pen, thousands of kilometers (miles) away in the French territory of Mayotte, was inspecting the aftermath of destructive Cyclone Chido at the time of her father\u2019s death.",
      "Despite his exclusion from the party in 2015, Le Pen\u2019s divisive legacy endures, marking decades of French political history and shaping the trajectory of the far right.",
      "His death came at a crucial time for his daughter. She now faces a potential prison term and a ban on running for political office if convicted in an embezzling trial.",
      "A fixture for decades in French politics, the fiery Jean-Marie Le Pen was a wily political strategist and gifted orator who used his charisma to captivate crowds with his anti-immigration message.",
      "The portly, silver-haired son of a Breton fisherman viewed himself as a man with a mission \u2014 to keep France French under the banner of the National Front. Picking Joan of Arc as the party\u2019s patron saint, Le Pen made Islam, and Muslim immigrants, his primary target, blaming them for the economic and social woes of France.",
      "A former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire who fought in Indochina and Algeria, he led sympathizers into political and ideological battles with a panache that became a signature of his career.",
      "\u201cIf I advance, follow me; if I die, avenge me; if I shirk, kill me,\u201d Le Pen said at a 1990 party congress, reflecting the theatrical style that for decades fed the fervor of followers.",
      "Le Pen, who lost an eye in a street fight in his youth and for years wore a black eyepatch, was a constant force in French political life, impossible for politicians of the left or right to ignore.",
      "In election after election, he proved the spoiler, forcing rivals to scramble to counter him, and sometimes stoop to harvest far-right votes.",
      "Le Pen had recently been exempted from prosecution on health grounds from a high-profile trial over his party\u2019s suspected embezzlement of European Parliament funds that opened in September.",
      "French judicial authorities placed Le Pen under legal guardianship in February at the request of his family as his health declined, French media reported. He had been in frail health for some time.",
      "Le Pen was notably convicted in 1990 for a radio remark made three years earlier in which he referred to the Nazi gas chambers as a \u201cdetail in World War II history.\u201d In 2015, he repeated the remark, saying he \u201cdid not at all\u201d regret it, triggering the ire of his daughter \u2014 by then the party leader \u2014 and a new conviction in 2016.",
      "He also was convicted for a 1988 remark linking in a play on words a Cabinet minister with the Nazi crematory ovens, and for a 1989 comment blaming the \u201cJewish international\u201d for helping seed \u201cthis anti-national spirit.\u201d",
      "In another setback, Le Pen lost his European Parliament seat in 2002 for a year for assaulting a Socialist politician during a 1997 election campaign.",
      "More recently, Le Pen and 26 National Front officials, including his daughters Marine and Yann Le Pen, have been accused of using money destined for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who instead did political work for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s regulations. Jean-Marie Le Pen was deemed unfit to testify.",
      "Born June 20, 1928, in the Brittany village of Trinite-Sur-Mer, to Jean Le Pen, a fisherman who would die in World War II, and his wife Anne-Marie, Jean-Marie Le Pen proved an ambitious son attracted early on to the extreme right.",
      "Armed with law and political science degrees, Le Pen made his way to Paris, and at 27 became the youngest lawmaker in the National Assembly under the banner of the Union for the Defense of Shopkeepers and Artisans, run by Pierre Poujade. His career never strayed from the far-right path.",
      "In 1963, he and Leon Gaultier, who served in the Waffen SS, founded a company, SERP, that churned out political discourses. With the neo-fascist group New Order, Le Pen founded the National Front on Oct. 5, 1972.",
      "It would take more than a decade for the party to emerge as a political force \u2014 in a September 1983 municipal election when Jean-Pierre Stirbois won 16.7% of the votes in the town of Dreux, west of Paris.",
      "A year later, the party won 11% in European parliamentary elections and seated 10 deputies. The message was clear: France could no longer ignore Le Pen. The party\u2019s entry as a force in national politics came two years later in legislative elections that gave Le Pen\u2019s party 35 seats in France\u2019s National Assembly.",
      "By then, Le Pen had replaced the black eyepatch and begun polishing his scrappy image.",
      "In 1988, he startled the nation by taking 14% of the vote in the first round of presidential elections. Fourteen years later, in his fifth bid for the presidency, he outdid that \u2014 scoring 16.8%, coming second behind Jacques Chirac and reaching the two-man runoff.",
      "France shuddered, Europe trembled and the National Front gloated. But a Le Pen victory was not to be. In a rare joining of forces, supporters of the right and left poured into the streets of France in a massive show of solidarity against him. On May 5, 2002, Chirac was returned to office with a record 82% of the vote.",
      "Throughout the years, Le Pen\u2019s political line never wavered.",
      "In a 2003 speech, he said he wanted the notion of \u201cnational preference\u201d written into the French Constitution to limit employment, housing opportunities and other social assistance to French citizens. Immigration is \u201cthe greatest danger we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cMe? Racist? It\u2019s a gag, a gag,\u201d Le Pen once told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I\u2019m not for the melting pot. I\u2019m for the defense of one\u2019s culture. I\u2019d despair if I found the culture of Brooklyn in France.\u201d",
      "His private life was tumultuous.",
      "An explosion destroyed the family apartment building in 1976 but injured neither Le Pen nor his wife and three children.",
      "The French media relished recounting Le Pen\u2019s divorce saga from wife Pierrette Lalanne. In a reflection of that bitter separation, she famously posed for Playboy in 1987, partly dressed in a risque maid\u2019s costume. The magazine quoted her as saying she was responding to her husband\u2019s Playboy interview in which he said she could become a housekeeper if she needed money.",
      "He married for a second time in 1991, to Jeanne-Marie Paschos, known as Jany.",
      "Le Pen began laying the groundwork for his succession at a party congress in 2003, naming Marine \u2014 the youngest of his three daughters \u2014 to the post of vice president. In 2011, she became party president and in 2017 and 2022 reached the presidential runoff herself. Both times she lost to centrist Emmanuel Macron, but with a shrinking margin. She is considered a leading potential contender for the next presidential election in 2027.",
      "But her softer style and attempts to distance the party from the most extreme of his views soon brought her into conflict with her father. His refusal to desist from antisemitic provocations clashed with her bid to rid the National Front of its pariah status.",
      "She removed him from the party he co-founded, and in 2018 divested him of his title of honorary president-for-life. A few months later she changed the National Front name to National Rally as part of her strategy to renew the party\u2019s image.",
      "Her father called it the \u201ctoughest blow\u201d the party had faced since its founding.",
      "Throughout his life, Jean-Marie Le Pen refused to cede, or be silenced.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a moral authority for the movement ... and I don\u2019t have the habit of keeping my opinions to myself,\u201d Le Pen told The AP in 2014 as the father-daughter feud gained momentum.",
      "As Le Pen\u2019s health deteriorated in recent years, he was hospitalized several times, including after he suffered a stroke.",
      "Le Pen is survived by his wife and three daughters, Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine.",

      "Guinea is one of several West African countries where the military has taken power and delayed a return to civilian rule. Col. Mamadi Doumbouya, the junta leader in power since 2021, agreed in 2022 to launch a democratic transition after a Dec. 31, 2024, deadline.",

      "A decade after gunmen stormed the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in a deadly assault that shook France to its core, the nation paused Tuesday to honor the victims and grapple with the evolving challenges of free expression and terrorism",
      "PARIS -- A decade after gunmen stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in a deadly assault that shook France to its core and ignited a global outcry in defense of freedom of speech, the nation paused on Tuesday to honor the victims and renew its resolve to fight for liberty and democracy.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo led solemn tributes at the site of the attack, where 12 people, including some of France\u2019s most beloved cartoonists, were killed on January 7, 2015. Among those remembered was Ahmed Merabet, a police officer who was gunned down on the street while defending the newspaper.",
      "In a poignant ceremony, Macron stood with his wife, Brigitte, alongside former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who had steered France through the aftermath of the attacks. Macron joined police officers in laying wreaths of flowers against the wall of the former Charlie Hebdo headquarters in the 11th district and the gathering observed a minute of silence. A lone trumpet played, resonating through a neighborhood scarred by that day\u2019s bloodshed and later by the Bataclan massacre in November of the same year.",
      "The attacks plunged France into a year of unparalleled terror, beginning with the Charlie Hebdo assault and culminating in the coordinated November attacks, including the Bataclan tragedy. The nation was left grieving, yet public gatherings became acts of resilience, defying fear and standing firm against violence.",
      "The massacre at Charlie Hebdo, carried out by two brothers claiming allegiance to al-Qaida, signaled the dawn of a dark new chapter for France. A wave of extremist violence forced the country to reexamine its security measures. In the days following the attack, then German Chancellor Angela Merkel marched arm in arm with Hollande and other world leaders through the streets of Paris \u2014 a powerful display of unity in defense of freedom of expression that reverberated far beyond French borders.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, speaking on RTL Tuesday, acknowledged how far France has come. while warning of the persistent dangers. \u201cFrance has rearmed considerably, but the threat is still there,\u201d he said, pointing to both external dangers and the rise of homegrown radicalization.",
      "\u201cThe nature of the threat has changed,\u201d Retailleau added. \u201cIt is now primarily endogenous \u2014 young individuals radicalized through social media. Last year alone, our services foiled nine attacks, the highest number since 2017.\u201d",
      "The attacks\u2019 impact continued to extend beyond France itself. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz shared a message of solidarity on social media, writing, \u201c#JeSuisCharlie spread around the world after the barbaric attack on Charlie Hebdo 10 years ago. Today, as then, we share the grief of our French friends. The attack targeted our shared values of freedom and democracy\u2014we will never accept this.\u201d",
      "The attack on Charlie Hebdo, carried out in retaliation for the newspaper\u2019s irreverent caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, ignited fierce global debates about the limits of free expression. In the days that followed, millions marched in solidarity, brandishing pens and signs declaring, Je Suis Charlie (I am Charlie).",
      "But 10 years on, the unity of that moment has given way to deeper divisions. Charlie Hebdo said its research shows that while a majority of French still believe in the fundamental right to caricature, younger generations increasingly criticize satire they see as divisive or insensitive, particularly toward marginalized communities.",
      "\u201cAre we all still Charlie?\u201d one television special asked. For some, the answer is a resounding yes \u2014 a tribute to those who paid the ultimate price for freedom of expression. For others, French media say, it\u2019s a more complicated question.",
      "The newspaper remains unapologetic. Its 10th-anniversary edition features a cover cartoon of a reader perched on an AK-47, captioned \u201cIndestructible.\u201d In an editorial, the magazine\u2019s director, Laurent Sourisseau, known as \u201cRiss,\u201d defended the power of satire. \u201cIf you want to laugh, it means you want to live,\u201d he wrote."

      "He said authorities are in talks with the protesters to persuade them to end the protest.",
      "People in energy-starved Pakistan often face hourslong power cuts, especially during the summer, but residents in Aliabad say they have been experiencing up to 20-hour power outages in the midst of a harsh winter.",
      "The protest comes at a time when Pakistan is hoping to attract greater Chinese investment to revive its ailing economy under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which includes enhancing bilateral trade and building and improving roads and rail systems to link western China\u2019s Xinjiang region to Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.",
      "CPEC is part of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative to increase trade by building infrastructure around the world.",
      "Imran Ali, President of the Gilgit Baltistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry told local media that 700 trucks carrying various items for China were stuck at a dry port because of the blockade of the road, while the closure of the road is also affecting the supply of goods to and from the region across Pakistan.",

      "The miners were trapped on Monday morning in the Umrangso area in Dimapur Hasao district, some 125 miles (200 kilometers) south of the state capital, Guwahati.",
      "The workers are \u201cfeared trapped 300 feet below the ground after water gushed in from a nearby unused mine. We are mobilizing resources to rescue them,\u201d said Kaushik Rai, a local government minister who is monitoring the rescue at the site.",
      "Authorities brought army soldiers and a national disaster management team to the area to assist in the ongoing operation.",

      "Taiwan is beginning three days of military drills as concerns rise over potential cuts to the island's defense budget",
      "HSINCHU, Taiwan -- Taiwan began three days of military drills on Tuesday as concerns rose over potential cuts to the defense budget due to legislative wrangling between the island's two major political parties.",
      "The drills began in the north with tank maneuvering at a base in Hsinchu featuring outmoded CM-11 tanks, which are gradually being replaced by newly purchased Abrams M1A2T from the U.S. The replacement marks a huge upgrade despite some complaints over the weight of the new tanks and their likely effectiveness at preventing a possible Chinese landing.",
      "Troops arrived on armored personnel carriers, while Apache and S-70 helicopters whirled overhead, providing reconnaissance and covering fire.",
      "With the equipment Taiwan currently operates, the communication officer is on the ground to coordinate airborne attacks, said Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng of the 542 Armored Brigade in Hsinchu county just south of the capital of Taipei. That allows them to guide the helicopters so that \u201cground fire and airborne fire are synchronized,\u201d Chuang said.",
      "On Wednesday, the army will show off its Patriot III anti-missile system aimed at countering one of China\u2019s most potent weapons against the island of 23 million. And on Thursday, anti-submarine exercises will be held off of Taiwan\u2019s largest port of Kaohsiung, considered China's best conduit for resupplying its troops should it establish a beachhead in the heavily defended region.",
      "The annual drills are held in the run-up to the Lunar New Year holiday to reassure the population of Taiwan\u2019s ability to meet China\u2019s threats and to boost recruitment. Taiwan has a backlog of orders from the U.S. for about $20 billion in weapons systems, while it upgrades its M-16 fighters and develops its own submarines. It has also extended compulsory military service to one year.",
      "However, the government has warned that new legal amendments being considered could force a 28% cut in the defense budget by altering the way funds are distributed between the central and local governments.",
      "That in turn could reduce the willingness of the U.S. and its allies such as Japan and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of an armed clash with China, National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu told legislators last month.",
      "The legislation is being pushed by the main opposition Nationalist Party, which has joined with the tiny Taiwan People's Party to oppose the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's legislative agenda.",
      "Taiwan currently spends about 2.4% of its GDP, or roughly $20 billion, on the military annually.",
      "China has responded furiously to all U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, saying unification with the island is inevitable and warning that Washington is \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d However, apart from regularly sending planes and warships into areas near the island, it has done little more than blacklist companies and executives involved in the production and sales of such equipment.",
      "Neither military intimidation, economic coercion nor appeals to their common Chinese ancestry seem to be working on Taiwan's population, the vast majority of whom favor the current status of de-facto independence."

      "ACAPULCO, Mexico -- About 100 migrants from various countries wandered directionless and disoriented through the streets of the troubled Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.",
      "After walking for a couple weeks through southern Mexico with hundreds of other migrants, they accepted an offer from immigration officials to come to Acapulco with the idea they could continue their journey north toward the U.S. border. Instead, they found themselves stuck on Monday.",

      "The policy of \u201cdispersion and exhaustion\u201d has become the center of the Mexican government\u2019s immigration policy in recent years and last year succeeded in significantly reducing the number of migrants reaching the U.S. border, said Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, former chief of Mexico\u2019s immigration agency.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current administration hopes that the lower numbers will give them some defense from Trump\u2019s pressures, said Guillen, who left the administration of former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador after Trump threatened to impose tariffs over migration during his first presidency.",
      "Acapulco would seem to be a strange destination for migrants. Once a crown jewel of Mexico\u2019s tourism industry, the city now suffers under the thumb of organized crime and is still struggling to climb back after taking a direct hit from devastating Hurricane Otis in 2023.",
      "On Monday, Mexican tourists enjoyed the final hours of their holiday beach vacations while migrants slept in the street or tried to find ways to resume their journeys north.",
      "\u201cImmigration (officials) told us they were going to give us a permit to transit the country freely for 10, 15 days and it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d said a 28-year-old Venezuelan, Ender Antonio Casta\u00f1eda. \u201cThey left us dumped here without any way to get out. They won\u2019t sell us (bus) tickets, they won\u2019t sell us anything.\u201d",
      "Casta\u00f1eda, like thousands of other migrants, had left the southern city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border. More than a half dozen caravans of about 1,500 migrants each have set out from Tapachula in recent weeks, but none of them made it very far.",
      "Authorities let them walk for days until they\u2019re exhausted and then offer to bus them to various cities where they say their immigration status will be reviewed, which could mean any number of things.",
      "Some have landed in Acapulco, where about a dozen sleep at a Catholic church near the immigration agency offices.",
      "Several dozen gathered outside the offices Monday looking for information, but no one would tell them anything. Casta\u00f1eda, who had just received money from his family and was desperate to leave, picked a van driver he judged to be the most trustworthy among various offering rides for up to five times the normal price for a bus ticket to Mexico City",
      "Some migrants have discovered the permits authorities give them allow them to travel only within the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. Other migrants have better luck.",
      "On Sunday, the latest migrant caravan broke up after hundreds received free transit permits to go anywhere in Mexico for a specified number of days.",
      "Cuban Dayani S\u00e1nchez, 33, and her husband were among them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a little scared by the lack of safety getting on buses, that they\u2019re going to stop us,\u201d she said. Mexico\u2019s drug cartels frequently target migrants for kidnapping and extortion, though many migrants say authorities extort them too.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum insists her immigration strategy has a \u201chumanitarian\u201d focus, and has allowed more migrants to leave southernmost Mexico. But some migration advocates note that migrants are being taken to violent areas.",
      "It\u2019s a concern shared by the Rev. Leopoldo Morales, the priest at the Catholic church in Acapulco near the immigration agency office.",
      "He said that in November two or three immigration agency buses arrived with migrants, including entire families. Last weekend, two more arrived carrying all adults.",
      "Even though Acapulco isn\u2019t on the usual migration route and was unprepared to receive migrants, several priests have coordinated support for them with water, food and clothing. \u201cWe know they\u2019re going through a very difficult time, with a lot of needs, they arrive without money,\u201d Morales said.",
      "Migrants quickly realize that finding work in Acapulco is difficult. After Otis\u2019 destruction, the federal government sent hundreds of soldiers and National Guard troops to provide security and start reconstruction. Last year, another storm, John, brought widespread flooding.",
      "But violence in Acapulco hasn\u2019t relented.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Israel and Hamas once again appear to be inching toward a ceasefire that could wind down the 15-month war in Gaza and bring home dozens of Israelis held hostage there.",
      "Both Israel and Hamas are under pressure from outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump to reach a deal before the Jan. 20 inauguration. But the sides have come close before, only to have talks collapse over various disagreements.",
      "The latest round of negotiations has bogged down over the names of hostages to be released in a first phase, according to Israeli, Egyptian and Hamas officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing ongoing negotiations.",
      "Israel wants assurances that the hostages are alive, while Hamas says that after months of heavy fighting, it isn't sure who is alive or dead.",
      "Other hurdles remain.",
      "The first phase, expected to last for six to eight weeks, would also include a halt in fighting, a release of Palestinian prisoners and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to the officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war, and talks on reconstruction and who will govern Gaza going forward.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t get it across the finish line in the next two weeks, I\u2019m confident that it will get to completion at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Seoul on Monday.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the key issues holding up a deal:",
      "During its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages into Gaza. A truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year.",
      "Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza \u2014 at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity.",
      "The first batch of hostages to be released is expected to be made up mostly of women, older people and people with medical conditions, according to the Israeli, Egyptian and Hamas officials.",
      "On Monday, a Hamas official shared with AP a list of 34 names of hostages it said were slated for release. An Egyptian official confirmed the list had been the focus of recent discussions.",
      "But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the names were from a list Israel had submitted months ago. \u201cAs of now, Israel has not received any confirmation or comment by Hamas regarding the status of the hostages appearing on the list,\u201d it said.",
      "A second Hamas official on Monday released a list of 14 names the group claimed Israel had removed from consideration after they were approved by Hamas and substituted with other names. Israel did not respond for a request for comment, but it has pronounced the 14 people dead.",
      "An Israeli official said the current impasse was due to Hamas' refusal to provide information on the conditions of the hostages, while another official said the departure of the head of the Mossad intelligence agency for negotiations in Qatar was on hold.",
      "A Hamas official, meanwhile, said that \u201cno one knows\u201d the conditions of all of the hostages. Hamas officials have said that due to the war, they cannot provide a full accounting until there is a truce.",
      "Since the war began, over 45,800 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of those killed. They do not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Families of hostages reacted angrily to reports of the phased approach, saying the government should instead be pursuing a deal that releases all the captives at once. They say time is running out to bring people home safely.",
      "\u201cThis morning, I and everyone in Israel woke up and discovered that the state of Israel has put together a Schindler's List \u2014 34 people who will be able to hug their families again, and 66 others whose fate will be sealed,\u201d said Yotam Cohen, whose brother Nimrod, an Israeli soldier held hostage, did not appear on the published list.",
      "Netanyahu has said he supports a partial deal that pauses the war, but he has rejected Hamas' demands for a full Israeli withdrawal that would end the war. Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until he achieves \u201ctotal victory\u201d \u2014 including the destruction of Hamas' military capabilities.",
      "Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas. But the group continues to stage attacks in Gaza and to fire rockets into Israel. That could portend an open-ended war that could drag on for months or years.",
      "The Hostages Forum, a grassroots group representing many hostage families, said it was time for a comprehensive deal.",
      "\u201cWe know more than half are still alive and need immediate rehabilitation, while those who were murdered must be returned for proper burial,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have no more time to waste. A hostage ceasefire agreement must be sealed now!\u201d",
      "As part of the deal, Israel is expected to free hundreds of imprisoned Palestinians, including dozens who were convicted in bloody attacks.",
      "Israel has a history of large-scale prisoner releases, and hundreds were freed in the November 2023 deal. But the sides have disagreed over the exact number and names of the prisoners to be freed. Hamas wants high-profile prisoners included. Israeli officials have ruled out the release of Marwan Barghouti, who tops Hamas' wish list.",
      "Netanyahu's governing coalition includes hardliners who oppose such releases, with some even pledging to quit the government if too many concessions are made. They point to a 2011 prisoner release that included the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks who was killed by Israel in October.",
      "The war has displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people, according to U.N. estimates, with the hard-hit northern sector of the territory largely emptied of its prewar population.",
      "During the first phase of the developing deal, Israel is expected to withdraw troops from Palestinian population centers and allow some of the displaced to return home. But the extent of the pullback and the number of people allowed to return must still be worked out, the officials say.",

      "Austria could soon have its first government led by the far right since World War II",
      "VIENNA, Austria -- A party that advocates an end to economic sanctions against Russia and has called for the \u201cre-migration of uninvited foreigners\u201d could soon give Austria its first government led by the far right since World War II, with a leader who has a provocative style at its helm.",
      "Attempts to form a government without the far-right Freedom Party collapsed in recent days, more than three months after it won a parliamentary election. President Alexander Van der Bellen on Monday tasked its leader, Herbert Kickl, with trying to put together a coalition in the coming weeks or months.",
      "The Freedom Party was founded in 1956 by former Nazis and, over the decades, has become an established political force in Austria. It has led provincial governments and served as a junior partner in national governments \u2014 but never led a national administration until now.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the stakes if Kickl succeeds in forming a new government:",
      "The Freedom Party has come back strongly since its last stint in government ended in a scandal in 2019, benefiting from rising voter anger about immigration and inflation.",
      "In September's legislative elections, the party won 28.8% of the vote, a nearly 13-point gain from four years earlier. The governing conservative Austrian People's Party came in second with 26.3% and the Social Democrats third with 21.1%.",
      "It's usual for Austrian elections to result in coalitions, but this result was particularly complicated because none of the other party leaders at the time were prepared to go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl.",
      "The president asked outgoing Chancellor Karl Nehammer to try to set up a new government, but talks on potential coalitions without the far right stumbled over how to get Austria's budget in shape and revive the economy. On Saturday, Nehammer said he would resign.",
      "Van der Bellen then called in Kickl \u2013 a sharp-tongued provocateur who last year mocked the now 80-year-old president as \u201ca mummy\u201d and \u201csenile\u201d \u2013 for talks that led to Monday\u2019s offer for the Freedom Party to try to form a new government.",
      "The 56-year-old is known for overstepping accepted boundaries and shocking the political establishment.",
      "A former speechwriter for late former far-right leader J\u00f6rg Haider and a longtime campaign strategist who coined catchy and provocative anti-immigration slogans, Kickl was interior minister from 2017 to 2019 when the Freedom Party was a junior partner in a coalition government under conservative then-Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. He became the Freedom Party leader in June 2021.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kickl joined some other critics of the World Health Organization in advocating use of ivermectin, a medicine for treatment of parasitic worms in animals, to treat the disease.",
      "The Freedom Party over the years has attracted a neo-Nazi fringe, but it has publicly disassociated itself from decades of covert antisemitism. In 2015, a party lawmaker was expelled for backing an antisemitic comment on social media and Kickl, the party's general secretary at the time, said she had \u201ccrossed a red line.\u201d",
      "While interior minister in 2018, Kickl denied any intention of being provocative when he said asylum-seekers in Austria might be held \u201cin a concentrated way in one place\u201d as authorities assessed their applications.",
      "Years after financial crisis drove a wedge in the European bloc, and nearly five years after Brexit, the European Union is facing a new sign of internal discord: The 27-member bloc has been a stalwart supporter of Ukraine, but unity is fraying.",
      "Austria, which has a longstanding policy of military neutrality, has not provided weapons to Ukraine.",
      "Far-right movements have been on the rise in the EU in recent years. The U.S presidential election victory of Donald Trump \u2013 who shares many of their values and policy positions \u2013 in November has further emboldened them.",
      "But concern lingers about the rise of hard-right movements in Europe.",
      "Alon Ischay of the Austrian Union of Jewish Students said the turn to Kickl was \u201cimportant\" and expressed concerns about how the Freedom Party leader has used the term \u201cVolkskanzler\u201d \u2014 the people\u2019s chancellor \u2014 which was used by the Nazis to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Kickl has rejected the comparison.",
      "\u201cThat this person might get the mandate to form a government is unacceptable to us,\u201d said Ischay, who was among hundreds of protesters outside the presidential palace on Monday.",
      "The Freedom Party is pro-Russian and skeptical about EU mandates, calling for a \u201cFortress Austria\u201d that can wrest decision-making power from Brussels. The party\u2019s rise has coincided with rising voter anger about immigration and inflation.",
      "The Freedom Party is part of a right-wing populist alliance in the European Parliament, Patriots for Europe.",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, seen by many as the most pro-Russia leader of any EU country, hailed \u201can historic victory\u201d for the Freedom Party after Austria's elections in September.

      "The U.S. Justice Department is suing several large landlords for allegedly coordinating to keep Americans\u2019 rents high",
      "DENVER -- The U.S. Justice Department is suing several large landlords for allegedly coordinating to keep Americans\u2019 rents high by using both an algorithm to help set rents and privately sharing sensitive information with their competitors to boost profits.",
      "The lawsuit arrives as U.S. renters continue to struggle under a merciless housing market, with incomes failing to keep up with rent increases. The latest figures show that half of American renters spent more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities in 2022, an all-time high.",
      "That means exhausting, day-to-day decisions between medications, groceries, school supplies and rent. It means eviction notices and protracted court cases in which children face the highest eviction rates, with 1.5 million evicted each year, according to Princeton University's Eviction Lab.",
      "While the housing crisis has been assigned several causes, including a slump in homes built over the last decade, the Justice Department's lawsuit claims major landlords are playing a part.",
      "The department, along with 10 states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Colorado and California, is accusing six landlords that collectively operate more than 1.3 million units in 43 states and the District of Columbia of scheming to avoid lowering rents.",
      "The landlord Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC, a defendant in the case, declined a request for comment from The Associated Press, but published an unsigned statement on its website.",
      "\u201cGreystar has and will conduct its business with the utmost integrity. At no time did Greystar engage in any anti-competitive practices,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves in this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit accuses the landlords of sharing sensitive data on rents and occupancy with competing firms via email, phone calls or in groups. The information shared allegedly included renewal rates, how often they accept an algorithm's price recommendation, the use of concessions such as offering one month free, and even their approach to pricing for the next quarter.",
      "The Justice Department said one of the six landlords agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. The proposed settlement would restrict how the company can use their competitors' data and algorithms to set rents.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s action against RealPage and six major landlords seeks to end their practice of putting profits over people and make housing more affordable for millions of people across the country,\u201d said Doha Mekki, the acting assistant attorney general for the department\u2019s antitrust division in Tuesday\u2019s press release.",
      "Those landlords were added to an existing lawsuit against RealPage, which runs an algorithm that recommends rental prices to landlords. Prosecutors say the algorithm uses sensitive competitive information, allowing landlords to align their prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents.",
      "Jennifer Bowcock, RealPage's senior vice president for communications, said in a statement to the AP that their software is used on fewer than 10% of rental units in the U.S., and that their price recommendations are used less than half the time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s past time to stop scapegoating RealPage \u2014 and now our customers -- for housing affordability problems when the root cause of high housing costs is the under-supply of housing,\u201d Bowcock said.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Musk start to align himself much more obviously with an international movement of the far right,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201dIf you look at the kinds of people who Musk himself is boosting on his platform \u2026 he\u2019s increasingly started to assemble a group of different right-wing influencers, many of them with large followings, and presenting their evidence as a basis for his interventions into European politics.\u201d",

      "Musk\u2019s recent focus is on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns several years ago, in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of mostly white girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration and Islam.",
      "Musk has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England\u2019s director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 \u2014 a charge Starmer strongly denies.",
      "\u201cStarmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,\u201d Musk tweeted.",
      "Chadwick said \u201cthere\u2019s been a hesitancy on the part of the political elite in the U.K. to engage\u201d with Musk\u2019s \u201cincredibly inflammatory remarks.\u201d But Starmer changed tack Monday, condemning \u201clies and misinformation\u201d and accusing U.K. Conservative politicians who have echoed some of Musk\u2019s points of \u201camplifying what the far right are saying.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to reject a bid by Nippon Steel to acquire U.S. Steel on national security grounds isn\u2019t the first time friction over trade and investment has irked Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia.",
      "There have been plenty of scraps over trade in the past few decades, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken sought to smooth ruffled feathers in a visit to Tokyo on Tuesday.",
      "Nippon Steel Chief Executive Eiji Hashimoto said the top Japanese steelmaker was standing firm on its proposed $15 billion friendly acquisition. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration\u2019s decision.",
      "But the assertion that the proposed deal could threaten U.S. national security has stung.",
      "Many in Japan see the decision as a betrayal by Washington after decades of U.S. pressure to lift barriers to investment and trade. The timing doesn\u2019t help, with Japanese businesses already bracing for potentially damaging tariff hikes once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was blunt in warning that spoiling the deal might hurt Japanese investment in the U.S.",
      "Here are some key issues at stake:",
      "While in Tokyo in a farewell tour before Biden leaves office, Blinken told reporters he believes that during the past four years the alliance with Japan has \u201cgrown stronger than it's ever been before.\u201d Japan and the U.S. are mutually the largest investors in each other's economies, he noted, \u201cstrengthening the foundation for many years to come.\u201d Japan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the U.S. Steel decision came up during Blinken's meeting with Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. But it said only that the two sides had \u201creaffirmed the importance of Japan-U.S. economic relations, including investment in the U.S. by Japanese companies.\u201d",
      "Before Blinken's visit, Ishiba, who has struggled to build support and momentum since he took office in October, was emphatic.",
      "\u201cAs for why national security was cited as an issue, it must be clearly explained. Otherwise, future discussions on the matter will come to naught,\u201d he said Monday. \"No matter how much we are an ally, I believe that the points I have just made are extremely important for our future relations.\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact that Japanese industry has voiced concerns about future investment between the U.S. and Japan. We have to take this very seriously.\u201d",
      "Japan's Trade Minister Yoji Muto said the decision was \u201cvery regrettable.\u201d Headlines in Japanese newspapers mainly focused on Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel's plan to fight the ruling in court.",
      "Japan is the biggest and most important U.S. ally in Asia, a relationship forged during the U.S. occupation following Japan's 1945 defeat in World War II. Nearly 63,000 troops are stationed at dozens of facilities across the country and Washington has urged Japan to build up its own defense capabilities as a counterweight to China's growing influence and military power.",
      "Japan counts on the U.S. to provide an umbrella of defense against its neighbors China, Russia and North Korea. Some critics have chafed at the decision to reject Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, saying Washington was treating Japan like it does China, a potential adversary.",
      "\u201cWhen is an ally not a partner? Apparently when a Japanese company seeks to purchase an iconic U.S. corporation,\u201d The newspaper The Japan Times said in an editorial. It described the concerns over national security as \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d adding \u201cTrust has been greatly damaged and it is unclear what will be required to undo the harm.\u201d",
      "Biden and Trump have both supported higher tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from China, saying they are needed to insulate American producers from unfair trade practices and a flood of cheap imports. In 2018, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports of Japanese steel on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. The Biden administration agreed to a deal in 2022 to allow a certain quota of some steel products to be imported tariff-free. Any above that amount is subject to the 25% tariff.",
      "Today's trade frictions follow decades of negotiations that have led Japan to open its markets much more widely to foreign goods and services, transforming its retailing from mostly old-style department stores and mom-and-pop shops into outlet malls and big discount stores. Such \u201cgai-atsu,\u201d or foreign pressure, led Japanese automakers and other manufacturers chose to invest in U.S. factories, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel contend their deal would save American jobs, and business groups on both sides have objected to seeing the deal fall through as part of a broad shift in recent years away from greater openness."

      "Syria\u2019s new foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, has traveled to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in recent days. The Gulf countries are likely to be key to funding Syria\u2019s reconstruction after nearly 14 years of civil war that preceded Assad's ouster.",
      "On Tuesday, al-Shibani traveled to Jordan to meet with his counterpart in Amman. Jordan's foreign ministry said the officials were set to discuss \u201cmechanisms of cooperation in many areas including borders, security, energy, transportation, water, trade and other vital sectors.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe new situation in Syria has also ended the threats that previously threatened the security of the Kingdom (of Jordan), with regard to drugs and Captagon, and we pledge that this thing has ended and will not return again,\" al-Shibani said in a joint news conference with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi.",
      "Al-Safadi said that his country supports the Syrian people as they work to \u201crebuild their homeland on the foundations that preserve its security, stability, sovereignty and unity and fulfill the rights of its people,\u201d adding that Jordan is \u201cready to provide electricity to our brothers immediately, and we are also ready to work together to provide gas.\u201d",

      "Now Trudeau's Liberal Party must find a new leader while dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods and with Canada's election just months away.",
      "Trudeau said Monday he plans to stay on as prime minister until a new party leader is chosen.",
      "He could not recover after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, resigned from the Cabinet last month.",
      "Trudeau, the 53-year-old scion of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s most famous prime ministers, became deeply unpopular with voters over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing as well as surging immigration.",
      "A new Canadian leader is unlikely to be named before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20.",
      "The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. Trump keeps calling Canada the 51st state and has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs into the U.S. \u2014 even though far fewer of them cross the border from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs.",
      "Trump also remains preoccupied with the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, erroneously calling it a subsidy. Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. But she noted that a third of what Canada sells to the U.S. are energy exports and that there is a deficit when oil prices are high.",
      "If Trump applies tariffs, a trade war looms. Canada has vowed to retaliate.",
      "The Liberals need to elect a new leader before Parliament resumes March 24 because all three opposition parties say they will bring down the Liberal government in a no-confidence vote at the first opportunity, which would trigger an election. The new leader might not be prime minister for long.",

      "It\u2019s not often that central bank governors get compared to rock stars. But Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, was considered just that in 2012 when he was named the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. The appointment of a Canadian won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered faster than many other countries from the 2008 financial crisis. He gained a reputation along the way as a tough regulator.",
      "Few people in the world have Carney\u2019s qualifications. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who is widely credited with helping Canada dodge the worst of the 2008 global economic crisis and helping the U.K. manage Brexit. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister but lacks political experience.",
      "Freeland is also a front-runner. Trudeau told Freeland last month he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. An official close to Freeland said Freeland couldn\u2019t continue serving as a minister knowing she no longer enjoyed Trudeau's confidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The person added it's far too early to make declarations but said Freeland would talk to her colleagues this week and discuss next steps.",
      "After she resigned, Trump called Freeland \u201ctotally toxic\" and \"not at all conducive to making deals.\" Freeland is many things that would seem to irritate Trump: a liberal Canadian former journalist. She is a globalist who sits on the board of the World Economic Forum. Freeland, who is of Ukrainian heritage, also has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia.",
      "Another possible candidate is the new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. LeBlanc was Trudeau's babysitter when Trudeau was a child.",
      "Recent polls suggest the Liberals' chances of winning the next election look slim. In the latest poll by Nanos, the Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 47% to 21%.",
      "\u201cTrudeau\u2019s announcement might help the Liberals in the polls in the short run and, once a new leader is selected, things could improve further at least for a little while but that would not be so hard because, right now, they\u2019re so low in the polls,\u201d said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "\u201cMoreover, because Trudeau waited so long to announce his resignation, this will leave little time to his successor and the party to prepare for early elections,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "Many analysts say Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre will form the next government. Poilievre, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who blamed Canada\u2019s cost of living crisis on Trudeau. The 45-year-old Poilievre is a career politician who attracted large crowds during his run for his party's leadership. He has vowed to scrap a carbon tax and defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation."

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday set maximum levels for lead in baby foods like jarred fruits and vegetables, yogurts and dry cereal, part of an effort to cut young kids' exposure to the toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological problems.",
      "The agency issued final guidance that it estimated could reduce lead exposure from processed baby foods by about 20% to 30%. The limits are voluntary, not mandatory, for food manufacturers, but they allow the FDA to take enforcement action if foods exceed the levels.",
      "It's part of the FDA's ongoing effort to \u201creduce dietary exposure to contaminants, including lead, in foods to as low as possible over time, while maintaining access to nutritious foods,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Consumer advocates, who have long sought limits on lead in children's foods, welcomed the guidance first proposed two years ago, but said it didn't go far enough.",
      "\u201cFDA's actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cHowever, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards.\u201d",
      "The new limits on lead for children younger than 2 don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, which some research has shown contain higher levels of lead. And they don't limit other metals such as cadmium that have been detected in baby foods.",
      "Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, called the limits \"virtually meaningless because they\u2019re based more on industry feasibility and not on what would best protect public health.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for baby food maker Gerber said the company's products meet the limits.",
      "There\u2019s no safe level of lead exposure for children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The metal causes \u201cwell-documented health effects,\u201d including brain and nervous system damage and slowed growth and development. However, lead occurs naturally in some foods and comes from pollutants in air, water and soil, which can make it impossible to eliminate entirely.",
      "The FDA guidance sets a lead limit of 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals. The guidance covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes.",
      "The new guidance comes more than a year after lead-tainted pouches of apple cinnamon puree sickened more than 560 children in the U.S. between October 2023 and April 2024, according to the CDC.",
      "The levels of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum. Officials stressed that the agency doesn't need guidance to take action on foods that violate the law.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has slammed a decision by the U.S. Treasury to sanction a Beijing-based cybersecurity company for its alleged role in multiple hacking incidents targeting critical U.S. infrastructure, while the Chinese cyber security agency complained Monday of attacks on Chinese networks.",
      "Asked about the sanctions against Beijing-based Integrity Technology Group, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the country has cracked down on cyber attacks and that Washington was using the issue to \u201cdefame and smear China.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor some time now, the U.S. side has been playing up so-called Chinese cyber attacks and has even initiated illegal unilateral sanctions against China,\u201d Guo said. \u201cChina firmly opposes this and will take necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "Integrity Technology Group said the move by Washington had \u201cno factual basis.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe company firmly opposes the U.S. Treasury Department's unwarranted accusations and Illegal unilateral sanctions on the company,\u201d the company, also known as Yongxin Zhicheng Technology Group, said in a statement Monday to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.",
      "The China National Cyber Security Information Center said it had discovered attacks from various malicious websites and foreign IP addresses, including some in California and Florida. It also reported attacks from the Netherlands, Singapore, Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam using Trojan programs, botnets, phishing, theft of intellectual property and violations of privacy.",
      "\u201cThey pose a major threat to China's domestic networked units and internet users and some activities have been suspected of criminal offenses,\u201d the center said in a notice on its WeChat social media site.",
      "On Friday, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control hit Integrity Technology with sanctions that block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans. It cited alleged multiple hacks against U.S. victims, including incidents attributed to Flax Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored campaign that targets U.S. critical infrastructure.",
      "The sanctions did not appear to be related to an incident in which the Treasury Department reported that Chinese hackers had remotely accessed several of its workstations and unclassified documents in a major breach of cybersecurity.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of that problem on Dec. 8, when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \u201cused by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\u201d to workers.",
      "U.S. officials are grappling with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage blitz known as Salt Typhoon that they say gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "Late last month, officials said at least eight telecommunications companies, as well as dozens of nations, had been affected by Salt Typhoon.",
      "Integrity Technology said the sanctions would not adversely affect its business since it does not operate in the U.S. and has no assets there. It added that it abides by all laws and regulations and that it \u201chas always adhered to the corporate vision and mission of bringing a sense of security to the world.\u201d",

      "Incoming first lady Melania Trump will be the subject of a new documentary directed by Brett Ratner and distributed by Amazon Prime Video",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Incoming first lady Melania Trump will be the subject of a new documentary directed by Brett Ratner and distributed by Amazon Prime Video. The streaming arm of the tech giant got exclusive licensing rights for a streaming and theatrical release later this year, the company said Sunday.",
      "Filming is already underway on the documentary. The company said in a statement that the film will give viewers an \u201cunprecedented behind-the-scenes look\u201d at Melania Trump and also promised a \u201ctruly unique story.\u201d",
      "The former and now future first lady also released a self-titled memoir late last year. Her husband takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "The film is the latest connection between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump. The company in December announced plans to donate $1 million to the President-elect\u2019s inauguration fund, and said that it would also stream Trump\u2019s inauguration on its Prime Video service, a separate in-kind donation worth another $1 million.",
      "The two men had been at odds in the past. During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. But he\u2019s struck a more conciliatory tone recently as Amazon and other tech companies seek to improve their relationship with the incoming president.",
      "In December, Bezos expressed some excitement about potential regulatory cutbacks in the coming years and said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Bezos in October did not allow the Post to endorse a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and to protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper. This weekend, a cartoonist quit her job after an editor rejected her sketch of the newspaper\u2019s owner and other media executives bowing before the president-elect.",
      "The film also marks the first project that Ratner has directed since he was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, including actor Olivia Munn, in the early days of the #MeToo reckoning in November 2017. Ratner, whose lawyer denied the allegations, directed the \u201cRush Hour\u201d film series, \u201cRed Dragon\u201d and \u2019\u2019X-Men: The Last Stand.\u201d",
      "Fernando Sulichin, an Argentine filmmaker, is executive producing the film, which began shooting in December.",
      "Melania Trump, Donald Trump\u2019s third wife, has been an enigmatic figure since her husband announced he was running in the 2016 election. She had sought to maintain her privacy even as she served as first lady, focusing on raising their son, Barron, and promoting her \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative to support the \u201csocial, emotional, and physical health of children.\u201d",
      "While she appeared at her husband\u2019s campaign launch event for 2024 and attended the closing night of the Republican National Convention this summer, she has otherwise stayed off the campaign trail, though the demands of again being first lady may dictate a higher public profile after Inauguration Day."

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is set to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Sunday plans to sign into law a measure that boosts Social Security payments for current and former public employees, affecting nearly 3 million people who receive pensions from their time as teachers, firefighters, police officers and in other public service jobs.",
      "Advocates say the Social Security Fairness Act rights a decades-old disparity, though it will also put strain on Social Security Trust Funds, which face a looming insolvency crisis.",
      "The bill rescinds two provisions \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset \u2014 that limit Social Security benefits for recipients if they get retirement payments from other sources, including public retirement programs from a state or local government.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimated that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025. Ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, according to the CBO. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "Those amounts would increase over time with Social Security\u2019s regular cost-of-living adjustments.",
      "The change is to payments from January 2024 and beyond, meaning the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments. The measure as passed by Congress says the Social Security commissioner \"shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. It's not immediately clear how this will happen or whether people affected will have to take any action.",
      "Edward Kelly, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, said firefighters across the country are \u201cexcited to see the change \u2014 we've righted a 40-year wrong.\u201d Kelly said the policy was \u201cfar more egregious for surviving spouses of firefighters who paid their own quotas into Social Security but were victimized by the government pension system.\u201d",
      "The IAFF has roughly 320,000 members, which does not include hundreds of thousands of retirees who will benefit from the change.",
      "\u201cNow firefighters who get paid very little can now afford to actually retire,\" Kelly said.",
      "Sherrod Brown, who as an Ohio senator pushed for the proposal for years, lost his reelection bid in November. Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, thanked Brown for his advocacy.",
      "\u201cOver two million public service workers will finally be able to access the Social Security benefits they spent their careers paying into,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"Many will finally be able to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of service.\u201d",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the law is \u201ca historic victory that will improve the lives of educators, first responders, postal workers and others who dedicate their lives to public service in their communities.\u201d",
      "And while some Republicans such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins supported the legislation, others, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against it. \u201cWe caved to the pressure of the moment instead of doing this on a sustainable basis,\u201d Tillis told The Associated Press last month.",
      "Still, Republican supporters of the bill said there was a rare opportunity to address what they described as an unfair section of federal law that hurts public service retirees.",
      "The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social Security benefits.",
      "The policy changes from the new law will heap more administrative work on the Social Security Administration, which is already at its lowest staffing level in decades. The agency, currently under a hiring freeze, has a staff of about 56,645 \u2014 the lowest level in over 50 years even as it serves more people than ever.",
      "The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released last May said the program\u2019s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The new law will hasten the program\u2019s insolvency date by about half a year. ___",

    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees."

    "story": [
      "The Venezuelan opposition leader who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election has kicked off a tour of Latin America",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, who the United States recognized as the winner of last year's presidential election, kicked off a tour of Latin America on Saturday, just days before President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is set to be sworn in for a third term in defiance of international pressure.",
      "A crowd of a few hundred Venezuelan migrants broke into shouts of \u201cEdmundo, Presidente\u201d as Gonz\u00e1lez emerged from a meeting with Argentine President Javier Milei to wave to supporters from the balcony of the iconic Casa Rosada, or Pink House, in Buenos Aires.",
      "\u201cWe are doing whatever the cause of freedom requires,\u201d Milei, an effusive far-right supporter of the Venezuelan opposition, said as he welcomed Gonz\u00e1lez to the presidential palace with honors normally reserved for a head of state.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a retired diplomat, fled into exile in Spain in September after a judge issued an arrest warrant following the July 28 presidential election, in which Maduro was declared the winner by the National Electoral Council, which is stacked with governing party loyalists.",
      "In recent weeks, he has been vowing to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, which according to law must begin on Jan. 10. But he hasn't said how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military.",
      "On Thursday, Maduro\u2019s government raised the stakes even further, announcing a $100,000 reward for information on Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s whereabouts and plastering the wanted-like bulletin with the retired diplomat's photo on social media and the arrivals board at the country's main airport.",
      "Upon arrival to the Argentine capital, where he twice served as Venezuela\u2019s ambassador more than two decades ago, Gonz\u00e1lez posted on social media a short video message expressing solidarity with those imprisoned in Venezuela as part of a crackdown by Maduro.",
      "He said that he would raise with Milei concerns about the well-being of five Maduro opponents who have been sheltering in the Argentine ambassador\u2019s residence in Caracas for nearly 10 months \u2014 a diplomatic standoff that has embittered relations between Venezuela and Argentina.",
      "The Biden administration and most European governments have rejected the election's official results, pointing out that authorities didn't provide detailed results as they have in past elections. Meanwhile, copies of tally sheets collected by the opposition from 85% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines show that Gonz\u00e1lez prevailed by a more than two-to-one margin.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 75, was a previously unknown career diplomat when he was thrust into rallying the anti-Maduro coalition as a last-minute stand-in for opposition stalwart Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, whom the government banned from running for office.",
      "After speaking with Milei on Saturday, Gonz\u00e1lez is scheduled to cross the Rio de la Plata for a meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou."

      "Nick Khan\u2019s prediction becomes a reality on Monday night",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Nick Khan's prediction becomes a reality on Monday night.",
      "The World Wrestling Entertainment executive said during earning calls in the past that he saw a day when Netflix would continue to evolve and enter into live programming, much to the consternation of Netflix officials.",
      "However, Khan saw the hires that Netflix was making along with the streaming service's offerings that could appeal to all family members.",
      "Now, one of those offerings is the WWE.",
      "The 1,650th episode of \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d from the Intuit Dome outside of Los Angeles officially kicks off WWE's 10-year partnership with Netflix. The agreement, reached last January, is worth in excess of $5 billion with an option for Netflix to extend for an additional 10 years or opt out after five.",
      "\u201cWe try to appeal the WWE to all 50 states and to countries globally. We think Netflix does the same thing,\" said Khan, who is WWE\u2019s president.",
      "Netflix \u2014 which has 282.3 million subscribers in more than 190 countries \u2014 becomes the exclusive home of \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America, with additional countries to be added over time. The bigger component for Netflix though, is that the streaming platform will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas \u2014 including \u201cSmackdown\u201d and \u201cNXT\u201d \u2014 as well as premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "In the U.S., \u201cSmackdown\u201d moved to USA Network from Fox and \u201cNXT\u201d from USA to the CW three months ago. Peacock has a contract to carry WWE's premium live events through March 2026.",
      "\u201cRaw\u201d began airing on Jan. 11, 1993, and is the longest running weekly episodic series on television. Most of that time had been on USA Network with a run on Spike TV, now known as Paramount Network.",
      "\u201cIt has great storytelling, characters along with memorable and surprising stories. And the idea of combining this kind of intense fandom with these characters and our reach globally just seemed like such a great opportunity,\u201d said Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. \u201cWhat we also love is the multigenerational fan base. At the end of the day, we have great things that our members love and this totally delivers on all of the things that we want. And to do it 52 weeks a year is super exciting.\"",
      "WWE's global reach has expanded during the past year, with nearly half of its premium live events taking place overseas. The company will also embark on an extended tour of Europe in March to build momentum for WrestleMania 41, which takes place in Las Vegas April 19 and 20.",
      "Khan said WWE first approached Netflix about its rights in 2018, but Netflix wasn't ready to begin carrying live events. The streaming service has ramped up its efforts during the past year, not only with sports events, but with Chris Rock's comedy special and the roast of Tom Brady.",
      "Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the social media buzz around \u201cRaw\u201d each week as well as the stable audience WWE provides made it a natural fit this time when the company approached Netflix last year.",
      "In turn, Riegg thinks Netflix can help expand WWE's audience the way it did with Formula 1 and the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d series.",
      "\u201cIt really was just fitting in to the whole picture of we\u2019re going to do these big events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the NFL on Christmas,\" he said. \"But then throughout the year, if we can have a steady drumbeat of those amazing live moments and live action and spectacle, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get with WWE.\u201d",
      "According to Nielsen, \u201cRaw's\u201d final episode on USA Network averaged 1.6 million viewers despite going against the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Khan and WWE chief content officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque have also stressed that the three-hour weekly show will not hurt its rating due to being on a streaming platform. \u201cRaw\u201d was known for toeing the line on risky content during the late 1990s in what WWE called the \u201cAttitude Era,\u201d but that has changed over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not pushing anybody away of what they want. It\u2019s a safe place for families and everybody to be able to view. That will not change, but you don\u2019t have to change that to expand and improve what you do,\u201d Levesque said.",
      "WWE's storytelling and character development continues to excel even during external challenges. Former chairman Vince McMahon resigned last January after a lawsuit claiming sexual misconduct. In 2023, WWE was bought by Endeavor and merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship to create TKO Group Holdings.",
      "According to WWE, there were 44 sellouts for TV shows and 66 overall, including house shows and premium live events, in 2024.",
      "WWE champion Cody Rhodes credited Khan and Levesque for keeping the company on track, along with scaling back on some of the non-televised live events to make sure top talent does not get burned out during the year.",
      "Levesque said Monday's show will be on the level of a premium live event. John Cena, who is retiring from WWE at the end of the year, begins his farewell tour with three main event matches on tap. It also wouldn't be a shock if Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson makes an appearance.",
      "Roman Reigns, who will take part in one of the main event matches, said he is always trying to put his best foot forward, but he also knows how big Monday night is for the company.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding that this is Netflix and this is huge and this is going to be on a global platform with a lot of people watching. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that audience is going to look like. It\u2019s going to be crazy, I know that.\"",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and an oil industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused by climate change",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.",
      "The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.",
      "The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating \u201cagainst the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.\u201d",
      "The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure \u201caccurately and fairly\u201d the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.",
      "\u201cVermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,\" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber\u2019s litigation center. \u201cThat is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 one state can\u2019t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont\u2019s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.",
      "Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of \u201ctrying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore states are following Vermont\u2019s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,\" Iarrapino added.",
      "Under the law, the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, is to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to Vermonters and the state from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The assessment would look at the effects on public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas. The state would use federal data to determine the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a fossil fuel company.",
      "It\u2019s a polluter-pays model affecting companies engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil attributable to more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the time period. The funds could be used by the state for such things as improving stormwater drainage systems; upgrading roads, bridges and railroads; relocating, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants; and making energy efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings. It\u2019s modeled after the federal Superfund pollution cleanup program.",
      "The approach taken by Vermont has drawn interest from other states, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a similar bill in December.",
      "The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects meant to repair or avoid future damage from climate change. The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would be subjected to the fines."

      "NEW YORK -- A Major League Baseball panel cut the rights fees owed the Washington Nationals from the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network by 20% for each of the final three seasons of the five-year period through 2026, citing a deteriorating cable television market.",
      "MLB\u2019s Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee awarded the team approximately $320.5 million from the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 controlled MASN for 2022-26 in a decision issued Monday. The rights fee was set at about $72.8 million each for 2022 and \u201923 \u2014 matching 2021 \u2014 and dropped to approximately $58.3 million annually from 2024-26.",
      "The committee of Milwaukee Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio, Colorado Rockies chairman Richard Montfort and Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner attributed the decision to an expected drop in revenue due to subscriber loss and an inability to increase per-subscriber fees.",
      "\u201cIt was foreseeable that, to minimize the risk of bankruptcy, MASN would have sought, and the Nationals would have agreed to, a reduction in rights fees for 2024-2026; and a 20% cut in rights fees is consistent with what the market expected in 2021,\u201d the RSDC wrote in a 56-page decision.",
      "Average rights fees due the Nationals were valued at about $64.1 million for 2022-26, down from $69.9 million for 2017-21 before a pandemic adjustment to $60.8 million and up from $59.4 million for 2012-16.",
      "\u201cThe parties agree that industry conditions were deteriorating, and that MASN would continue to experience subscriber declines in the 2022-2026 period (though they disagree as to the rate of such losses ...),\u201d the panel wrote in a decision that redacted many of the the figures each team argued for.",
      "This marked the third straight five-year period the teams took their dispute to the RSDC. The decision became public when the Nationals filed a petition asking for the New York Supreme Court to confirm the award. The filing of the petition was first reported by The Sun in Baltimore.",
      "Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer representing the Orioles, and Patrick Curran, a lawyer representing the Nationals, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Litigation over 2012-16 rights fees resulted in a 2019 RSDC decision by Attanasio, Seattle Mariners president Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro valuing them at $296.8 million. After arguments that went to the New York Court of Appeals, the sides agreed to a settlement in June 2023.",
      "A RSDC decision on Nov. 8, 2023, by Attanasio, Montfort and Werner said Washington was owed about $304.1 million by MASN for 2017-21, after an adjustment downward of almost $45.5 million for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. That decision was confirmed by New York Supreme Court Justice Andrew Borrok the following month.",
      "MASN was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore\u2019s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972.",
      "The Orioles were given a supermajority partnership interest in MASN, starting at 90%, and Washington made a $75 million payment to the network for an initial 10% stake.",
      "The agreement between the clubs set network\u2019s rights payments to each team at $20 million apiece in 2005 and 2006, rising to $25 million in 2007, with $1 million annual increases through 2011. The deal called for the Nationals\u2019 equity to increase 1% annually, starting after the 2009 season, with a cap of 33%.",

      "The Transportation Department said Friday it will hit JetBlue Airways with a $2 million penalty for chronically late flights along the East Coast, and half the money will go to passengers who were delayed.",
      "The agency said it\u2019s the first time it has fined an airline for chronic delays on specific routes, which it blamed on \u201cunrealistic scheduling\u201d by JetBlue.",
      "\u201cIllegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today\u2019s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. His department has led the Biden administration in criticizing airlines for poor service and an increase in fees on travelers.",
      "JetBlue said the government, which operates the air traffic control system, shares the blame for late flights.",
      "Airline spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said JetBlue has invested \u201ctens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays, particularly related to ongoing air traffic control challenges in our largest markets in the Northeast and Florida,\u201d resulting in better on-time performance in 2024, including during the peak summer travel season.",
      "\u201cWhile we\u2019ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation\u2019s air traffic control system,\u201d Dombrowski said. He said the incoming Trump administration should prioritize modernizing \u201coutdated\u201d air traffic control technology and understaffing of controllers, who are hired by the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Transportation Department regulations prohibit airlines from publishing schedules that don\u2019t reflect real departure and arrival times. The agency defines a flight as chronically delayed if it runs at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than half the time.",
      "The department cited JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. It said it warned JetBlue about frequent delays on flights between New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Frequent delays also occurred on flights between JFK and Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida, and between Windsor Locks, Connecticut and Fort Lauderdale.",

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has already taken several actions to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene",
      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe needs facing this region are vast and require immediate attention,\u201d Stein said at a news conference. \u201cI pledge to do everything in my power as governor to accelerate recovery of the rebuilding of a more resilient region for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",
      "More than 12,000 western North Carolinians are displaced from their homes due to Helene, which also caused significant damage to more than 8,000 private roads and bridges, Stein's orders said.",
      "\u201cWhen I have met with affected folks here in the mountains, the need for housing assistance and the repairing of private bridges and roads has come up in nearly every conversation,\" he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina \u2014 I want you to know that I hear you.\u201d",
      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

      "The Titans introduced Carthon as the franchise's first Black general manager and its 14th of all time in January 2023, and he helped the franchise hire a new coach in Brian Callahan a year later.",
      "Tennessee controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk, who fired general manager Jon Robinson in December 2022, will have yet another new GM helping the franchise decide what to do with its fourth overall No. 1 pick in the NFL draft after going 3-14 in 2024. Strunk said Chad Brinker, president of football operations, will lead the search for a new GM.",
      "Strunk said in a statement that it was impossible to ignore that the Titans didn't improve over the last two years. She said Callahan would continue as head coach.",
      "The Titans lost their final six games and eight of nine. The 14 losses matched the 2014 season for the most losses since the team relocated from Texas to Tennessee in 1997. It has had the No. 1 overall pick once since then, and Robinson traded it for a haul of selections for his first NFL draft in 2016.",

      "While 14 teams are deep into playoff preparations with hopes of winning a Super Bowl, there are five teams that had disappointing campaigns that have led to coaching changes.",
      "The search to fill those spots has already begun with the New York Jets, Chicago, New Orleans, Jacksonville and New England already identifying candidates to interview, including several who are on the staffs of the playoff teams.",
      "The NFL has strict rules on when \u2014 and how long \u2014 those coaches can talk to other teams while their seasons are still alive. Here's a look at some of the protocols in place for the coaching searches.",

      "In-person interviews with assistants who are under contract with other teams can begin on Jan. 20, unless those teams are still alive for the conference title games.",
      "Those coaches must wait until Jan. 27, when either they were eliminated from the playoffs or have a bye week before the Super Bowl. Coaches on the Super Bowl teams are allowed to be interviewed through Feb. 2 but are forbidden from talking to other teams after that until Feb. 10, the day after the Super Bowl.",
      "Coaches on the Super Bowl teams are not allowed to interview in person with other teams during the bye week if they hadn't done an initial virtual interview earlier in January.",
      "No coach can either sign a contract or agree to sign a contract until their season is completed.",
      "Teams must abide by the Rooney Rule, which was first implemented in 2003 to boost minority hiring. Before hiring a new head coach, teams are required to conduct in-person interviews with at least two diverse \u2014 minority or female \u2014 candidates who don't currently work for the team.",
      "The rules are the same for all coordinator positions and clubs must interview one diverse candidate for any quarterback coach job.",

      "The rules are a little different for interviewing candidates for general manager. Teams could start seeking permission on Monday to interview candidates from other organizations who weren't the primary decision maker.",
      "Teams must conduct in-person interviews of at least two minority or women candidates from outside the organization to satisfy the Rooney Rule.",

      "In a petition filed in Travis County Probate Court in Austin, Texas, Sheel Seidler sued Matthew, who became executor of Peter Seidler's estate last year, and Robert, the prior executor. She claimed fiduciary breaches of trust, fraud, conversion and egregious acts of self-dealing.",

      "\u201cI made this decision as a very last resort, but I am confident it is the right one and the best way to protect the Padres franchise and ensure the vision that Peter and I shared for the team will continue,\u201d Sheel said in a statement.",
      "The Peter Seidler Trust issued a statement calling the suit \u201centirely without merit.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeter had a clear estate plan,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe plan specifically named three of his nine siblings, with whom he had worked closely for many decades, as successor trustees of his trust and Peter himself prohibited Sheel from ever serving as trustee.\u201d",
      "Peter Seidler, a grandson of late Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, was an investor in the group that took over the Padres in 2012. He replaced Ron Fowler as the team's control person on Nov. 18, 2020, and died at age 63 on Nov. 14, 2023. Three days later, the team appointed Eric Kutsenda, a Peter Seidler business partner, as interim control person.",

      "\u201cThe emphasis in the press reports on the Padres cutting salary, lowering their expectations, and implicitly abandoning their all-out pursuit of a World Series championship would have been a gut-punch to Peter,\u201d the petition said.",
      "The petition included a piece of paper purported to be in Peter Seidler's handwriting listing Sheel followed by their children as his preference for future control person. The petition quotes Matthew as telling Sheel in a letter last Oct. 15 that she lacks \u201cthe experience, skills and financial acumen necessary to fulfill the responsibilities of this important role.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than appoint Sheel as Padres control person \u2014 consistent with Peter\u2019s noted preference and as the person whose interests are best aligned with the Seidler trusts \u2014 defendants are attempting to force the appointment of their brother John as the Padres control person,\" the petition alleged.",
      "\u201cBy doing so, they are placing control of the Padres and the Seidler trusts\u2019 substantial interests in the hands of a third party and enjoying the appearance and benefits of being principal owners. Meanwhile, defendants have frozen Sheel out of the Padres organization and deprived her of the benefits of being the largest beneficial owner of the baseball team, while themselves enjoying those benefits.\u201d",

      "She accused Matthew and Robert of attempting to sell the trusts' interests in Seidler Kutsenda Management Co. at below market value and then rescinding the sale when the attempt became known.",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- After some uncertainty, the Tampa Bay Rays now support a $55.7 million city plan to repair hurricane-shredded Tropicana Field in time for the 2026 season opener, while the team prepares to play this year at the New York Yankees' spring training home in nearby Tampa.",
      "Matt Silverman, the Rays' co-president, said in an email to the St. Petersburg chief administrator that the team wants to \u201cclear up\u201d any questions about its support for the reconstruction. The city must pay for the work under its current contract with the Rays.",
      "\u201cWhile we had been open to considering a scenario in which the city bought out of its obligation to rebuild the ballpark, the Rays support and expect the city to rebuild Tropicana Field in accordance with the terms of the current use agreement,\u201d Silverman wrote.",
      "Hurricane Milton tore the Trop's fabric roof to pieces when it came ashore Oct. 9, causing water and other damage to interior parts of the now-exposed ballpark. Work has been ongoing to ensure no further damage is caused by weather but there had been questions about the full repair in part because it would eventually be torn down to make way for a new, $1.3 billion ballpark under current plans to keep the Rays in St. Petersburg another 30 years.",
      "Time is of the essence, Silverman said in his Dec. 30 email to the city, which released it Monday. Even a partial 2026 season at Tropicana Field \u201cwould present massive logistical and revenue challenges for the team,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt is therefore critical that the rebuild start in earnest as soon as possible\" with a realistic construction schedule to be ready by opening day 2026, he added.",
      "The city had no immediate comment on the email. Its own architect presented the repair proposal initially on Dec. 12 but it has not yet been fully approved. Members of the city council have balked at the cost, especially with residents and businesses still recovering from Milton and Hurricane Helene before that.",
      "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch has said that insurance and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds should cover the bulk of the cost. Silverman said Major League Baseball has told the team it will hire its own advisor to monitor the repair work and timeline.",
      "The planned new downtown Rays ballpark is part of a $6.5 billion project that will include affordable housing, a Black history museum, retail and office space, restaurants and bars. The project is known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which was once a thriving Black community displaced by the construction of the ballpark and an interstate highway.",
      "The Rays are preparing to play 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' 11,000-seat spring training location in Tampa. Once Tropicana Field is repaired, Silverman acknowledged the Rays are obligated to play there three more seasons under the contract with St. Petersburg.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to a grand reopening,\u201d Silverman said.",

      "Novak Djokovic said he still feels \u201ca bit of trauma\u201d when he travels to Australia, stemming from his deportation in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of times that I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration, I had a bit of trauma from three years ago,\" Djokovic said in an interview with Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper published Monday, ahead of the Australian Open. \u201cAnd some traces still stay there when I\u2019m passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is approaching.\u201d",
      "Djokovic, who has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam championships at Melbourne Park, continued: \u201cThe person checking my passport \u2014 are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go? I must admit I have that feeling.\u201d",
      "Back in 2022, Djokovic sought, and initially obtained, an exemption that would allow him into the Australian Open \u2014 and the country \u2014 even though there were strict rules requiring shots to protect against the coronavirus. But after his flight landed, he was detained at the airport, his visa was canceled and he was sent to an immigration hotel.",
      "A judge later reinstated the visa and ordered Djokovic\u2019s release, ruling he wasn\u2019t given enough time to speak to his lawyers. Australia\u2019s immigration minister then took away the visa again, based on \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Djokovic\u2019s appeal of that ruling was denied by a three-judge panel, and he was deported. He faced a possible three-year ban from the country as someone whose visa was revoked, but Australia had a change of government, its pandemic border rules changed and a new immigration minister granted Djokovic a visa in 2023 \u2014 when he went on to claim the trophy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hold any resentment, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic told the Herald Sun about the saga. \u201cI don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d",

      "\u201cI just hope to, before I retire, get at least one more title there,\" said the 37-year-old Djokovic, whose only triumph at a tournament in 2024 was his singles gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympics in August.",
      "Djokovic opened 2025 at the Brisbane International last week, losing in the quarterfinals to Reilly Opelka.",
      "At the Australian Open, Djokovic will be playing in his first event alongside new coach Andy Murray, his former on-court rival and a three-time major champion who retired as a player after the Summer Games.

      "Khan fired Pederson on Monday, a day after a 26-23 overtime loss at Indianapolis. It was the team\u2019s 18th loss in its last 23 games. More surprising, he kept Baalke.",
      "Khan made the move with one year remaining on Pederson\u2019s contract and more than five months after the owner stood in front of coaches and players and declared this the \u201cbest team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever.\"",
      "\u201cWinning now\u201d was Khan\u2019s edict as training camp opened and after he committed nearly half a billion dollars to signing quarterback Trevor Lawrence, pass rusher Josh Hines-Allen and cornerback Tyson Campbell to long-term deals in the offseason. It was the most expensive stretch of roster building in franchise history.",
      "And Khan has gotten little return on his investment.",
      "\u201cAs much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better, I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans, who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded,\u201d Khan said in a statement. \"In that spirit, the time to summon new leadership is now.",
      "\u201cI strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago.\"",
      "Pederson, who led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl title in 2018, finished 9-8 in his first two campaigns in Jacksonville and made the playoffs in his first year. He became the first coach in franchise history to start with back-to-back winning seasons and was a welcome relief following Urban Meyer\u2019s 13-game tenure that was filled with dysfunction.",
      "But Pederson\u2019s injury-riddled team went 1-5 down the stretch in 2023 and missed the postseason after spending nearly two months atop the AFC South. He thought getting Lawrence healthy and revamping his defensive staff would change the team\u2019s fortunes. Neither made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt's unfortunate because at the end of the day we all had a hand in it,\u201d receiver Christian Kirk said. \u201cI have a ton of respect for Doug. He\u2019s made me a better football player, better man. I think he\u2019s one of the better coaches to have coached in this league, and it\u2019s just unfortunate the way that things went.\u201d",
      "More damning: Pederson failed to develop Lawrence or create a team identity, handed play-calling duties to Press Taylor despite Khan making his wishes known and showed no urgency to try to fix a defense that regressed under new coordinator Ryan Nielsen.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that have gone into our season,\u201d tight end Evan Engram said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the coaching. It's not just one part of it. It's everybody. I\u2019ve been in this league for a while. I try not to get into the whole that side of it, so definitely it\u2019s always unfortunate when most changes do come.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars (4-13) finished with their 10th losing season in Khan\u2019s 13 years as owner. Now, Khan will hire his sixth head coach; current NFL offensive coordinators Ben Johnson (Detroit) and Liam Coen (Tampa Bay) should top the list. But would they even agree to work with Baalke, whose draft picks have been mostly suspect and his latest free-agent class is among the worst in franchise history?",
      "The 56-year-old Pederson went 23-30 with Jacksonville, a far cry from the Super Bowl-winning coach Khan thought he hired in February 2021.",
      "His tenure with Jacksonville was mostly forgettable. Sure, there was the come-from-behind stunner over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC wild-card round in January 2023 in which Lawrence rallied the Jaguars from a 27-0 deficit and won 31-30. Otherwise, Pederson was fairly pedestrian.",
      "His ultimate undoing came in close games, with Jacksonville going 3-10 in one-score contests this season. Whether that\u2019s talent or coaching is debatable. Regardless, Pederson got little public support from players down the stretch, a clear sign that the locker room was ready for a different direction.",
      "Now Khan has to find the right coach to get Lawrence \u2014 and the rest of the team \u2014 to another level. It also will have to be someone amenable to working with Baalke, whose coaching list includes Jim Harbaugh (2011-14), Jim Tomsula (2015), Chip Kelly (2022), Meyer (2021) and Pederson (2022-24).",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 12:26:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months",
    "story": [
      "Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months",
      "MIAMI -- Pat Riley turns 80 in a couple of months. The Miami Heat president has not revealed any retirement timetable. He still wears impeccable suits, shakes hands with as firm of a grip as anyone, knows all eyes are on him when he walks into just about any room.",
      "He's not stopping. Or changing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a rock. And that\u2019s why he\u2019s the Godfather,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last month. \"That\u2019s why we all kill ourselves for this culture. It's because of him. We believe in him.\u201d",
      "And, as some have learned over the years, clashing with Riley doesn't always end well.",
      "Jimmy Butler's in-progress breakup with the Heat \u2014 Miami didn't give him an extension, Butler wants a trade, the franchise suspended him for seven games for conduct detrimental to the team, and here we are \u2014 is not the first time that a superstar has been in Miami but had his time with Riley's team come to an unceremonious end.",
      "Dwyane Wade left (but returned). LeBron James left. Shaquille O'Neal got traded. All of those situations \u2014 and Butler's, as well \u2014 are different in plenty of ways. But the parallel in them in that Riley will only do what he thinks is best for the Heat.",
      "\u201cI know from personal experience,\u201d O\u2019Neal said in his role as an analyst on TNT last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t bicker with Pat Riley.\u201d",
      "A look at those situations:",
      "How they got here: Butler was eligible for a $113 million, two-year extension last summer. The Heat didn't offer it, so this dispute is largely about money.",
      "There's more to it, of course.",
      "Butler is not an easy guy to deal with, which is not a knock on him nor is it a bad thing. He's headstrong, driven, says what he thinks, doesn't really care what you think, does the work and plays to win. It was a perfect fit for the Heat, who like to say that they're not for everybody. Neither is Butler.",
      "Riley made two comments last spring that Butler surely didn't like: that he \u2014 and all of Miami's best-paid players \u2014 need to play more often, and that Butler shouldn't have talked about beating teams still in the playoffs when the Heat were not. (Butler made a comment about how if he wasn't hurt the Heat would have beaten Boston and New York in the postseason; Riley didn't like that he said that.)",
      "Butler has said for years that he only wants to be wanted. Evidently, he did not feel wanted in Miami any longer.",
      "There were a lot of factors in this story. Money was not the only issue, but it was among them.",
      "Wade thought about leaving in the summer of 2015 before he and the team agreed on a one-year, $20 million contract. A year later, the Heat offered Wade every dollar they had available \u2014 about $42 million for two years. Chicago offered about $47 million. And that was that.",
      "Chicago is Wade's hometown. Ironically, Butler was on that Bulls team that Wade was joining; Wade played a big role in convincing Butler to go to Miami in 2019. Eventually, whatever hard feelings existed between Wade and Heat went away; he finished his career in Miami and the team rewarded him with a statue earlier this season.",
      "Riley was contrite when Wade left.",
      "\u201cThat is where we both failed ... I more than he, because he\u2019s the asset, he\u2019s the star, he\u2019s the face of the franchise,\u201d Riley said at that time. \u201cI should have done everything that I could have verbally in trying to change his mindset to mine, a big picture, a better picture, or one that I thought would help him.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Wade's longtime agent, Henry Thomas, died. Riley was part of the Heat contingent that went to the funeral. He and Wade hugged. A couple weeks later, Miami swung a deal with Cleveland \u2014 Wade had moved on from Chicago \u2014 to bring the franchise's all-time scoring leader back to Miami.",
      "\u201cIt ended the way it was supposed to end,\u201d Wade said in his final days as a Heat player.",
      "O'Neal was traded to Miami in 2004. Two years later, the Heat won a title. Two years after that, they were broken down, Wade was hurt, and the team was headed to the bottom of the NBA.",
      "O'Neal didn't want to be in Miami anymore. He got traded to Phoenix. Initially, the breakup was not exactly amicable; over time, wounds were healed on both sides. O'Neal's number hangs from the rafters and he's welcomed back like a long-lost hero every time he's in Miami for a game.",
      "\u201cIt was not personal,\u201d Riley said when the team retired O'Neal's jersey in 2016. \u201cShaq was impeccable with his word. He came down here and said \u2018We\u2019re gonna win a title, Coach.\u2019 And we won a title. ... No hard feelings, at all. I\u2019m an Irishman and I forgive.\u201d",
      "There are a ton of theories about why James left the Heat after four years, four runs to the NBA Finals and two championships in Miami.",
      "Was everything perfect? No. But when the Heat lost the 2014 finals to San Antonio, ending their two-year reign as NBA champions, James was on the verge of free agency. It was widely believed that he would strongly consider leaving.",
      "\u201cYou've got to stay together \u2014 if you've got the guts \u2014 and you don't find the first door and run out of it,\u201d Riley said in a now-infamous speech a few days after that season ended.",
      "A couple weeks later, James made it official: He was going back to Cleveland.",
      "\u201cWhen I became a free agent in 2010, I felt what was best for me was to go to Miami,\u201d James would say in that first season back in Cleveland. \u201cAnd when I became a free agent once again this past summer, I thought what was best was going back home.\u201d",
      "And James' Heat fans are still fans. James got a huge ovation when he returned to Miami for the first time as an opponent \u2014 and still does a decade later. Riley announced years ago that James' number will also be retired by the Heat.",

      "BALTIMORE -- Baltimore's division-clinching victory over Cleveland was about as routine as expected.",
      "Except for one second-quarter play that could be a major problem for the Ravens' dynamic offense.",
      "Zay Flowers, the team's top receiver, went down with a knee injury and didn't return to the game Saturday. Coach John Harbaugh sounded somewhat optimistic afterward but said there would be an MRI.",
      "Baltimore finished the regular season 12-5 despite dropping its first two games. It's just one game worse than the record that gave the Ravens the league's best mark in 2023, but this time there will be no first-round bye. Baltimore will be the No. 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.",
      "So Flowers doesn't have much time to recover. The Pro Bowl receiver caught 74 passes for 1,059 yards and four touchdowns in the regular season.",
      "Baltimore trailed Pittsburgh by two games in the AFC North with four to play. Then the Ravens went 4-0 and the Steelers went 0-4 the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a week-to-week league, and you really just have to take it one week at a time, one day at a time, one play at time, and our guys have done a really good job of holding onto that,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThat 1-0 T-shirt that we all wear around is real, and so, four wins later, we\u2019re the AFC North champions.\u201d",
      "You wouldn't think there'd be enough plays or enough footballs or enough yards on the field for both Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry to put up these numbers, but here are the final totals for the regular season. For Jackson: 4,172 yards passing and 915 rushing. For Henry: 1,921 yards rushing.",
      "The Ravens became the first team in NFL history with 4,000 yards passing and 3,000 rushing in one season. Obviously, the regular season is a bit longer now than it used to be \u2014 but Jackson and Henry both seem to have made each other better, and they've taken the offense to another level.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve won four in a row. I feel like everybody\u2019s been doing a great job of doing their jobs so we can execute on offense, and it\u2019s been fun,\" Henry said. \"We\u2019ve got to keep it going, stay locked in (and) hold each other accountable so we keep that same momentum in the playoffs.\u201d",
      "The wide receiver group could be thin if Flowers is limited. Rashod Bateman had a good game against Cleveland, and so did the tight end tandem of Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, but receiver Tylan Wallace played 51 offensive snaps and finished with one target and no catches.",
      "Michael Pierce's first career interception was a late highlight in this game, and it also underscored how healthy he looks after four games back from an injured reserve stint.",
      "Pierce, listed at 355 pounds, had some running room on his interception but was about 80 yards from the end zone and gave himself up with a slide.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of turning big-guy interceptions and fumbles into memes, so at the risk of turning myself into one of those, I decided it was just time to go home,\u201d he said. \"Plus, I was out of gas, so it was good.\u201d",
      "Defensive back Brandon Stephens was targeted with some success by the Browns, and he can expect similar treatment in the playoffs after all the big defensive plays teammates Marlon Humphrey and Nate Wiggins have made.",
      "Bateman and safety Kyle Hamilton were both shaken up but returned to the field, so Flowers is the lone significant injury concern coming out of the game for the Ravens.",
      "Baltimore's last two games of the regular season were its best in terms of total yards allowed. The Ravens allowed just 211 in a 31-2 win at Houston, then 230 against the Browns.",
      "Baltimore's first-round playoff opponent depended on the result of the Chargers-Raiders game Sunday. The Ravens will host either the Chargers or the Steelers.",

      "But Maher, \u201c the most followed rugby player on the planet,\u201d could not prevent Bristol from losing 40-17 to defending champion Gloucester-Hartpury in a Premiership Women\u2019s Rugby match.",
      "She came on as a substitute in the 61st minute at Ashton Gate with Bristol trailing 28-10. Maher made her presence felt in a couple of rucks and looked for work off the wing but could make little impact to the overall picture in her 20 minutes on the field.",
      "The previous attendance record for a Bristol women\u2019s home match was 4,101 against Harlequins in May 2022. Such was the anticipation surrounding Maher's debut that Bristol relocated the match from a smaller venue to Ashton Gate to satisfy demand for seats.",
      "The 28-year-old Maher, who helped lead the U.S. to the bronze medal in rugby sevens at the Paris Games, has signed a three-month contract with Bristol in southwestern England. She had begun training with Bristol in December when the team announced the signing before going back to the United States for the holidays.",
      "Maher has more than 8 million followers combined on Instagram and TikTok. She was a runner-up on the \u201cDancing With The Stars\" TV show.",

League-leading Harlequins said they set a women\u2019s club rugby record for attendance on Dec. 28 when 18,055 fans watched the team beat Leicester Tigers 42-17 at Twickenham Stadium. That was not a stand-alone match; it was part of a doubleheader with the Harlequins men\u2019s team.",

      "Chipmaker Nvidia has unveiled new technology for gamers and creators at CES 2025",
      "LAS VEGAS -- In a packed Las Vegas arena, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang stood on stage and marveled over the crisp real-time computer graphics displayed on the screen behind him. He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "The chipmaker and AI darling unveiled its GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs \u2014 its most advanced consumer graphics processor units for gamers, creators and developers. The tech is designed for use on both desktop and laptop computers.",
      "Ahead of Huang's speech, Nvidia stock climbed 3.4% to top its record set in November. Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing even as criticism rises that their stock prices have already shot too high, too fast. Despite worries about a potential bubble, the industry continues to talk up its potential.",
      "Huang said the GPUs, which use the company\u2019s next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell, can deliver breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering.",
      "\u201cBlackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,\u201d Huang said, adding that Blackwell \u201cis the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.\u201d Blackwell technology is now in full production, he said.",
      "Building on the tech Nvidia released 25 years ago, the company announced that it would also introduce \u201cRTX Neural Shaders,\u201d which use AI to help render game characters in deep detail \u2013 a task that's notoriously tricky because people can easily spot a small error on digital humans.",
      "Huang said Nvidia is also introducing a new suite of technologies that enable \u201cautonomous characters\u201d to perceive, plan and act like human players. Those characters can help players plan strategies or adapt tactics to challenge players and create more dynamic battles.",
      "In addition to Nvidia, tech giants such as AMD, Google and Samsung are at CES 2025 to unveil artificial intelligence tools aimed at helping both content creators and consumers alike in their quest for entertainment.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:56:34 -0500",
    "summary": "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition and other plaintiffs sued, winning a preliminary injunction that blocks the attorney general from enforcement while court proceedings continue. However, the coalition expressed concern that private lawsuits or actions by individual district attorneys could be possible.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Lipman wrote that parental controls on minors' devices are more effective and less restrictive.",
      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "Data collected by Tesla on the driver and vehicle in the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion and then shared with law enforcement has shined a spotlight on a difficult ethical question for the auto industry: Are companies violating your privacy rights",
      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",
      "\u201cI think law enforcement should have access to data that can help them solve things quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have a right to privacy.\u201d"

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "summary": "Tesla&rsquo;s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
    "story": [
      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

      "\"This is a highly dangerous windstorm that\u2019s creating extreme fire risk \u2013 and we're not out of the woods,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. \"We\u2019re already seeing the destructive impacts with this fire in Pacific Palisades that grew rapidly in a matter of minutes.\"",
      "The Eaton Fire -- a separate breakout a breakout to the northeast of Pacific Palisades -- seemed to exemplify those remarks. Fueled by the whipping winds, the Altadena-based brush fire rapidly grew from 10 acres to 200 acres in just 30 minutes on Tuesday evening.",
      "President Joe Biden received two briefings regarding the rapidly spreading fire, the White House said in a statement, and he encouraged residents to heed evacuation orders.",

      "\"Fortunately, Getty had made extensive efforts to clear brush from the surrounding area as part of its fire mitigation efforts throughout the year,\" Katherine E. Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust said in a statement. \"Some trees and vegetation on site have burned, but staff and the collection remain safe.\"",
      "The museum said its galleries and library archives were sealed off from smoke by its state-of-the-art air-handling system and the doubled-walled construction of its galleries.",
      "Wind conditions were expected to worsen into the evening and through the night, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone.",

    "story": [
      "Culture",
      "Culture",
      "Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni in late December.",
      "Blake Lively's lawyers have issued a statement amid the ongoing legal feud between her and Justin Baldoni.",
      "In the new statement, released Jan. 7, Lively's lawyers said, \"Ms. Lively's federal litigation before the Southern District of New York involves serious claims of sexual harassment and retaliation, backed by concrete facts. This is not a 'feud' arising from 'creative differences' or a 'he said/she said' situation. As alleged in Ms. Lively's complaint, and as we will prove in litigation, Wayfarer and its associates engaged in unlawful, retaliatory astroturfing against Ms. Lively for simply trying to protect herself and others on a film set.\"",
      "The statement, issued on Lively's behalf, also claimed that Baldoni's response -- his lawsuit filed Dec. 31 against The New York Times -- was allegedly meant to \"launch more attacks against Ms. Lively since her filing.\"",
      "The statement continued, \"While we go through the legal process, we urge everyone to remember that sexual harassment and retaliation are illegal in every workplace and in every industry. A classic tactic to distract from allegations of this type of misconduct is to 'blame the victim' by suggesting that they invited the conduct, brought it on themselves, misunderstood the intentions, or even lied. Another classic tactic is to reverse the victim and offender, and suggest that the offender is actually the victim.\"",
      "\"These concepts normalize and trivialize allegations of serious misconduct,\" the statement concluded. \"Most importantly, media statements are not a defense to Ms. Lively's legal claims. We will continue to prosecute her claims in federal court, where the rule of law determines who prevails, not hyperbole and threats.\"",
      "The statement from Lively's camp comes after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel and false light invasion of privacy for publishing a story detailing Lively's initial claims against him, including sexual harassment and orchestrating a smear campaign against Lively during the production of the film \"It Ends with Us,\" which Baldoni also directed and starred in with Lively. The lawsuit came after Lively's initial complaint, filed Dec. 20, and subsequent lawsuit, filed Dec. 31, against Baldoni.",
      "In a statement to \"Good Morning America\" addressing Lively's latest comments, Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, said, \"It is painfully ironic that Blake Lively is accusing Justin Baldoni of weaponizing the media when her own team orchestrated this vicious attack by sending the New York Times grossly edited documents prior to even filing the complaint. We are releasing all of the evidence which will show a pattern of bullying and threats to take over the movie. None of this will come as a surprise because consistent with her past behavior Blake Lively used other people to communicate those threats and bully her way to get whatever she wanted. We have all the receipts and more.\"",
      "Read more about the legal battle between Lively and Baldoni below.",
      "Lively's initial complaint",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department in late December, alleging \"severe emotional distress\" after she said Baldoni and key stakeholders in the film sexually harassed her and attempted, along with Baldoni's production company, to orchestrate a smear campaign against her.",
      "The complaint was detailed in a New York Times article titled \"'We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\" Included in the report were details surrounding a January 2024 \"all hands\" meeting -- held \"prior to resuming filming of 'It Ends With Us,'\" according to the complaint -- that was held to address Lively's workplace concerns, adding that it was attended by key stakeholders in the film and Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds.",
      "According to the complaint, Lively said she laid out specific demands at that meeting to ensure a safe and professional working environment.",
      "Lively claimed Baldoni and his production company Wayfarer Studios, which produced \"It Ends With Us,\" then engaged in a \"social manipulation\" campaign to \"destroy\" Lively's reputation, according to the complaint. The complaint included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to a Wayfarer publicist, who allegedly wrote that Baldoni \"wants to feel like [Ms. Lively] can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "Freedman, the attorney for Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, denied the allegations.",
      "\"These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,\" Freedman said in a statement to ABC News at the time, in response to Lively's initial complaint. He claimed Lively's complaint was \"yet another desperate attempt to 'fix her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film [...].\"",
      "Lively was criticized during the \"It Ends with Us\" tour for her conduct during press interviews and from some who felt she did not highlight the film's focus of domestic violence enough.",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit against The New York Times",
      "On Dec. 31, Baldoni filed a lawsuit against the Times for libel and false light invasion of privacy, after it published the article about Lively's complaint.",
      "The lawsuit claimed the Times, which included the alleged text messages and email exchanges between Baldoni's publicists Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, had relied on \"cherry-picked\" and altered communications, with details \"stripped of necessary context and deliberately spliced\" to \"mislead.\"",
      "Baldoni is seeking $250 million in damages in his suit against the Times and also listed nine other co-plaintiffs including Wayfarer Studios LLC and his publicists, Abel and Nathan.",
      "Freedman claimed in a statement to \"GMA\" that the Times \"cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites, disregarding journalistic practices and ethics once befitting of the revered publication by using doctored and manipulated texts and intentionally omitting texts which dispute their chosen PR narrative.\"",
      "A Times spokesperson told \"GMA\" that the they \"plan to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\"",
      "\"The role of an independent news organization is to follow the facts where they lead. Our story was meticulously and responsibly reported,\" the spokesperson continued. \"It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article.\"",
      "\"To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the spokesperson claimed. \"We published their full statement in response to the allegations in the article as well.\"",
      "Lively files lawsuit against Baldoni and other defendants for sexual harassment",
      "Also on Dec. 31, Lively formalized her initial California Civil Rights Department complaint into a lawsuit, which reiterated details she previously presented in her complaint.",
      "Attorneys for Lively said in a statement that the actress's \"decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks.\"",
      "\"As alleged in Ms. Lively's federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\" Lively's attorneys claimed. \"Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court. Ms. Lively has brought this litigation in New York, where much of the relevant activities described in the Complaint took place, but we reserve the right to pursue further action in other venues and jurisdictions as appropriate under the law.\"",
      "Both Baldoni and Lively are seeking a jury trial.",

      "Johnson said he was to meet with Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday to discuss ideas for a funding package that Republicans plan to pursue through \"reconciliation\" -- a fast-track process limited to spending and revenue legislation that needs only a majority rather than the 60-vote threshold in the Senate needed to pass legislation. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House and a 3-seat majority in the Senate.",
      "Congressional Republicans have yet to decide on a reconciliation plan. Johnson is pushing Trump's desire for \"one big, beautiful bill\" to fund his agenda but Senate leaders and some conservatives in the House prefer that it be divided into two pieces of legislation.",
      "The negotiated package is expected to include several of Trump's top priorities, which include extending the tax cuts passed during his first term and addressing his immigration reforms, including more funding for Border Patrol and ICE. Trump has also pushed Congress to increase or eliminate the debt limit, though details of any plan remain unclear.",
      "Trump reiterated his preference for one bill when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday, but said he could live with two.",
      "\"Well, I like one big, beautiful bill, and I always have, I always will, he said. But if two is more certain, it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early.\"",
      "Before Trump spoke, Johnson said he remains convinced that the one-bill strategy is the \"best way to go.\"",
      "\"I'm meeting today with Leader Thune about the two ideas,\" Johnson told reporters outside a closed GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning. \"We still remain convinced over here that the one-bill strategy is the best way to go, but there's some senators who have different ideas.\"",
      "\"They're all dear friends and colleagues, and we're going to work on this together. We will get the two chambers united on the same strategy. And I think the president still prefers 'one big, beautiful bill,' as he likes to say, and there's a lot of merit to that -- we could talk about the ins and outs of that maybe at our leadership press conference here.\"",
      "Senate Republican Whip John Barrasso said one of the key objectives in the meeting with Trump will be attempting to forge a clearer path on reconciliation.",
      "\"He's going to be with Senate leadership as well as the entire Senate conference to talk about that exact thing tomorrow and how we get on the same page with the House,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Barrasso said a two-part plan that would deliver wins for Trump early in his presidency and allow for more time to address tax policy that doesn't expire until the end of the year, but the \"goal is the same.\"",
      "\"It was a suggestion by John Thune -- this was before Christmas -- he said 'Let's get an early win on the border.' It was an issue in the election and it is a big issue for the American people and it is a big issue for national security, and we just thought we could get that done in a quicker fashion with a focus on that, on taking the handcuffs off of American energy as well as military strength, and then have the longer time to work on the financial component of this,\" Barrasso said. \"This issues and the urgency of the tax issue doesn't really come into play until l the end of the year to the level that these other issues have the higher urgency right now.\"",
      "Johnson also said he intends to handle the debt limit -- another Trump priority -- in the reconciliation process, which Republicans could try pass in both chambers without Democratic support.",
      "\"That way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we again get to determine the details of that. If it runs through the regular order, regular process\u2026 then you have to have both parties negotiating. And we feel like we are in better stead to do it ourselves,\" he said.",
      "Johnson said members will have \"lengthy\" sessions to go over the plan for reconciliation since there are \"broad opinions\" on how to handle it.",
      "\"Republicans in this majority in the House and Senate \u2013 our intention, our mission is to reduce spending in a meaningful way so we can get, restore fiscal sanity\u2026 so raising the debt limit is a necessary step so we don't give the appearance that we're going to default in some way on the nation's debt,\" he added.",
      "Johnson said this does not mean Republicans will \"tolerate\" spending more to the new debt limit because the \"commitment\" is to reduce spending, but the final formula has not been determined.",
      "The speaker also told reporters that he'll likely speak with Trump on Tuesday, ahead of the president-elect's visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
      "\"I'm sure I'll speak with him today, probably this afternoon, and when he's in town, I'm sure we'll get together,\" Johnson said. \"He and I both have a very busy schedule. He's trying to jam a lot into that visit on the Hill, so we're sympathetic to that.\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson said there will be more discussions on Trump's agenda when he meets with House Republicans at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.",
      "\"He's bringing in big groups of House Republicans to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend three days in a row to meet with and talk with all of our team members about what's ahead of us and the challenges and how we can accomplish all this together. So we're very excited about that. The president-elect is excited about it, and we all are as well,\" Johnson said.",
      "Senate Republicans are preparing to meet with President-Elect Trump in the Capitol tomorrow, and one of their key objectives will be attempting to forge a clearer path about how to proceed with advancing Trump's agenda through a fast-track budget tool called reconciliation, Republican Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo. said.",
      "\"He's going to be with Senate leadership as well as the entire Senate conference to talk about that exact thing tomorrow and how we get on the same page with the House,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Barrasso said today that the \"goal is the same\" regardless of whether Congress ultimately proceeds with a one-part bill, as Speaker Johnson and Trump have suggested, or with a two-part strategy championed by Majority Leader Thune.",
      "But he made the case for a two-part plan that would deliver wins for Trump early in his presidency and allow for more time to address tax policy that doesn't expire until the end of the year.",
      "\"It was a suggestion by John Thune -- this was before Christmas -- he said 'Let's get an early win on the border.' It was an issue in the election and it is a big issue for the American people and it is a big issue for national security, and we just thought we could get that done in a quicker fashion with a focus on that, on taking the handcuffs off of American energy as well as military strength, and then have the longer time to work on the financial component of this,\" Barrasso said. \"This issues and the urgency of the tax issue doesn't really come into play until l the end of the year to the level that these other issues have the higher urgency right now.\"",
      "Senate Republicans have slightly more breathing room on these measures than their House colleagues as they have a 3-seat GOP majority. In the House, Johnson might only be able to afford to lose a single Republican, so his preference for one large bill appears to be focused on getting his members together.",
      "\"If you put a number of high priority issues together, then people are more apt to vote for the larger package, because even though there may be something in it that doesn't meet their preference, they're not going to be willing to vote against the larger measures that are such, such high priority for the American people and for President Trump,\" Johnson told Newsmax on Monday.",

      "Unauthorized immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes could be be deported.",
      "The House voted at 1 p.m. Tuesday on the Laken Riley Act, passing the bill as its first piece of legislation of the 119th Congress on a vote of 264 to 159.",
      "Forty-eight Democrats voted in favor of the bill.",
      "\u201cLaken Riley was brutally murdered by an illegal alien that President Biden and the Democrats let into this country with their open border policy,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement after the vote. \"It is hard to believe after countless horrific stories like Laken\u2019s, ANY House Democrats would vote against deporting illegal aliens who commit violent crimes against American citizens.",
      "\u201cBut 159 just did, demonstrating some Democrats have ignored the loud and clear message from voters in this election who demanded secure borders, the deportation of violent illegal aliens, and laws that put the safety and security of the American people first,\" he added.",
      "Reintroduced by Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican, the legislation pins Riley's death on the Biden administration's open-border policies and grants power to attorneys general to sue the federal government if they can show their states are being harmed over failure to implement national immigration policies. The measure also allows states to sue the Department of Homeland Security for harm caused to citizens allegedly due to illegal immigration.",
      "The bill was named after Riley, a nursing student who was murdered by illegal immigrant Jose Ibarra while jogging on campus at the University of Georgia. Ibarra was sentenced to life in prison for the murder.",
      "\"The only thing President Biden did after Laken's tragic death was apologize for calling her murderer an illegal,\" Johnson said ahead of the vote. \"That's outrageous. We all know the real victim here was young Laken. There are real consequences to policy decisions. This one was deadly.\"",
      "The House previously passed the bill in March by a vote of 251-170, with 37 Democrats voting in favor. The bill was expected to pass again with bipartisan support.",
      "\u201cHouse Republicans heard the voices of those who wanted change and voted to pass the Laken Riley Act,\" Johnson said Tuesday. \"We will always fight to protect Americans, and today\u2019s success is just the beginning of Republican efforts to undo the catastrophic damage caused by years of the Democrats\u2019 failed leadership.\u201d",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune teed up a procedural vote on the Laken Riley Act, which could occur as soon as this week. It will be one of the first legislative actions taken by the new Senate.",
      "The bill will need 60 votes to advance through the upper chamber. Even with the Republicans' new 53-vote majority, it could prove difficult to court the necessary Democratic support to advance it.",
      "So far, only one Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, is reportedly co-sponsoring the bill, which is being led in the chamber by Sens. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Ted Budd, R-N.C. It is unclear whether there will be requisite Democratic support to clear the Senate.",
      "The Senate, under Democratic leadership last session, never considered the act as a standalone bill. But it previously considered the Laken Riley Act when Senate Republicans forced a vote on it as an amendment to a sweeping government funding package in March. The amendment was considered as a government shutdown loomed, and changes to the bill would have likely forced a government shutdown.",
      "No Democrats voted for it at the time, though it later earned the support of Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who lost reelection to Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:15:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Pentagon agreed to a settlement with LGBTQ+ veterans discharged under \"don't ask, don't tell\" that would open up access to benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The settlement would allow an estimated 30,000 veterans access to benefits.",
      "The Pentagon has reached a legal settlement that will make it easier for an estimated 30,000 veterans who were separated from the military because they were LGBTQ+ to have their discharge papers updated to eliminate any reference to their sexual orientation, enabling them to receive veterans benefits.",
      "LGBTQ+ veterans who were denied an honorable discharge when they were separated will also be eligible for an immediate review to upgrade their discharges.",
      "The settlement, which must still be approved by a federal judge, applies to service members separated under the Pentagon's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that was in effect from 1994 to 2011 and earlier similar policies that prevented LGBTQ+ individuals from serving in the military.",
      "Under don't ask, don't tell, LGBTQ+ service members could not be open about their sexual orientation, but could be separated administratively from the military if their sexual orientation became known. The policy drew its name from the idea that the military services would not \"ask\" service members about their sexual orientation, and gay and lesbian service members couldn't \"tell.\"",
      "The deal stems from a federal civil rights lawsuit, Farrell vs. Department of Defense, filed in August 2023 by five veterans who said that the Pentagon did not grant them honorable discharges or remove language specifying their sexuality from their service records following the 2011 repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell.\"",
      "A spokesman for the legal team representing the five veterans confirmed the proposed settlement to ABC News. The Pentagon referred questions about the settlement to the Justice Department. CBS News was first to report the the proposed settlement.",
      "\"Coming from a family with a long history of military service, I was beyond proud to enlist in 1985 to contribute to my country,\" said Sherrill Farrell, a Navy veteran who was the lead plaintiff in the case.",
      "\"When I was discharged because of my sexual orientation, I felt that my country was telling me that my service was not valuable -- that I was \"less than\" because of who I loved,\" she said. \"Today, I am once again proud to have served my country by standing up for veterans like myself, and ensuring our honor is recognized.\"",
      "Prior to the lawsuit, the Defense Department had streamlined procedures for those eligible to seek a review of their cases within a 10-month process. But the plaintiffs in the case said that process was \"constitutionally inadequate\" because it placed the burden on individuals to obtain their old personnel records, something that could take months or years, in effect delaying access to benefits.",
      "\"For the more than 30,000 veterans in the class action, this settlement represents a meaningful step toward restoring their honor and providing long-overdue recognition for their service to the nation,\" Zak Sawyer, a spokesman for legal team representing the veterans told ABC News. According to the Pentagon, 13,000 service members were separated under the don't ask, don't tell policy that replaced similar earlier policies for which it is difficult to get precise statistics, but the legal team believes it to be at least 30,000 from 1980 to 2011.",
      "\"Currently, for those discharged with characterizations other than Honorable, it can be arduous, if not impossible, to access critical benefits, including health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, funding for higher education, home loan financing, job benefits, and more,\" Sawyer added.",
      "\"In applying for these benefits or subsequent jobs, veterans must also prove their military service, which effectively amounts to \"outing\" their sexual orientation,\" he said. \"This proposed settlement will alleviate the immense challenges faced by LGBTQ+ veterans in seeking corrections to their discharge records and would ameliorate the current process, which is convoluted, burdensome, and often fraught with re-traumatization and stigma.\"",
      "Most of the 13,000 service members the Pentagon says were separated from the military under don't ask, don't tell received honorable discharges, but about 2,000 received dishonorable discharges.",
      "When the policy was repealed in 2011, many of those who had been dishonorably discharged were able to appeal their cases and received upgrades to honorable discharges, but the Pentagon last year proactively undertook a program that reviewed 851 cases of those that had not asked for appeals, possibly because they did not know they could.",
      "When that review ended in October, the Pentagon said that 96.8% of the veterans had received some form of relief in their cases.",
      "\"It has been an honor to stand alongside and represent these brave veterans in their fight for justice,\" said Jocelyn Larkin, an attorney with Impact Fund that represented the plaintiffs.",
      "\"This proposed settlement is a historic step forward, providing LGBTQ+ veterans with a critical opportunity to request revisions to their discharge records,\" Larkin said.",
      "\"For too long, veterans who were unjustly discharged had to navigate a confusing and burdensome system to correct their records,\" she said. \"This settlement brings a much-needed resolution by simplifying that process and restoring the dignity that these veterans rightfully deserve for their service.\"",
      "If the settlement is approved by the judge overseeing the case, it is possible that as early as summer 2025 affected veterans would be able to request that their records be changed.",
      "\"As a Marine, I was proud to stand alongside my fellow service members, embracing the core values of honor, courage, and commitment,\" said Jules Sohn, a Marine veteran and one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"However, the pain and injustice of being discharged under discriminatory policies like 'don't ask, don't tell' have lingered for years,\" she added. \"This settlement represents not just a recognition of those wrongs but a step toward ensuring that no service member ever faces such prejudice again.\"",

Also on the ballot are Democrat JJ Singh and Republican Ram Venkatachalam, who are racing to replace Srinivasan in the state House of Delegates after he vacated his seat to run in the special Senate election.",
      "In central Goochland County, Republican Luther Cifers is up against Democrat Jack Trammell, a college professor, in a state Senate race. They hope to succeed U.S. Rep. John McGuire, who clinched Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District after narrowly defeating former U.S. Rep. Bob Good by less than a percentage point in a bitter primary, which led to a recount in August.",
      "The special elections are being closely watched by outside observers to gauge voters\u2019 moods after November\u2019s presidential race, which left many Democrats reckoning with the party\u2019s losses in federal elections. In Virginia, Senate Democrats have a narrow 20-18 majority since McGuire and Subramanyam's resignations, making the special elections key to the party\u2019s efforts to preserve a majority in both chambers. In the House of Delegates, Democrats have a 50-49 lead following Srinivasan\u2019s departure.",
      "Srinivasan, the first Indian American immigrant elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, and Singh, a Virginia native and the son of Indian immigrants, are hoping to hold the Democratic seats within a county where data shows that Vice President Kamala Harris received 57% of the vote in her failed bid against President-elect Donald Trump. Both Singh and Srinivasan have largely centered their campaigns around abortion rights in Virginia. It comes at a time when state Democrats are working to enshrine a constitutional right to an abortion in the state.",
      "\u201cWhat motivates me is the high-stakes election,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cThe Senate majority is on the line. The constitutional amendment is on the line.\u201d",
      "Harding, the daughter of Turkish Uzbek immigrants and Venkatachalam, an Indian American immigrant, aim to flip the senate and house seats from Democrats. Both candidates, who each unsuccessfully ran for the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors in 2023, have centered their state campaigns along party lines, such as parents\u2019 rights, crime and the economy.",
      "\u201cOur schools are faltering and riddled with politics and division, our neighbors have been made victims of illegal migrant crime, and our families are struggling to afford groceries, gas, and housing,\u201d Harding said in a statement when launching her campaign. \u201cAll of this could change if we win this election and give Governor Youngkin a new majority in the Senate.\u201d",
      "In the 10th State Senate district, conservatives are putting their weight behind Cifers to succeed McGuire following a lengthy, multi-ballot primary among Republican voters last month. Cifers, a Prince Edward County resident and president of a Virginia kayaking business, said he never envisioned himself running for office but wanted to bring a different perspective to the legislature, particularly regarding housing and the economy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about doing the right thing, making sure that we\u2019re constitutionally minded and respecting the will of the voters before I\u2019m super interested in getting into party politics,\u201d Cifers said.",
      "Trammell, who unsuccessfully ran for the 7th U.S. House District in 2014, is hoping to flip the Republican stronghold, which supported Trump by more than 25 points in November, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Trammell said he partly decided to run for office because he believed his community should have a competitive electoral process.",
      "\u201cThere are factors that are transforming District 10,\u201d he said. \u201cTo call it a monolithic, traditional-rural Republican district is a little bit of a disservice to the people who are actually living there, working there and raising families there now.\u201d",

      "The president-elect acknowledges opposition to his plan from some Republicans.",
      "After nearly derailing a spending bill and forcing a government shutdown last month, President-elect Donald Trump continues to shake up legislative business on Capitol Hill, offering shifting views in recent days on how Republicans should fund his major policy initiatives.",
      "The negotiated package is expected to include several of Trump\u2019s top priorities, which include extending the tax cuts passed during his first term and addressing his immigration reforms, including more funding for Border Patrol and ICE. Trump has also pushed Congress to increase or eliminate the debt limit, though details of any plan remain unclear.",
      "With control of both Congress and the White House, Republicans could implement Trump's legislative agenda without Democratic support using a procedural tool called reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass spending bills instead of a 60-vote threshold.",
      "But after advocating on Sunday for \"one big, beautiful bill\" to pay for his agenda, Trump on Monday acknowledged opposition from some Republicans to his ambitious plan and said he would consider alternatives.",
      "Trump is expected to meet with Senate Republicans during their closed-door lunch on Wednesday, ABC News has learned from multiple sources, as the president-elect continues to engage with House and Senate leadership over how to most effectively advance his agenda after he takes office.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans on Saturday during a closed-door retreat to map out their legislative agenda that Trump wants Congress to pass one sweeping bill.",
      "On Sunday morning, the speaker told Fox Business, \u201cAt the end of the day, President Trump is going to prefer, as he likes to say, 'one big, beautiful bill.' And there's a lot of merit to that, because we can put it all together, one big up-or-down vote, which can save the country, quite literally, because there are so many elements to it.\u201d",
      "Trump late Sunday first advocated for Congress to pass one sweeping bill through reconciliation rather than in multiple bills.",
      "\"Members of Congress are getting to work on one powerful Bill that will bring our Country back, and make it greater than ever before,\" Trump posted on Truth Social, alluding to the reconciliation package.",
      "Trump advocated for \"one, beautiful bill,\" during an appearance on the \"Hugh Hewitt Show\" on Monday morning, but later said he could be willing to break the legislative package into two.",
      "\"I would prefer one, but I will do whatever needs to be done to get it passed,\" Trump told Hewitt.",
      "Trump's openness to change reflects the reality that a one-bill proposal is a break from the two-package deal Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republicans have laid out.",
      "\"We have a lot of respect for Senator Thune, as you know, he may have a little bit of a different view of it,\" Trump told Hewitt. \"I heard other senators yesterday, including Lindsey [Graham], talking about it. They prefer it the other way. So I'm open. I'm open to either way, as long as we get something passed as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Thune brushed off questions about the differing strategies while heading into the Senate chamber on Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are working through all that. The process issues to me are a lot less important than the result,\u201d he said.",
      "Taking the reconciliation path will be a major challenge to pass, given the razor-thin GOP majority in the House. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republican members that has endorsed a two-step plan, could stand in the way.",
      "\u201cThere are a group of us who support breaking it up into two pieces,\" Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris said on Saturday in a Fox News interview. \"The first piece, a very small border piece where we give the president the money that he needs to secure our southern border and start deporting illegal, criminal aliens.\u201d",
      "Trump last month nearly caused the government to shutdown when he demanded at the 11th hour that a bipartisan temporary funding bill include provisions to suspend the debt ceiling. That bill failed after Democrats and conservative Republicans voted against it. The House later passed a bill that was closer to the original measure without addressing the debt ceiling.",
      "Johnson has shown urgency to get legislation passed despite Trump's shifting position as the speaker and president-elect continue to work together to deliver on Trump\u2019s ambitious promises during his first 100 days in office.",
      "Johnson said the goal is to pass a reconciliation package by the first week of April so Trump could sign it into law by the end of April. He added, \u201cIn a worst-case scenario, Memorial Day\" for getting it to Trump\u2019s desk.",
      "Johnson said Monday he had talked to Trump about the evolving plan late Sunday and again Monday morning.",
      "\u201cSo, some people like the one bill strategy, some people like the two-bill strategy. We will work that out,\" Johnson said as he entered the Capitol. \"I'm in dialogue this morning with Senator Thune, and the two houses will get together and we'll get it done.\u201d",

      "They would joke that, \u201cit\u2019s not a competition as long as his house gets finished first,\u201d Reckford said of the former president. \u201cAnd you did not want to get that submarine commander glare if he thought you weren't working hard enough.\u201d",
      "Habitat for Humanity now works in 70 countries and reported that some 910,000 people volunteered with them in 2023. Some 4,447 homes in 14 countries have been built through the Carter Work Project, according to Habitat.",
      "Cleora Taylor met the Carters in August 2018 when they helped build 41 new homes in South Bend and Mishawaka, Indiana. Taylor recalled how the former president greeted her by name and knew about her children, including her daughter, who was 11 at the time and has autism.",
      "\u201cIt means so much to me that he knew me,\u201d said Taylor, speaking in 2023 from her living room in the home the Carters helped her build, on a street named Carter Court.",
      "\u201cI was born in 82, so I\u2019m like, I think this is going to be a big deal,\u201d she said, when she found out the home she now owns would be built alongside the former president. \u201cThis is a big opportunity for my kids and I to be a part of this.\u201d",
      "Rosalynn Carter, who died in 2023, was long an advocate for mental health support while her husband held political offices, and also campaigned for the recognition of the work of caregivers.",
      "\u201cThere are only four kinds of people in this world,\u201d the former first lady is often quoted as saying. \u201cThose who have been caregivers; those who are currently caregivers; those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.\u201d",
      "In 1987, she established the nonprofit now called the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers that advocates for caregivers and offers support to people caring for others in their lives. Philanthropist Melinda French Gates pledged to match up to $500,000 in donations to the institute for GivingTuesday in December. Her organization Pivotal said $253,000 was raised for RCI in the campaign.",

      "Jimmy Carter's state funeral moves to Washington after observances in his native Georgia",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nearly 44 years after Jimmy Carter left the nation's capital in humbling defeat, the 39th president returns to Washington for three days of state funeral rites starting on Tuesday.",
      "Carter\u2019s remains, which have been lying in repose at the Carter Presidential Center since Saturday, will leave the Atlanta campus Tuesday morning, accompanied by his children and extended family. Special Air Mission 39 will depart Dobbins Air Reserve Base north of Atlanta and arrive at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, with a motorcade into Washington and the Capitol, where members of Congress will pay their respects at an afternoon service.",
      "Carter, who died Dec. 29 at the age of 100, will then lie in state Tuesday night and again Wednesday. He then receives a state funeral Thursday at Washington National Cathedral. President Joe Biden will deliver a eulogy.",
      "There will be the familiar rituals that follow a president\u2019s death \u2014 the Air Force ride back to the Beltway, a military honor guard carrying a flag-draped casket up the Capitol steps, the Lincoln catafalque in the Rotunda. There also will be symbolism unique to Carter: His hearse will stop at the U.S. Navy Memorial, where his remains will be transferred to a horse-drawn caisson for rest of his trip to the Capitol. The location nods to Carter\u2019s place as the lone U.S. Naval Academy graduate to become commander in chief.",
      "All of the pomp will carry some irony for the Democrat who went from his family peanut warehouse to the Governor\u2019s Mansion and eventually the White House. Carter won the presidency as the smiling Baptist and technocratic engineer who promised to change the ways of Washington \u2014 and eschewed many of those unwritten rules ways when he got there.",
      "\u201cJimmy Carter was always an outsider,\u201d said biographer Jonathan Alter, explaining how Carter capitalized on the fallout of the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal that toppled Richard Nixon. \u201cThe country was thirsting for moral renewal and for Carter, as this genuinely religious figure, to come in and clean things up.\"",
      "From 1977 to 1981, Carter was the city\u2019s highest-ranking resident. But he never mastered it.",
      "\u201cHe could be prickly and a not very appealing personality\u201d in a town that thrives on relationships, Alter said, describing a president who struggled with schmoozing lawmakers and reporters.",
      "The gatekeepers of Washington society never embraced Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, either, not quite knowing what to make of the small-town Southerners who carried their own luggage and bought their clothes off the rack. Carter sold what had been the presidential yacht, a perk his predecessors had used to wine and dine Capitol power players.",
      "Early in Carter\u2019s presidency, Washington Post society columnist Sally Quinn tagged the Carters and their West Wing as \u201can alien tribe,\u201d incapable of \u201cplaying \u2018the game.\u2019\u201d An elite Georgetown hostess herself, Quinn nodded to Washington\u2019s \u201cfrivolity\u201d but nonetheless mocked \u201cthe Carter people\u201d as \u201cnot, in fact, comfortable in limousines, yachts, or in elegant salons, in black tie\u201d or with \u201cplace cards, servants, six courses, different forks, three wines ... and after-dinner mingling.\u201d",
      "He endured a rocky four years that left him without enough friends in the town\u2019s power circles and, ultimately, across an electorate that delivered nearly 500 Electoral College votes to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election.",
      "Long after leaving office, Carter still bemoaned a political cartoon published around his inauguration that depicted his family approaching the White House with his mother, \u201cMiss Lillian,\u201d chewing on a hayseed.",
      "Carter often flouted the ceremonial trappings that have been on display in Georgia and will continue in Washington.",
      "As president, he wanted to keep the Marine Band from playing \u201cHail to the Chief,\u201d thinking it elevated the president too much. His advisers convinced him to accept it as part of the job. And the song played Saturday as he arrived at his presidential center after a motorcade through his hometown of Plains and past his boyhood farm.",
      "He also never used his full name, James Earl Carter Jr., even taking the oath of office. His full name was printed on memorial cards given to all mourners who paid their respects in Atlanta.",
      "He once addressed the nation from the White House residence wearing a cardigan, now on display at his museum and library. His remains now rest in a wooden casket being carried and guarded by military pallbearers in their impeccable dress uniforms.",
      "\u201cHe was a simple man in so many ways,\u201d said Brad Webb, an Army veteran who came to honor the former president at his library, which is on the same campus as The Carter Center, where the former president and first lady based their decades of advocacy for democracy, public health and human rights in the developing world.",
      "\u201cHe was also a complicated man, who took his defeat and did so much good in the world,\" said Webb, who voted for Republican Gerald Ford in 1976 and Reagan in 1980. \u201cAnd, looking back, some of the things in his presidency \u2014 the inflation, the Iran hostages, the energy crisis \u2014 were really things that no president can actually control. We get to look back with some perspective and understand that he was an excellent former president but also had a presidency we can appreciate more than we did as it was happening.\u201d"

      "The White House says President Joe Biden will establish two new national monuments in California that will honor Native American tribes",
      "LOS ANGELES -- President Joe Biden is establishing two new national monuments in California that will honor Native American tribes, the White House confirmed Tuesday, as Biden seeks to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 through his \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d initiative.",
      "Proclamations set to be signed Tuesday will create the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument in Northern California. The declarations bar drilling and mining and other development on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site and roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) near the Oregon border in Northern California.",
      "The new monuments will protect clean water for communities, honor areas of cultural significance to tribal nations and Indigenous peoples, and enhance access to nature, the White House said.",
      "Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is set to visit Los Angeles and the Eastern Coachella Valley on Tuesday after meeting Monday with the families of the victims in the New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans.",
      "Biden announced Monday he will ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California and other West Coast states. The plan is intended to block possible efforts by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling.",
      "The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president\u2019s \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.",
      "The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument. The area is a spiritual center for the Pit River and Modoc Tribes and encompasses mountain woodlands and meadows that are home to rare flowers and wildlife.",
      "A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, in early 2023. The monument would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River.",
      "Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military history sites.",
      "\u201cThe designation of the Chuckwalla and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monuments in California marks an historic step toward protecting lands of profound cultural, ecological and historical significance for all Americans,\" said Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.",
      "The new monuments \u201chonor the enduring stewardship of Tribal Nations and the tireless efforts of local communities and conservation advocates who fought to safeguard these irreplaceable landscapes for future generations,'' Hauser said.",
      "National monuments like Chuckwalla and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla play a key role in addressing historical injustices and ensuring a more inclusive telling of America\u2019s history, she said.",
      "The Chuckwalla monument is intended to honor tribal sovereignty by including local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.",
      "\u201cThe protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,\u201d the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. \u201cTribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place.\u201d",
      "In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California \u2014 the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved.",
      "Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to manage tribal land with the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League, which is conveying the land to the tribe.",

      "A police transcript says the man accused of setting a woman on fire inside a New York City subway told detectives that he had no recollection of the fatal attack",
      "NEW YORK -- The man accused of setting a woman on fire inside a New York City subway told detectives, \u201cOh, damn, that\u2019s me,\u201d when he saw video of the attack but said he couldn\u2019t remember anything, according to a transcript released Tuesday.",
      "The interview was made public shortly after Sebastian Zapeta, 33, entered a plea of not guilty on murder and arson charges in a Brooklyn court. Prosecutors say he set fire to Debrina Kawam, 57, aboard a stopped train in the early morning hours of Dec. 22, fanned the flames with a shirt and watched the woman burn from a subway bench.",
      "Inside a Brooklyn precinct later that day, authorities described Zapeta as reacting with \u201cdisgust\u201d and \u201cstrangeness\u201d to the video, wiping his eyes and exclaiming in Spanish, \u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d according to the transcript.",
      "\u201cI am very sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d he then told detectives. \"I don\u2019t know what happened, but I\u2019m very sorry for that woman.\u201d",
      "He added that he had been drinking heavily throughout the night and fallen asleep on the subway, but did not remember what happened next.",
      "Zapeta, a Guatemalan citizen who authorities say entered the country illegally after being deported in 2018, had been living in a Brooklyn shelter and working as a roofer. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole on the murder charge.",
      "During a brief arraignment Tuesday, Zapeta kept his gaze on the floor as his attorney entered a plea of not guilty, nodding his head slightly while a Spanish translator whispered in his ear.",
      "He was previously arraigned last month on a criminal complaint, but in New York, all felony cases require a grand jury indictment to proceed to trial unless a defendant waives that requirement.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office will seek the maximum punishment of life in prison with no chance of parole. He said after Zapeta was indicted in December that prosecutors are pursuing the charges \u201cunder the theory that this was an intentional act\u201d but noted the indictment includes a \u201cdepraved indifference\u201d murder charge.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to fathom what could lead someone to commit the atrocious and horrific murder with which this defendant is charged,\u201d Gonzalez said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cMs. Kawam and her loved ones deserve a measure of justice and New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in the subways.\u201d",
      "Zapeta\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment Monday evening.",
      "Kawam grew up in Little Falls, New Jersey, and attended Passaic Valley Regional High School, where she was a popular student, cheerleader and pancake house worker, her childhood and young adult friends told The New York Times.",
      "In her 20s, she traveled to Jamaica, Mexico, the Bahamas and Las Vegas with friends and worked a variety of jobs that she never held too long, a friend, Cindy Certosimo Bowie told the Times. The Associated Press has left messages for possible relatives.",
      "In the early 2000s, she worked at the pharmaceutical giant Merck, but her life took a rocky turn at some point. She went into debt, had liens filed against her and filed for bankruptcy, according to public records. A Debrina Kawam listed in court records also was arrested several times in minor crimes.",
      "In her bankruptcy filed in 2008, she listed more than $90,000 in debt, no income and assets that included her clothes, a futon, a television and a Dodge Neon worth $800.",
      "She briefly stayed at a New York homeless shelter after moving to the city recently, according to the Department of Social Services. It didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The killing has renewed discussion about safety in the nation\u2019s largest mass transit system even as crime in the subway remains relatively rare.",
      "Transit crime is down for the second straight year, with a 5.4% drop last year compared to 2023, according to data released by police Monday, which also showed a 3% overall drop in major crimes citywide.",
      "Still, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a Monday news conference discussing the statistics that riders simply \u201cdon\u2019t feel safe.\u201d",
      "In response, she said the department will surge more than 200 officers onto subway trains and deploy more officers onto subway platforms in the 50 highest-crime stations in the city.",
      "\u201cWe know that 78% of transit crime occurs on trains and on platforms, and that is quite obviously where our officers need to be,\u201d Tisch said. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It's been decades since thousands of human bones and bone fragments were unearthed on a suspected Indiana serial killer\u2019s property",
      "WESTFIELD, Ind. -- Decades after investigators unearthed thousands of human bones and bone fragments on a suspected Indiana serial killer\u2019s property, a renewed quest is playing out in laboratories to solve a long-running mystery: Who were they?",
      "A new team working to identify the unknown dead says the key to their success will be getting relatives of men who vanished between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s to provide samples of their own DNA.",
      "Those samples can then be screened against DNA profiles scientists are extracting from the remains, which were found starting in 1996 on Herbert Baumeister\u2019s sprawling suburban Indianapolis property.",
      "The original investigators believed that at least 25 people were buried at Baumeister\u2019s 18-acre (7.3-hectare) Fox Hollow Farm estate in Westfield, based on evidence that included 10,000 bones and bone fragments, as well as handcuffs and shotgun shells.",
      "Baumeister, a 49-year-old thrift store owner and married father of three, killed himself in Canada in July 1996 before police could question him, taking with him many secrets, including the names of his presumed victims.",
      "Investigators believed that while his family was away on trips, Baumeister, who frequented gay bars in Indianapolis, lured men to his home, where he killed and buried them.",
      "By the late 1990s, authorities had identified eight men using dental records and available DNA technologies. But then those efforts stopped, although the remains of at least 17 people may have still been unidentified.",
      "Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison said the renewed identification effort revealed that county officials at the time decided not to fund additional DNA testing, which \u201cessentially halted further efforts to identify the victims and placed the cost of a homicide investigation on family members of missing people.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t speak for those investigators, but it was just game over,\u201d Jellison said.",
      "As decades slipped by, the bones and fragments sat in boxes at the University of Indianapolis' Human Identification Center, whose staff helped excavate the remains.",
      "That changed after Eric Pranger sent Jellison a Facebook message in late 2022. The Indianapolis man's family had long believed his older cousin, Allen Livingston, was among Baumeister\u2019s victims.",
      "Livingston was 27 when he vanished in August 1993 after getting into someone else\u2019s car in downtown Indianapolis. After hearing about Baumeister three years later, his mother, Sharon Livingston, and other relatives began suspecting that Allen, who was bisexual, was among the dead.",
      "Jellison was about to take office when Pranger asked if he could help get some answers for his aunt, who had serious health problems.",
      "\u201cHow do you say to no to that? That\u2019s our job as coroners by statute, to identify the deceased,\u201d Jellison said.",
      "In late 2022, police took DNA samples from Sharon Livingston and one of her daughters. Jellison began working with a team that includes the Indiana State Police, the FBI, the Human Identification Center, local law enforcement and a private company that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy.",
      "Staff at the Human Identification Center, where the remains are stored in a temperature- and humidity-controlled space, selected some of the most promising bones for DNA analysis.",
      "At the Indiana State Police Laboratory, scientists cut out sections of bone, froze them with liquid nitrogen and pulverized them into a fine powder. They then used heat and chemicals to break open bone cells in the first step toward extracting a full DNA profile.",
      "Nearly a year after hearing from Pranger, Jellison announced in October 2023 that a ninth Baumeister victim had been identified: Allen Livingston.",
      "Sharon Livingston finally received some form of closure. She died in November 2024.",
      "\u201cIt made me happy to be able to do this for my aunt,\" Pranger, 34, said. \u201cI\u2019m the one who got the ball rolling to bring her son home after 30 years and I felt privileged.\"",
      "\u201cAfter Allen was identified I was so excited and then after the fact I asked myself, `Now what? I got answers, but what about all the other families?\u2019\u201d Pranger added.",
      "Jellison said about 40 DNA samples have been submitted by people who believe a missing male relative may have been killed by Baumeister. He said those are entered into the FBI\u2019s Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, but are used solely for identifying missing people.",
      "The coroner and his partners hope to get more DNA samples from relatives of men from across the U.S. who vanished between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. They noted the men may have been traveling and stopped in Indianapolis to visit friends or sample its nightlife.",
      "To date, scientists have extracted eight unique DNA profiles \u2014 all male \u2014 from more than 70 of the 100 bones that were sent to the Indiana State Police Laboratory by Dr. Krista Latham, the Human Identification Center's director.",
      "One matched DNA samples provided by Livingston\u2019s mother and sister. Four matched four of the eight men first identified in the 1990s: Jeffrey Jones, Manuel Resendez, Johnny Bayer and Richard Hamilton.",
      "The three other DNA profiles remain unidentified and two are still undergoing testing. Those three have boosted Baumeister\u2019s presumed victims to 12.",
      "Jellison and his partners say their identification effort could take several more years to complete.",
      "Most of the bones were crushed and burned, reducing their potential to yield usable DNA. Latham, a professor of biology and anthropology, said bone fragments deemed in poor shape are being held back from the destructive testing process in hope that future DNA technologies can unlock their secrets.",
      "She noted some of the men may have been estranged from relatives or ostracized because of their sexuality. No one may have noticed when they vanished.",
      "\u201cThese are individuals who were marginalized in life. And we just need to make sure that that\u2019s not continuing in death as well,\u201d Latham said.",
      "For the ongoing work, Jellison has obtained DNA reference samples from relatives of seven of the eight men originally identified in the 1990s. The eighth man, Steven Hale, was adopted and efforts to locate biological relatives have thus far failed, the coroner said.",
      "Relatives of missing men who want to provide family DNA reference samples for the effort to identify remains can contact the Indiana State Police missing persons hotline at 833-466-2653 or the Hamilton County Coroner\u2019s Office at 317-770-4415.",
      "As remains are identified, piece by piece, families can opt to have them cremated and interred at a memorial dedicated in August in Westfield. It includes a plaque with the names of the nine identified victims, with room for more names.",
      "Linda Znachko, whose nonprofit Indianapolis-based ministry He Knows Your Name, paid for the monument, said at the memorial's dedication that the identification campaign \"will bring honor to those who lost their lives at the Fox Hollow tragedy.\u201d Remains belonging to Livingston and Jeffrey Jones were added to the memorial's ossuary and white doves were released during the dedication.",
      "Livingston\u2019s younger sister, Shannon Doughty, attended with several relatives, including Pranger. She said it was a relief finally knowing what happened to her brother, despite his tragic end.",
      "\u201cAt least you know,\u201d said Doughty, 46. \u201cThe fear of the unknown is the worst right? So just knowing, it\u2019s a multitude of emotions. You wanted to know but you didn\u2019t want to know. But you needed to know.\u201d"

      "President Joe Biden is signing a proclamation to establish two new national monuments in California in part to honor two tribes",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is signing a proclamation to establish two new national monuments in California, in part to honor two tribes, a person familiar with the decision said Monday.",
      "The proclamation will create the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument in Northern California, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans that were to be announced Tuesday in California.",
      "The declaration bars drilling and mining and other development on the 600,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) area in Southern California and roughly 200,000 acres (800 square kilometers) in Northern California.",
      "The establishment of new monuments were first reported in The Washington Post. Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is in New Orleans on Monday meeting with the families of the victims in the New Year's attack in the French Quarter and was heading to California later Monday.",
      "The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president\u2019s \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.",
      "The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the S\u00e1tt\u00edtla National Monument. A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, at the start of 2023.",
      "The area would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River.",
      "Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military history sites. The California Legislature passed a resolution in August 2024 to urge Biden to establish the Chuckwalla National Monument and another National Park Service-managed national monument adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park, as well as the Kw\u2019ts\u00e1n National Monument, which would border Mexico and Arizona.",
      "Tribal leaders have also called for the Chuckwalla monument to honor tribal sovereignty to include local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.",
      "\u201cThe protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,\" the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. \u201cTribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place.\u201d",
      "In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California \u2014 the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved.",
      "Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to receive tribal land back from the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in New York City on Monday said that Rudy Giuliani was in contempt of court for failing to properly respond to requests for information as he turned over assets to satisfy a $148 million defamation judgment granted to two Georgia election workers.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman ruled after hearing Giuliani testify for a second day at a contempt hearing called after lawyers for the election workers said the former New York City mayor had failed to properly comply with evidence production requests over the last few months.",
      "On Friday, Giuliani testified for about three hours in Liman's Manhattan courtroom, but the judge permitted him to finish testifying remotely on Monday from his condominium in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "At the start of the hearing Monday, Giuliani had an American flag backdrop, which he said he uses for a program he conducts over the internet, but the judge told him to change it to a plain background.",
      "Giuliani conceded during Monday\u2019s testimony that he sometimes did not turn over everything requested because he believed the requests were overly broad or inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by lawyers for the plaintiffs.",
      "He also said he sometimes had trouble turning over information regarding his assets because of numerous criminal and civil court cases requiring him to produce factual information.",
      "Giuliani, 80, said the demands to turn over materials made it \u201cimpossible to function in an official way\u201d about 30% to 40% of the time.",
      "The election workers\u2019 lawyers say Giuliani has displayed a \u201cconsistent pattern of willful defiance\u201d of Liman\u2019s October order to give up assets after he was found liable in 2023 for defaming their clients by falsely accusing them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election.",
      "They said in court papers that he has turned over a Mercedes-Benz and his New York apartment but not the paperwork necessary to monetize the assets. And they said he has failed to surrender watches and sports memorabilia, including a Joe DiMaggio jersey, and has not turned over \u201ca single dollar from his nonexempt cash accounts.\u201d",
      "Giuliani said Monday that he was investigating what happened to the DiMaggio jersey and that he currently doesn\u2019t know where it is or who has it.",
      "Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the election workers, asked the judge to make inferences about what Giuliani had not turned over \u2014 such as the list of his doctors over the last four years \u2014 that would make it more likely the court would conclude that the Palm Beach property was not Giuliani\u2019s primary residence and thus is not protected from seizure.",
      "Joseph Cammarata, Giuliani\u2019s attorney, said reaching such a conclusion would be like a civil \u201cdeath penalty\u201d and would cause Giuliani to lose the Florida property even before a trial in mid-January, when the judge is supposed to hear testimony and view evidence before deciding the disposition of the condominium and World Series rings.",
      "Giuliani has insisted that the Palm Beach property is his personal residence now and should be shielded from the judgment.",
      "His lawyers have predicted that he will eventually win custody of the items on appeal."

      "As a member of that elite, informal club, Carter was uniquely positioned to do important work for his successors, whether Democrat or Republican. He achieved significant results at times, thanks to his public stature as a peacemaker, humanitarian and champion of democracy and his deep relationships with foreign leaders, troublemakers included.",
      "But with Carter, you never knew when he\u2019d go rogue. This was a man so self-confident, he described himself as \u201cprobably superior\u201d to the other ex-presidents who were still knocking about. Ornery about taking orders, he could be invaluable to the man in office, exasperating, or both at once.",
      "The others often bonded over \u201cwhat an annoying cuss Carter could be,\u201d Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy wrote in their book \u201cThe Presidents Club.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarter was the driven, self-righteous, impatient perfectionist who united the other club members around what seemed like an eternal question: was Jimmy Carter worth the trouble?\u201d",
      "He was, in the mind of Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College historian of religion and Carter\u2019s rise to the presidency. Balmer points to the violence averted in the last hours before a U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1994, when Carter, to the benefit of Democratic President Bill Clinton and countless lives saved, brokered a deal with Haiti\u2019s military coup leader to step aside and restore democracy.",
      "\u201cAny time you can avoid military conflict you score that as a win,\u201d Balmer said.",
      "Four years earlier, for the benefit of Republican President George H.W. Bush and the lives at stake in the region, Carter secured peace in Nicaragua at the brink of bloodshed when he persuaded the leftist leader Daniel Ortega to accept the electoral defeat that had so shocked the Sandinistas.",
      "John Danforth, former Republican senator from Missouri, joined Carter on missions to lay the groundwork for the 1990 Nicaragua election and then monitor it. In the first, the Carter entourage came upon Ortega's motorcade on a dusty road through the town of Rivas.",
      "The two men retired to the backyard of the nearest house for an impromptu negotiation over the government trucks Carter wanted Ortega to send around the country to deliver election material.",
      "\u201cOften when we envision former presidents, the picture is distant, even stuffy: men in dark suits and neckties captured in formal poses as though engaged in deep thoughts,\u201d Danforth wrote in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in February 2023. \"My picture of Carter is quite the contrary. He is in a back yard in Rivas. A crowing rooster is at his feet. An earnest expression is on his face. He\u2019s not talking statecraft; he\u2019s talking trucks.\u201d",
      "Yet he could infuriate those in power. Years after the U.S.-led Gulf War rolled back Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, it emerged that Carter had lobbied U.N. Security Council members and foreign leaders to reject the elder Bush\u2019s request to authorize the use of force.",
      "After being mostly sidelined by the man who defeated him in 1980, Ronald Reagan, Carter was given several missions by Bush until the Gulf War episode, after which he was cut off, Gibbs and Duffy write.",
      "His relationship with Clinton was limited and uneasy, bookended by Clinton\u2019s reluctance to call on a figure who symbolized humiliating election defeat for Democrats and by Carter\u2019s disapproval of Clinton\u2019s behavior outside his marriage.",
      "But after Clinton won the White House in 1992, he sent Carter to North Korea to take the measure of dictator Kim Il Sung. Clinton aides were livid when Carter went beyond his brief, engaging in an unauthorized negotiation with Kim and, what\u2019s more, talking about it on TV.",
      "But then, Carter was always a step apart from the rest. He was also one to wag a finger at the political establishment, if not to pulverize it like Donald Trump did.",
      "In January 2009, President George W. Bush invited other members of the presidents club to the White House for lunch and Oval Office photos. Bush, his father, Clinton and President-elect Barack Obama are seen clustered in front of the Resolute Desk. Carter is conspicuously off to the side \u2014 outlying.",
      "The images spoke volumes about Carter\u2019s place in the club, Balmer said. \u201cJimmy Carter didn\u2019t fit in with a lot of people. He was really an introvert, not somebody who warms up easily.\u201d",
      "If politics makes strange bedfellows, though, post-politics makes even stranger ones. The embedded hostilities of Democrat-versus-Republican can melt in the presidents club as former rivals become unlikely mates.",
      "Except with Trump. Regardless of party, the club members disdained Trump in his first term, and he had no use for them.",
      "When Carter turned 100 in October, Trump marked the occasion by declaring that Joe Biden is so bad a president that Carter must be \u201cthe happiest man because Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison.\u201d",
      "Trump was more sober in response to Carter's death, saying \u201cthe challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\u201d",
      "Democrat Lyndon Johnson leaned frequently on Republican predecessor Dwight Eisenhower, telling him \u201cYou\u2019re the best chief of staff I\u2019ve got.\u201d On the night of John Kennedy\u2019s assassination, LBJ sought Ike\u2019s advice on what to say to Congress, adding: \u201cI need you more than ever now.\u201d",
      "Reagan once pulled Clinton aside to tell him the military salute he was executing during the campaign was too lame for the presidency. He taught him how to make it snappy. Clinton in turn cherished his long and frequent phone calls with Richard Nixon, confiding in the disgraced but savvy Republican on foreign policy problems of the era.",
      "Clinton also became close to the Republican he vanquished in 1992, joining the elder Bush in Maine for golf, zippy boat rides and nights by the sea.",
      "More consequentially, the younger Bush asked his dad and Clinton to lead a fundraising mission for countries devastated by the 2004 tsunami, giving rise to a bipartisan pairing that pitched in on more endeavors, like Hurricane Katrina relief. \u201cI just loved him,\u201d Clinton said upon Bush\u2019s death in 2018.",
      "So, too, Obama and the younger Bush have teamed up on occasion and Bush enjoys an especially good-natured relationship with Michelle Obama.",
      "But the Jimmy-Jerry friendship was one for the ages.",
      "Carter took it as a point of pride when two historians, speaking separately at a commemoration of the 200th birthday of the White House, said his friendship with Ford was the most intensely personal between any two presidents in history.",
      "Carter said it began in 1981, when the two were sent by Reagan to represent the U.S. at the funeral of Anwar Sadat, the assassinated Egyptian leader. Nixon was on the trip, too, somewhat awkwardly. The other two took to each other, commiserating over how tough it could be to raise money for a presidential library when you\u2019ve been booted out of office.",
      "They were both Navy men, had three sons, a strong religious faith that Ford was quieter about than Carter, and independent spouses who bonded as well. \u201cThe four of us learned to love each other,\u201d Carter said.",
      "Carter and Ford spoke regularly, teamed up as co-leaders on dozens of projects and decided together which events they\u2019d attend and skip in tandem.",
      "\u201cWhen we were traveling somewhere in an automobile or airplane, we hated to reach our destination, because we enjoyed the private times that we had together,\u201d Carter said.",
      "That\u2019s what he told mourners in January 2007, at a service for Ford the month after he died at age 93.",
      "The Democrat and the Republican he so cherished had made a pact, one hard to imagine in this time of partisan poison: Whoever died first would be eulogized by the other."

Officers bragged about making up evidence and beating up suspects. They referred to women as water buffalo, shared photos of gorillas and freely used racial slurs.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minneapolis City Council is expected to decide Monday whether to approve an agreement with the federal government in response to the murder of George Floyd that would require major reforms within the city's police department under long-term court supervision.",
      "The agreement, known as a consent decree, has been under negotiation since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city's police in June 2023, alleging that they systematically discriminated against racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the safety of people in custody for years before Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis officer in 2020. Floyd's death prompted a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.",
      "The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used excessive force, including \u201cunjustified deadly force,\u201d and violated the rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech.",
      "As a result, the city and police department agreed to negotiate a deal with the federal agency to require changes overseen by an independent monitor and approved by a federal judge. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, several council members and police accountability activists all welcomed the prospect at the time as a move toward healing the city.",
      "Frey called a special City Council meeting for Monday \u201cfor the purpose of receiving a briefing on the litigation matter of U.S. Department of Justice v. City of Minneapolis and Minneapolis Police Department, including resolution possibilities.\u201d After a closed-door discussion that began Monday morning, the council was expected to reconvene in public in the afternoon for a vote.",
      "During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court approval.",
      "A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state agency issued its own blistering report in 2022.  The state investigation found that the city's police had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade.",
      "The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to high-profile deaths at the hands of police.",
      "It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville, Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor is waiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the beating death of Tyre Nichols.",
      "Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O\u2019Hara as police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and state consent decrees.",

      "The Federal Reserve\u2019s top financial regulator said Monday that he would resign next month, avoiding a potential confrontation with the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's top financial regulator said Monday that he would resign next month, avoiding a potential confrontation with the incoming Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate.",
      "Fed governor Michael Barr said in a letter to President Joe Biden that he would step down as vice chair for supervision Feb. 28, or earlier if a successor was confirmed. Yet Barr said he would remain on the Fed's board of governors. His term as governor lasts until 2032.",
      "Barr oversaw the proposal of tough new rules for the largest U.S. banks, which would have required them to significantly increase their financial reserves. The proposal sparked fierce opposition from the largest financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase, and was sharply criticized by Senate Republicans.",
      "During last year's presidential campaign, there were published reports that former president Donald Trump would try to fire or demote Barr. But at a press conference in November, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a president doesn't have the legal authority to do either one.",
      "Sen. Tim Scott, who is in line to chair the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the Fed, on Monday called Barr's proposed financial regulations \u201cdisastrous.\" He has previously said that they would limit lending by banks and weaken the economy.",
      "\u201cMichael Barr has failed to meet the responsibilities of his position,\u201d Scott said in a statement. \"I stand ready to work with President Trump to ensure we have responsible financial regulators at the helm.\u201d",
      "By stepping down as vice chair, but not governor, Barr has limited the Trump administration's options to replace him. All seven seats on the Fed's board of governors are filled, and an opening won't occur until Governor Adriana Kugler's term ends Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "As a result, for now President-elect Trump can only appoint another current governor to the top regulatory position, or wait until next year to fill the vacancy on the board with a new regulator. Governor Michelle Bowman, a Republican appointee, has publicly supported less stringent financial regulations and is a potential replacement.",
      "\u201cThe risk of a dispute over the position could be a distraction from our mission,\u201d Barr said in a statement from the Fed. \"In the current environment, I\u2019ve determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor.\u201d",
      "Barr took office in June 2022 and was later embroiled in the spate of bank failures in the spring of 2023 that started with Silicon Valley Bank, the third-largest failure in U.S. history. Barr oversaw the preparation of a report that blamed watered-down bank regulations, the Fed's own staffers, and the banks' managers for the failures.",
      "Barr then proposed to tighten bank rules, particularly for those banks with $100 billion or more in assets, by requiring them to hold more capital in reserve. Previously, Trump appointees at the Fed had loosed rules for banks with less than $250 billion in assets.",
      "Yet those rules met with ferocious opposition from the banking industry, prompting Powell to announce last March that they would be revised.",
      "The Fed said Monday that it \u201cdoes not intend to take up any major rulemakings until a vice chair for supervision successor is confirmed.\u201d"

      "Winter weather is causing flight delays and cancellations",
      "Winter weather often causes flight delays and cancellations. While airlines can\u2019t control the weather, they are required in the U.S. to provide refunds to customers whose flights are canceled. Here\u2019s what to know about your rights, and what to know when cancellations start piling up:",
      "When airlines expect bad weather to create problems for flights, they often give travelers a chance to postpone their trips by a few days without having to pay a fee. Search online for your airline's name and \u201ctravel alerts\u201d or similar phrases to look for possible rescheduling offers.",
      "It\u2019s better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than to be stranded in an airport terminal, so use the airline\u2019s app or flight websites to make sure that your flight is still on before heading to the airport. Airlines usually cancel flights hours or even days before departure time.",
      "If you\u2019re already at the airport, it\u2019s time to find another flight. Get in line to speak to a customer service representative, and call or go online to connect to the airline\u2019s reservations staff. It also helps to reach out on X, the site formerly known as Twitter.",
      "Most airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. That depends, however, on the availability of open seats. The good news for winter travelers is they stand a better chance of finding space in January than during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods, when passengers can wait days for a seat.",
      "You can, but airlines aren\u2019t required to put you on another carrier\u2019s flight. Some airlines, including the biggest ones except Southwest, say they can put you on a partner airline, but even then it\u2019s often hit or miss. Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com, has recommended researching alternate flights while you wait to talk to an agent.",
      "If you no longer want to take the trip, or found another way of getting to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money, even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. It doesn't matter why the flight was canceled.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t stick you with a voucher, you can get your money back,\u201d Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, told The Associated Press last year. \u201cThat means you have to cancel your entire reservation, but that could be an easy option for some travelers \u2014 especially if you wind up booking a flight on another carrier.\u201d",
      "You are also entitled to a refund of any bag fees, seat upgrades or other extras that you didn't get to use.",
      "U.S. airlines are not required to pay cash compensation and cover lodging and meals for passengers who are stranded, even if a flight cancellation is the airline's fault \u2014 such as the lack of a crew, a mechanical problem that grounds the plane, or a computer outage that brings the airline to a halt.",
      "The Biden administration said last month it was working on a proposal to change that. Such a rule would make U.S. policy more closely resemble airline consumer protections in Europe and go far beyond the current requirement for American airlines to issue ticket refunds.",
      "With just two weeks until President Joe Biden leaves office, the fate of additional regulations on airlines will be left in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "Each airline has its own policy. The U.S. Department of Transportation has a site that lets consumers see the commitments that each airline makes for refunds and covering other expenses when flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "If the weather forecast is troubling, consider booking a backup flight, says Potter, the Thrifty Traveler editor. Some airlines stand out as potential backups because they let customers get a full refund as long as they cancel within 24 hours of booking.",
      "If lots of flights are canceled, airline agents will soon be swamped. If you are in a group and one person belongs to a higher level of the airline\u2019s frequent-flyer program, use the number associated with that person to call the airline. You also can try calling your airline's international help number \u2014 usually available online \u2014 since those agents can make changes in your itinerary too.",
      "Be nice. The agent you're talking to is probably dealing with lots of other frustrated travelers too, and screaming at the agent won't make them want to help you. The cancellation isn't their fault."

      "WASHINGTON -- It's the largest prosecution in Justice Department history \u2014 with reams of evidence, harrowing videos and hundreds of convictions of the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Now Donald Trump's return to power has thrown into question the future of the more than 1,500 federal cases brought over the last four years.",
      "Jan. 6 trials, guilty pleas and sentencings have continued chugging along in Washington's federal court despite Trump's promise to pardon rioters, whom he has called \u201cpolitical prisoners\" and \u201chostages\u201d he contends were treated too harshly.",
      "Here's a look at where the prosecutions stand on the fourth anniversary of the Capitol riot and what could happen next:",
      "More than 1,500 people across the U.S. have been charged with federal crimes related to the deadly riot. Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were charged only with misdemeanor offenses for entering the Capitol illegally. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for beating police officers. Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump, a Republican, to Joe Biden, a Democrat.",
      "About 250 people have been convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial. Only two people were acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully acquitted a Capitol riot defendant. At least 1,020 others had pleaded guilty as of Jan. 1.",
      "More than 1,000 rioters have already been sentenced, with over 700 receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some combination of probation, community service, home detention or fines.",
      "The longest sentence, 22 years, went to former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy along with three lieutenants. A California man with a history of political violence got 20 years in prison for repeatedly attacking police with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons during the riot. And Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes is serving an 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy and other offenses.",
      "More than 100 Jan. 6 defendants are scheduled to stand trial in 2025, while at least 168 riot defendants are set to be sentenced this year.",
      "Authorities have continued making new arrests since Trump's election victory. That includes people accused of assaulting police officers who were defending the Capitol.",
      "Citing Trump's promise of pardons, several defendants have sought to have their cases delayed \u2014 with little success.",
      "In denying one such request, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, wrote: \"This Court recently had the occasion to discuss what effect the speculative possibility of a presidential pardon has on the timetable for a pending criminal matter. In short: little to none.\"",
      "One defendant who convinced a judge to postpone his trial, William Pope, told the court that the \u201cAmerican people gave President Trump a mandate to carry out the agenda he campaigned on, which includes ending the January 6 prosecutions and pardoning those who exercised First Amendment rights at the Capitol.\u201d Pope has now asked the judge to allow him to travel to Washington to attend Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump embraced the Jan. 6 rioters on the campaign trial, downplaying the violence that was broadcast on live TV and has been documented extensively through video, testimony and other evidence in the federal cases.",

      "President Joe Biden is heading to New Orleans as the city reels from the deadly New Year\u2019s attack in which an Army veteran plowed a truck into revelers, killing 14 and injuring 30 more",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is taking a message to the grieving families of victims in the deadly New Year's attack in New Orleans: \u201cIt takes time. You got to hang on.\u201d",
      "Biden on Monday will visit the city where an Army veteran drove a truck into revelers in the French Quarter, killing 14 and injuring 30 more. It's likely to be the last time Biden travels to the scene of a horrific crime as president to console families of victims. He has less than two weeks left in office.",
      "It's a grim task that presidents perform, though not every leader has embraced the role with such intimacy as the 82-year-old Biden, who has experienced a lot of personal tragedy in his own life. His first wife and baby daughter died in a car accident in the early 1970s, and his eldest son, Beau, died of cancer in 2015.",
      "\u201cI've been there. There\u2019s nothing you can really say to somebody that\u2019s just had such a tragic loss,\" Biden told reporters Sunday in a preview of his visit. \"My message is going to be personal if I get to get them alone.\u201d",
      "Biden often takes the opportunity at such bleak occasions to speak behind closed doors with the families, offer up his personal phone number in case people want to talk later on and talk about grief in stark, personal terms.",
      "The Democratic president will continue on to California following his stop in New Orleans. The White House was moving forward with plans for the trip even as a snowstorm was hitting the Washington region.",
      "In New Orleans, the driver plowed into a crowd on the city's famous Bourbon Street. Fourteen revelers were killed along with the driver. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who steered his speeding truck around a barricade and plowed into the crowd, later was fatally shot in a firefight with police.",
      "Jabbar, an American citizen from Texas, had posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the Islamic State militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the French Quarter.",
      "Biden on Sunday pushed back against conspiracy theories surrounding the attack, and he urged New Orleans residents to ignore them.",
      "\u201cI spent literally 17, 18 hours with the intelligence community from the time this happened to establish exactly what happened, to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that New Orleans was the act of a single man who acted alone,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this talk about conspiracies with other people, there\u2019s not evidence of that \u2014 zero.\u201d",
      "The youngest victim was 18 years old, and the oldest was 63. Most victims were in their 20s. They came from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, New York, New Jersey and Great Britain.",

      "\u201cThe best thing that the city, the state, and the federal government can do is do their best to make sure that this does not happen again. And what we can do as a people is to make sure that we don\u2019t live our lives in fear or in terror \u2014 but live our lives bravely and with liberty, and then support those families however they need support.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce will expand its Goodwood factory and global headquarters to meet the growing demand for bespoke models.",
      "It will invest more than \u00a3300 million so it can build more highly-customised versions of its cars for its super-rich clientele.",
      "The 120-year old British brand came under full control of German carmaker BMW in 2003 and officially opened the site in West Sussex the same year. Rolls Royce says this expansion secures its future in the UK.",
      "Rolls-Royce sold 5,712 cars in 2024, the third highest total in its history.",
      "While that number may seem tiny compared with the millions of cars delivered each year by mainstream manufacturers, Rolls-Royce operates in a highly rarefied market.",
      "The brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.",
      "In comparison, the average UK house price was \u00a3297,000 last year, according to Halifax.",
      "The price of bespoke models can vary widely. When it comes to the most elaborate creations, the final product can cost several times the base price of the car.",
      "There are relatively few buyers who can afford to pay so much for a car. Among those who can are celebrities, who often do not mind flaunting their wealth.",
      "Among them are US stars Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, as well as British rapper Stormzy who was banned from driving after being caught using a mobile phone behind the wheel of his Wraith in London.",
      "'Holographic paint and one-off artworks'",
      "For some customers, simply owning a Rolls-Royce isn't exclusive enough. In recent years, the company has increasingly focused on building highly-customised versions of its cars, which can then be sold at even higher prices.",
      "Rolls-Royce describes this strategy as \"creating value for clients through individualised products and experiences and providing opportunities for meaningful personal expression\".",
      "In practice, this has included cars with holographic paint, containing one-off artworks, or featuring intricate hand-stitched embroidery. One model, designed as a homage to the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, includes features made out of solid 18-carat gold.",
      "Rolls-Royce is not alone in this. Other high-end manufacturers such as Bentley, McLaren and Ferrari also offer detailed customisation.",
      "But making individually tailored cars, while profitable, is a labour-intensive process that requires time and space. At the same time, like other manufacturers the company is preparing for a future in which conventional cars will be phased out and replaced by electric models.",
      "Rolls-Royce said the extension of its factory would \"create additional space for the increasingly complex and high value bespoke and coachbuild projects sought by clients who define luxury as something deeply personal to them\".",
      "It added that the plan would \"also ready the manufacturing facility for the marque's transition to an all-battery electric vehicle future\".",
      "The carmaker has already been granted planning permission for the expansion of the Goodwood plant, which was built in 2003 and initially housed 300 workers. There are currently more than 2,500 people working on the site.",
      "\"This represents our most substantial financial commitment to Goodwood since its opening,\" said the Rolls Royce chief executive, Chris Brownridge.",
      "\"It is a significant vote of confidence in the Rolls-Royce marque, securing our future in the UK,\" he added.",
      "As a luxury carmaker focused on export markets, Rolls-Royce is insulated from many of the challenges currently facing the wider European motor industry. However, it has been affected by a fall in demand in China, one of its most important markets.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr Brownridge said rising demand for personalised vehicles was helping to offset that decline.",

      "Shoppers spent more in December compared with the year before but it wasn't enough to make up for an overall lacklustre year for retailers, new figures suggest.",
      "Doing particularly well over Christmas were gifts including beauty advent calendars, jewellery and AI-enabled tech, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.",
      "December's growth of 3.2% was boosted by a big weekend of Black Friday sales, which are normally included in November's figures.",
      "But with growth for the last three months of 2024 being only 0.4% higher than the previous year, it finishes a weak 12 months for retailers overall, and the BRC warned that 2025 would be \"challenging\" due to rising taxes and wage costs.",
      "Although many firms are yet to report on their performance over the Christmas period, the BRC said the new year would see retailers grapple with rising National Insurance Contributions, a higher National Living Wage, as well as new packaging levies.",
      "On Tuesday, High Street fashion chain Next said it would have to raise clothes prices to help offset an increase of \u00a373m in wage costs.",
      "Meanwhile, Barclays reported that consumer spending on debit and credit cards was flat in December. It said people were splashing out on entertainment and leisure but this was offset by cutbacks in some essential spending.",

      "Across the year, sales in 2024 were 0.7% higher than in 2023.",
      "The BRC said a last-minute bump in December sales came from Christmas shopping and the fact that Black Friday sale was included in the month's figures.",
      "\"Food sales fared better over the Christmas period, ticking up slightly from the previous year, meanwhile beauty products, jewellery and electricals made a strong showing under the tree this year,\" said the BRC's chief executive Helen Dickinson.",
      "Although slower than the year before, food sales increased over the year by 3.3%, and by a higher amount in December.",
      "Separate data from research firm Kantar said December was the busiest month for supermarkets since the pre-lockdown rush during the pandemic in 2020. It said that people were minding their budgets, with the sale of own-brand products growing.",
      "Budget supermarket Lidl said it had the most successful Christmas in its history, boosted by people buying festive food such as pigs in blankets and turkey.",
      "But the BRC's figures showed people spent less on other things - sales for non-food items over the year fell by 1.5%.",
      "Overall, the last three months of last year \"failed to give 2024 the send-off retailers were hoping for\", in a \"challenging year marked by weak consumer confidence and difficult economic conditions\", Ms Dickinson said.",

      "The two companies also alleged that Biden, who is entering the last weeks of his presidency, stopped Nippon Steel buying US Steel to pursue his own political agenda.",
      "In rejecting the proposed deal on Friday, President Biden said a strong domestically-owned steel industry was essential for national security and resilient supply chains, including for the car and defence industries.",
      "If the $14.9bn (\u00a311.8bn) takeover went ahead, it would strengthen Nippon's ability to compete with China, which produces 60% of the world's steel.",
      "The White House defended the decision, claiming that foreign ownership of US Steel presented a national security risk.",
      "The takeover has been in limbo since it was first announced in December 2023.",

      "They asked the court to order a new review, alleging that the process overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which has the power to vet foreign takeovers of US firms, had been \"manipulated\" to support Biden's stance.",
      "\"As a result of President Biden's undue influence to advance his political agenda, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US failed to conduct a good faith, national security-focused regulatory review process,\" claimed Nippon Steel and US Steel.",

      "They also reiterated that Nippon was prepared to invest $2.7bn in Pittsburgh-based US Steel.",

      "Since 1990, the US has blocked just eight foreign takeover deals - most in the last decade and involving firms from China.",
      "The lawsuit could leave the fate of the deal in the hands of the next administration, where some experts have said it could get a more favourable second hearing.",
      "But President-elect Donald Trump has also said he would block the deal. On Monday, he wrote on Truth Social: \"Why would they want to sell US Steel now when tariffs will make it a much more profitable and valuable company?\"",
      "Trump has said he plans to enact sweeping tariffs, which make imports into the US more expensive.",
      "He has said the measures, which he also deployed during his first term, will make it easier for US-based companies to compete with overseas rivals and spur a manufacturing boom, increasing demand for steel.",
      "According to economic analyses, the tariffs on foreign steel that he unveiled in 2018 led to modest job gains at steel-makers but job losses at other manufacturing companies that were forced to contend with higher steel costs."

      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",

      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",
      "The firm has hired German Marcus Dangelmaier, from global electronics company TE Connectivity to run Northvolt's operations in Skellefe\u00e5, from January, as it seeks to attract fresh investment.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "Born to a working class British-Jamaican family, he was a bright and happy kid, who grew up singing along to his mum's Motown records.",
      "His first true musical discovery was Coldplay's Yellow (\"it resonated with me, even though I didn't understand a word of it\") but Luton's social and cultural diversity meant he was exposed to hundreds of different genres.",
      "\"I went through a lot of stages,\" he says. \"I was a huge Green Day fan at one point. I even went through a bit of a Screamo phase.\"",

      "Released independently in 2023, it earned Smith his first UK chart hit and, subsequently, a deal with RCA Records.",
      "But he continued to build his audience organically, gigging constantly while posting on TikTok and YouTube.",
      "He's got an interesting take on social media. While artists like Halsey and Florence Welch have expressed frustration at record label pressure to create viral videos,  Smith calls TikTok a \"meritocratic system\" that rewards the effort you put in.",

      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",

    "story": [
      "Known to the world as The Vivienne, James Lee Williams was one of the biggest breakout stars of British drag, and it all started with an impression of Donald Trump in 2019 on the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race UK.",
      "Like many of the drag queens on the show, The Vivienne was unapologetically unique and hilariously straight-talking, but she also had something more: pizzazz.",
      "Described by judge Michelle Visage as \"the best Snatch Game character in the history of the show\", it was The Vivienne's President Trump impression - complete with pouted lips, orange makeup and a floppy blonde wig - in the Snatch Game that won her the show.",
      "That win consolidated The Vivienne's influence in the drag community and her career in the world of TV and musical theatre flourished.",
      "RuPaul's Drag Race UK star The Vivienne dies aged 32",
      "RuPaul's Drag Race UK star The Vivienne dies aged 32",
      "Bold, glitzy and saucy looks",
      "Giving one of the most memorable performances in the Snatch Game is no easy feat, but The Vivienne's highlights from the show go far beyond her Trump impression as she was responsible for some of the show's most iconic moments.",
      "Having adopted the drag name The Vivienne because of a love for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, her weekly outfits on the catwalk were second to none.",
      "On the show, she described her drag style as being \"like a Scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she's had to move back to Liverpool\".",
      "Without a contour line out of place and a perfected walk in stilettos, she wooed the judges with her bold, glitzy and saucy looks.",
      "Her 'Queen Elizabeth walking around Balmoral' outfit, which saw her wear a gold poncho and grey knitted skirt with fluffy ducks attached to it, was one of her most memorable.",
      "Combine that with her doing the floss dance in the outfit and she had viewers, fellow contestants and even RuPaul crying with laughter.",
      "In the final she was described by judge Graham Norton as having \"it all\". Fellow judge Alan Carr added that she had \"trademark wit\" and delivered a \"comedy masterclass\" with her impressions of Trump, Margret Thatcher and Kim Woodburn.",
      "The Vivienne went on to be a contestant in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2022.",
      "Skating to anthems by gay icons",
      "In January 2023, The Vivienne became the first drag queen to appear on Dancing on Ice and was partnered with American skater Colin Grafton.",
      "She finished in third place behind gymnast Nile Wilson and Joey Essex.",
      "The pair skated to songs by gay icons such as Dolly Parton and Cher and particularly excelled in the movies and musical weeks, whether performing to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious or Don't Cry for Me Argentina.",

      "The best Donald Trump impression you\u2019ll probably ever see",
      "Man sentenced for homophobic attack on The Vivienne",
      "Her jaw-dropping ability to skate perfectly from day one meant not only did she never appear in the bottom two, but she also never appeared lower than third on the leader board.",
      "But it was the week five performance that struck a chord with many as James chose not to perform in drag for the first time, confessing that it made him emotional dancing to Beyonce's Halo \"without my armour\".",
      "James was widely praised for their decision, with one person on X saying that \"'The Vivienne skating as James and not in drag in itself is inspiring\".",
      "Channelling the Wicked Witch of the West",
      "Williams starred in a number of theatre shows, most recently in a role that seemed to be the perfect fit - the misunderstood yet strong and compassionate Wicked Witch of the West in the revival of The Wizard of Oz musical.",
      "Starring alongside Aston Merrygold in the UK and Ireland tour, the performer reprised the role in the West End at the Gillian Lynne Theatre last year.",
      "\"I don't have many words to say as this is one huge dream,\" they wrote on Instagram. \"Dream big kids.\"",
      "The Vivienne channelled her Wicked Witch of the West role off-stage in November when she sent heads spinning in her emerald green sequined gown at the European premiere of the Wicked film.",
      "Most recently, she was performing as the Childcatcher on the tour of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and performed just a week ago in Blackpool.",
      "TV appearances",
      "While The Wizard of Oz was The Vivienne's first theatre role, she was no stranger to TV and was able to successfully build a career in television after RuPaul's Drag Race, appearing in a range of programmes including Hunted, Emmerdale and the Great British Sewing Bee.",
      "Over Christmas, The Vivienne appeared on a celebrity special of BBC's Blankety Blank.",
      "In 2020, the Vivienne starred in a six-part series The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood on BBC Three.",
      "The show saw the drag queen document her travels to Los Angeles in order to make a music video and was complete with her classic Northern humour and zingy one-liners.",
      "Not all drag race contestants and winners have been able to build such a successful brand around themselves despite their humour and flawless looks, which is testament to how The Vivienne's personality shone through in all her work."

      "And if that isn't enough romance for you then Zendaya has stolen the show with rumours of a potential engagement. Here's more on that and eight other highlights from the awards ceremony that you may have missed.",
      "1. Is Zendaya engaged?",
      "Zendaya brought her usual effortlessly sleek style to the red carpet but the internet seemed less interested in her burnt orange gown and more about what was on her finger.",
      "The Challengers star was sporting a large diamond ring on the fourth finger of her left hand and some thought it might be a sign that she's engaged.",
      "The 28-year-old has been dating Spider-Man actor Tom Holland for the past four years.",
      "Fans immediately started speculating about their possible engagement, but one pointed out on X: \"They're very protective about their relationship, so would she actually wear the ring on the red carpet?\"",
      "2. Nikki Glaser is a one-woman fashion show",
      "If you're hosting the Golden Globes, naturally you've got to look the part. For Nikki Glaser that meant a whopping a 10 dresses across the three hour ceremony.",

      "Turn the corner, bam - Melissa McCarthy. Turn another - Jean Smart and the rest of the cast of Hacks.",

      "Some hunted for drinks, others were wrangled by publicists to interviews and photo shoots with eager journalists.",
      "Roaming around the hotel, Selena Gomez, hot off her film Emilia P\u00e9rez winning four awards, was seen with her new fianc\u00e9 Benny Blanco. He kissed her shoulder as he trailed behind her in an intimate moment.",
      "4. A message to Japanese actors",
      "Sh\u014dgun, a series set in 17th century Japan, was a big winner at the Globes, taking home four awards.",
      "Star Hiroyuki Sanada won best male actor in a drama TV series and backstage told the BBC that he hopes the show and their wins could \"could break the wall of language\" and open \"doors much wider\" not only for Japanese actors and projects but those across the globe.",
      "His co-star Tadanobu Asano won best male supporting actor in a TV series and clearly shocked, jumped out of his seat and, in Japanese custom, bowed repeatedly - first to those at his table then everyone in the audience and then to the cameras, which had panned to him.",
      "\"Wow!\" he said when handed the award on stage. He acknowledged that he's a new talent in the US and started off by introducing himself to the crowd.",
      "\"Maybe you don't know me, so I'm an actor from Japan and my name is Tadanobu Asano,\" he said as the crowd laughed.",
      "\"I'm very happy!\" he shouted through excited laughter, concluding his acceptance speech.",
      "Backstage, he said his message to other Japanese actors: \"If I can do this, anyone can.\"",
      "5. Colin Farrell has fond memories of Andrew Scott",
      "Irish actor Colin Farrell picked up his third Golden Globe, for playing the Batman villain in the HBO series Penguin.",
      "Accepting his speech he mentioned some of the other nominees in his category including fellow Irishman Andrew Scott.",
      "He recalled their first movie together, Drinking Crude, and said: \"[Andrew] who I did my first film with 25, 30 years ago. You can't even find it on Betamax. It doesn't exist. But we go back that far.\"",
      "He added to Scottish actor Richard Gadd, whose experience of stalking and sexual assault inspired the Netflix hit series Baby Reindeer, that \"you broke my heart with your work this year\".",
      "In his speech, Farrell also spoke about the three hours it took to be fitted with prosthetics to make him the bloated villain in Penguin.",
      "\"In the morning, I drank black coffee, listened to 80s music, and I became a canvas for that team's brilliance.\"",
      "Farrell also said: \"Thank you for employing me. And yeah, I guess it's prosthetics from here on out.\"",
      "Backstage, Mr Farrell acknowledged his lengthy Hollywood career and said despite his win, \"I certainly don't consider myself at the top of any pile\".",

      "\"People have been calling me Zaddy but I don't know what that means,\" Goldblum said while Yeoh added that she was just as confused by people telling her that she's been \"serving mother\".",
      "Despite being clueless to the meaning of the Gen Z language and looking even more baffled as Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande tried to explain the meaning behind these words, they both said they love it.",
      "\"Let's see who ate,\" Goldblum said as he introduced the nominees for a category.",
      "Backstage the cast of Wicked spoke to the BBC about whether there was a future for the Land of Oz in a TV series.",
      "The film's producer Marc Platt joked that the film \"is already a show\" - on Broadway. Beyond that, though, he said: \"It's hard to predict.\"",

      "She was asked about the celebrations happening back in her home country of Brazil, with one reporter remarking that it was like she'd won the country the World Cup.",
      "\"It is something very patriotic that's happening in Brazil with this film,\" she said, noting the country was \"very happy\" thanks to the Golden Globes.",

      "She said the award reflected the message of the film, a body horror about a woman who trades her body for a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "\"I'll just leave you with one thing that I think this movie is imparting is in those moments when we don't think we're smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough, or basically just not enough,\" Moore said.",
      "\"I had a woman say to me, just know you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.",
      "After winning her award, she told journalists backstage about how many women spend much of their lives as caretakers and don't get to spend their energy outward. And now, at 62, she is and \"it feels really damn good\".",
      "Jodie Foster, who is the same age as Moore, won the award for best actress in a limited series and said the 60s are a \"golden age\" because there's like \"a hormone that happens when suddenly you go, 'Oh, I don't really care about all the stupid things anymore\".",

    "story": [
      "One of the UK's most promising new guitar bands, English Teacher, have kicked off the countdown of the top five on the BBC's annual list of music's rising stars.",
      "The Leeds quartet have been voted in fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound of 2025 poll \u2013 with a panel of 180 music industry experts choosing them as one of the acts with \"the best chance of mainstream success\" in the next 12 months.",
      "They got well on their way last year. In September, the band beat pop stars like Charli XCX and CMAT to win the Mercury Prize for their debut album, This Could Be Texas.",
      "The record deals in sharp portraits of life in sleepy northern towns, where the background hum of racism, loneliness and deprivation is thrown into sharp relief by sublime scenery and lifelong friendships.",
      "Their music, meanwhile, is constantly surprising \u2013 full of shifting time signatures, needle-point guitar riffs and soaring melodies that are simultaneously odd and captivating.",
      "\"We never really set out with an aim to create something specific,\" says guitarist Lewis Whiting. \"But, that's the fun part, right? Trying to make something new and interesting.\"",
      "Chappell Roan and Ezra Collective on BBC Sound of 2025 list",
      "Find out all about BBC Sound of 2025",
      "Indie band English Teacher win Mercury Prize",
      "They say the acclaim they've received so far still doesn't feel real. \"Where we come from, this just doesn't happen,\" says frontwoman Lily Fontaine.",
      "\"I keep telling people that I feel like I'm living in a simulation.\"",
      "\"It does feel dream-like,\" adds Whiting.",
      "\"Best year of my life, craziest year of my life.\"",
      "Over the last 12 months, the group have played more than 100 gigs in 16 countries, rising steadily up festival bills as they go, and surviving on \"willpower, laughter and Red Bull\".",
      "Along the way, they told journalists their origin story more times than they care to count. Eventually, they got tired of the \"boring\" reality (they met studying music at Leeds Conservatoire) and started inventing less prosaic stories.",
      "\"We said we were distant relatives who met at a wedding 20 years ago in Leeds,\" laughs Fontaine.",
      "\"They put us at the odd table. We were sort of like the outcasts,\" adds Whiting, continuing the story.",
      "\"But we really clicked,\" says Fontaine. \"We started talking about Shakira and how we wanted to be like her, then they played Hips Don't Lie at the disco and we said, 'We should start a band'.\"",
      "English Teacher, it should be noted, sound nothing like Shakira. They started out as a dream-pop outfit called Frank and, after the addition of Whiting on guitar, began to lean into a more angular, post-punk sound.",
      "Key references include Radiohead, Sonic Youth and Pavement. \"But, famously, we don't agree on our favourite bands,\" says Whiting.",
      "One of their first releases was a demo of The World's Biggest Paving Slab, which they put out independently in 2020.",
      "Like many of their songs, it draws inspiration from Fontaine's hometown of Colne in Lancashire, where the titular paving stone resides outside the town hall.",
      "The lyrics reference a host of local heroes \u2013 from Life On Mars actor John Simm to novelist Charlotte Bronte \u2013 juxtaposing the colour and vigour of the town's history against the social problems it faces in the current day.",
      "It's an itch she continues to scratch throughout the band's catalogue, addressing social deprivation and political mismanagement (\"Can the river stop its banks from bursting? / Blame the council, not the rain\") alongside themes of identity, self-doubt and emotional turbulence.",
      "Incredibly, she only started writing relatively recently. As a teenager, she'd been in a wedding band with her friend, playing Amy Winehouse and Adele covers. She didn't consider composing until she applied for university.",
      "\"I wrote my first song for the audition,\" she recalls. \"It was awful, but it worked. I got a place to study singing and performance, but I very quickly switched to composition, because I was suddenly spending all my time writing songs.\"",
      "Defying convention",
      "During that period, English Teacher's members \u2013 completed by drummer Douglas Frost and bassist Nicholas Eden \u2013 circled each other on Leeds' live music scene, playing with various other bands before settling on their current line-up.",
      "Their breakthrough came with 2021's R&B, their official debut single, where Fontaine addresses the challenge of being a woman of colour fronting an indie band: (\"Despite appearances, I haven't got the voice for R&B\").",
      "It's a perception she struggled with herself as a teenager, frustrated that she wasn't capable of \"the kind of the vocal runs that the black singers I looked up to were able to do\".",
      "As a frontwoman, she developed her own style \u2013 a droll mixture of sprechgesang and her fluttering, airy upper register. But she still encountered prejudice.",
      "\"There'd be times where I told people that I made music, and they'd give a certain expression when I said that it was guitar music or it was indie music,\" she says.",
      "\"There were a lot of small comments after gigs. People would come up and say, 'Oh, that's not what I was expecting at all',\" adds Whiting.",
      "Fontaine is careful not to make too big an issue of it. \"I think I've got a lot of privilege, because I'm quite a light skinned woman of colour,\" she says.",
      "\"I think if I was dark skinned it would be even harder - but it did affect me, not seeing people who looked like me in bands.",
      "\"I think it made me start a band later in life. Maybe I would have started when I was a teenager, and not when I was leaving university.\"",
      "English Teacher's early songs gained an audience during the first wave of the Covid pandemic \u2013 which meant they didn't get to play a gig together until the lockdown ended.",
      "Their first show was as part of an all-day mini festival in May 2021, where the audience still had to be seated and socially distanced.",
      "\"Those first gigs were kind of jarring,\" Whiting recalls. \"It was quite strange because everything up 'til then felt very online, which doesn't feel as tangible. And then when you go and play a gig, it's like, 'Yeah, this is actually going somewhere.'\"",
      "\"We were so nervous, too,\" says Fontaine. \"I feel like it was only late into 2023 that we really found our confidence.\"",
      "By that point, they were deep into recording their debut album with Italian producer Marta Salogni (Bjork, Depeche Mode, MIA) \u2013 including new, more polished versions of R&B and The World's Biggest Paving Slab.",
      "The band say they put \"immense pressure\" on themselves to perfect the record, fixating on its push-pull dynamics, adding extra layers of context, and experimenting with new instruments.",
      "\"It was an intense time in our personal lives, trying to get it finished and out. We gave a lot to it,\" says Whiting.",
      "\"Recording your first album is just a huge opportunity,\" continues Fontaine. \"I think we were very aware of that.\"",
      "The hard work paid off.",
      "Record Collector Magazine called This Could Be Texas \"one of the most confident and charismatic debuts in years\". The Mercury Prize judges said the band's \"winning lyrical mix of surrealism and social observation... displays a fresh approach to the traditional guitar band format\".",
      "The quartet are endearingly amazed that anyone paid attention at all.",
      "\"I wasn't sure that it would connect with people, because the lyrics are quite specific to the area I grew up in,\" says Fontaine.",
      "Instead, it was the bigger themes \u2013 of leaving home and finding your place in a world that's \"going up in flames\" \u2013 that helped them find an ever-growing audience.",
      "On The World's Biggest Paving Slab, Fontaine mockingly describes herself as \"the world's smallest celebrity\" \u2013 a lyric that's rapidly becoming obsolete.",
      "\"I'm not the smallest, but certainly not the biggest,\" she laughs.",
      "\"In the alphabet of celebrity, I'm probably on the X-list.\"",

    "summary": "Being the UK's new City of Culture is a chance for Bradford to challenge prejudices against the city.",
    "story": [
      "As Bradford begins its year as UK City of Culture, it is not just trying to show a different face to the rest of the country - it's also hoping to win over doubters in the city.",
      "One of the first productions is a radio play written by broadcaster Nick Ahad, and its theme is Bradford's battered reputation.",
      "\"The working title for this play was 'Bradford, City of Culture?!' because we knew that's what the reaction would be when people found out we would be the City of Culture for 2025,\" he explains.",
      "Ahad eventually settled on the excellent title Bilal and Ted's Bradfordian Adventure, and it's on BBC Sounds. One of the actors is Seeta Wrightson, a comedian from the city.",
      "\"I think it's really unfairly got a bad rep. And I think that's because in the news or on social media, people don't want to talk about good things.\"",
      "'Why is Bradford so\u2026?'",
      "Wrightson's not wrong.",
      "The headlines about Bradford are often brutal. In recent months, news stories have declared it Britain's gloomiest city (because it has the least sunshine) and the second most miserable place to live.",
      "Type the words \"Why is Bradford so\u2026.?\" into a search engine and see what happens.  The odds are you will probably get the following autofill options - \"bad\", \"dangerous\" and \"poor\".",
      "And it's not just the opinions of people outside the city. Dr Paul Sullivan of Bradford University has carried out research into the stigma. His hometown is Ireland's Cork, a place where its comedians make fun of its high opinion of itself. Bradford, he discovered, was rather different.",
      "\"What surprised me was... the almost lack of civic pride.",
      "\"Even reading the local newspaper, some of the headlines can be very upbeat, and beneath it are just loads of comments that, 'This is a disaster, it'll just never work, Bradford is doomed'.\"",
      "But Dr Sullivan is a fan.",
      "\"I love the city. I fell in love with Bradford straight away. I love the city centre, the beautiful countryside.  And it was really quite a surprise to me to see that level of negativity.\"",
      "Much of it, he believes, is rooted in an external and almost \"ideological hostility\" to the city's ethnic diversity.",
      "\"I think there's a reluctance to admit that Bradford can succeed. A desire for Bradford to fail.\"",
      "However, in the face of this antagonism, something is, he feels, developing.",
      "In his recent interviews with residents, \"there was a real sense of pride, in their sense of belonging\".",
      "It was a topic Ahad and Wrightson also raised. Diversity has become utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I'm Bangladeshi and English. My wife's Pakistani and Indian, and you sort of don't have to explain here,\" says Ahad.",
      "\"Like 100%,\" Wrightson adds. \"I'm mixed heritage, my mum's Indian, my dad's English. And growing up, it wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "City of Culture has for many become a moment to look beyond the problems and champion what's growing out of its diversity.",
      "People feel welcomed",
      "Natalie Davies, an actor and writer from Bradford, is creating a play about the city's nightlife.",
      "\"The stigma that's been attached for years is old now, and that's not what Bradford is.",
      "\"I'm very lucky. I've worked in television, I've worked in film, I've worked in theatre and radio, and every time I go on to a set, I always champion Bradford.",
      "\"This is actually a great place, and the thing about it is anybody from anywhere could come to Bradford and feel like they belong and we hold that. People come and completely feel welcomed.",
      "\"It's beautiful.\"",
      "City of Culture has also been a chance for people to take stock of Bradford's cultural history and the famous names that have come from here.",
      "Among them are artist David Hockney, playwright JB Priestley, composer Delius and the Bronte sisters.",
      "\"Emily Bronte, you just take it for granted that she's from Bradford,\" says Wrightson.",
      "For her, City of Culture has been a moment to look at what makes the city special.  And again and again, talking to younger Bradfordians, while some might mention the Brontes, the spectacular Victorian architecture, the first free school meals or the diversity - almost everyone seems to agree that the city's food is key.",
      "Of course, no two people ever seem to agree as to where you can get the best curry, but perhaps one of the best known restaurants is Akbar's, famous for the creation of the giant hanging naan.",
      "Created to save space on a table, the family naan grew to a size that has defeated even the largest Yorkshire appetite.",
      "\"People have tried. None have succeeded,\" says Samad Iqbal, who started working at Akbar's aged 15 and is a proud ambassador for a city that describes itself as the Capital of Curry.",
      "\"Some people call it elephant ears. Some people call it a Christmas tree. But this family naan has gone worldwide.",
      "\"I am very proud of Bradford, I'm born and bred here. It's a fantastic place to live, a fantastic place to eat. It's places like this which show the true spirit of Bradford.\"",
      "It appears Bradford 2025 has already begun to have an effect. It has, says Dr Sullivan, encouraged people to talk positively about the city.",
      "\"In the last couple of years we have seen a change. I am speaking from opinion here now rather than research, but I think we have seen a shift towards civic pride, and I think the catalyst for that really coming to fruition will be Bradford 2025.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:46:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The show has returned to our screens for a third series, but with a few key changes to the format.",
    "story": [
      "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.",
      "The Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy.",
      "\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\"",
      "Wednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier.",
      "But although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.",
      "\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"",
      "The presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes.",
      "\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"",
      "The Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million.",
      "A true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.",
      "Format changes",
      "Several tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.",
      "One early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness.",
      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",
      "\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"",
      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:45:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Pictures from China, where cases of the virus are surging, have people worried on social media.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, scenes of hospitals in China overrun with masked people have made their rounds on social media, sparking worries of another pandemic.",
      "Beijing has since acknowledged a surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV), especially among children, and it attributed this to a seasonal spike.",
      "But HMPV is not like Covid-19, public health experts have said, noting that the virus has been around for decades, with almost every child being infected by their fifth birthday.",
      "However, in some very young children and people with weakened immune systems, it can cause more serious illness. Here is what you need to know.",
      "What is HMPV and how does it spread?",
      "HMPV is a virus that will lead to a mild upper respiratory tract infection - practically indistinguishable from flu - for most people.",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, the virus spreads through direct contact between people or when someone touches surfaces contaminated with it.",
      "Symptoms for most people include cough, fever and nasal congestion.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus, along with those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, says Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases physician in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" among the immunocompromised will develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring - some experts say this is because the viruses survive better in the cold and they pass more easily from one person to another as people stay indoors more often.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "In fact many countries in the northern hemisphere, including but not limited to China, are experiencing an increased prevalence of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",
      "Data from health authorities in the US and UK shows that these countries, too, have been experiencing a spike in HMPV cases since October last year.",
      "Is HMPV like Covid-19? How worried should we be?",
      "Fears of a Covid-19 style pandemic are overblown, the experts said, noting that pandemics are typically caused by novel pathogens, which is not the case for HMPV.",
      "HMPV is globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" says Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",
      "\"So overall, I don't think there is currently any signs of a more serious global issue.\"",
      "Still, Dr Hsu advises standard general precautions such as wearing a mask in crowded places, avoiding crowds where possible if one is at higher risk of more severe illness from respiratory virus infections, practising good hand hygiene, and getting the flu vaccine."

    "summary": "Sussex Police began with an initial 105 cases, but the BBC understands there are now more than 200.",
    "story": [
      "A police investigation into allegations of preventable deaths and injuries at an NHS trust has doubled the number of cases it is looking at, BBC News can reveal.",
      "The claims centre on care and treatment provided by University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust between 2015 and 2021.",
      "Sussex Police started looking in 2023 into an initial 105 cases, but BBC File On 4 Investigates has learned that number is now more than 200.",
      "The force says the investigation is \"active and ongoing\", but it will \"not be providing specific details around case numbers at this time\".",
      "Police became involved after two whistleblowers raised allegations of medical negligence at two of the trust's departments - neurosurgery and general surgery, including concerns about at least 40 deaths.",
      "The increase in cases is linked to more families having contacted the police.",
      "Separate to this investigation, we have spoken to the family of a patient who allege they were \"lied\" to by a senior surgeon in the trust's general surgery department, before he carried out an operation that left her with life-threatening injuries.",
      "Wendy Gibbs, 80, had been due to be operated on by Marc Lamah to repair a pelvic prolapse at a private hospital in Brighton, run by Nuffield Health. But the surgeon told her he wanted to switch the procedure to a different Nuffield hospital because the Brighton site didn't have a specific type of scanner that he would need. The machine, it turned out, was also not available at the second hospital.",
      "Mr Lamah also failed to disclose to Mrs Gibbs that he, and other surgeons, were prevented from carrying out such operations in Brighton at the time, as Nuffield Health had suspended that type of surgery over safety concerns.",
      "When Mrs Gibbs' operation happened in March 2024, Mr Lamah mistakenly snipped her bowel, causing internal bleeding not spotted for hours. Mrs Gibbs developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition.",
      "She needed an emergency second operation - also carried out by Mr Lamah - at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, which is part of the NHS trust under investigation. This was followed by a spell in intensive care and 11 days' sedation.",
      "Mrs Gibbs, who now has a permanent stoma bag, says she was traumatised by the experience. \"He failed me, he betrayed my trust. I've got numerous issues left from the operation. Most of my hair fell out. My nails fell off. It's coming back now, but the trauma of it actually happening and not being able to do anything about it - it's not easy.\"",
      "Wendy Gibbs's case is not part of the police investigation as her treatment occurred after the period the police are looking at.",
      "Nuffield Health - the private healthcare provider at whose hospital the first operation took place - said it was conducting a \"deeper investigation into a particular consultant.\"",
      "It added: \"As the investigation is still live, we are unable to comment.\"",
      "However, a former director of clinical services at Nuffield's Brighton hospital - where Mr Lamah also practised privately - said that in 2023, the company had recognised concerns with his complication rate.",
      "Michael Turner told us data showed that one third of Mr Lamah's patients had experienced a \"moderate harm event\" (where, for instance, a patient had to be transferred to another hospital or re-admitted) over a 12-month period. Mr Turner said the figure should have been less than 5%.",
      "Three months ago, Michael Turner was dismissed by Nuffield Health for gross misconduct after he used an expletive to describe the actions of a different consultant.",
      "Surgeon 'set himself 45-min limit'",
      "Mr Lamah continues to operate at Royal Sussex County Hospital. The University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust told us it had audited his NHS data, which showed that his outcomes were within the expected national range.",
      "\"If there is any evidence of concerns regarding the care of our NHS patients, then of course we do not hesitate to act,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Speaking anonymously, a former NHS colleague of Mr Lamah told the BBC that the surgeon had been \"pulled up on a few occasions for things that were significantly unprofessional\".",
      "The colleague says that one of these occasions related to an emergency operation, when Mr Lamah announced he was setting himself a challenge to finish in 45 minutes, despite there being no need to do so.",
      "We contacted Marc Lamah, but he refused to comment.",
      "The BBC has reported a number of stories from the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust in the past two years:",

      "The trust lost a nine-month legal battle with the BBC and The Times to block access to and redact documents in two employment tribunal cases",
      "Police officers are currently identifying relevant cases and sending them to medical experts for their view as to whether there is a basis to question the care these patients received - a process that's expected to finish in early 2025. The investigation is at an early stage and there are no suspects at this stage.",
      "The majority of cases appear to involve the neurosurgery department.  Police are considering gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges.",
      "File on 4 Investigates understands that one of the cases being examined by medical experts as part of the police investigation is that of Stephen Coles. He was operated on by a neurosurgeon named Carl Hardwidge, who spent 31 years working at the trust before leaving in 2023. He has been criticised by the family of Mr Coles, who died in 2021 after being operated on by Mr Hardwidge to remove a brain tumour.",
      "Following the surgery, Mr Coles, who was 66, was unable to swallow due to cranial nerve damage. He then spent several weeks in hospital where he eventually died, after contracting pneumonia from poor care he received on a general ward.",
      "His sister, Julie Rhodes, says Mr Hardwidge has never explained to the family why Mr Coles was so ill after his operation. An inquest did not raise any concerns about the care Mr Coles received, a conclusion that left Ms Rhodes \"dissatisfied\" as it \"didn't answer any questions.\"",
      "However, a neurological expert who assessed the case for BBC News said Stephen Coles' death had been avoidable, and criticised Mr Hardwidge's post-operative care. He said Mr Coles should have been fitted with a tracheostomy to help him breathe.",
      "\"The responsibility for protecting the patient's airway,\" said the expert, \"must lie with the operating surgeon.\"",
      "File on 4 Investigates is aware concerns have been raised about care Carl Hardwidge provided to at least three other patients while working at the trust.",
      "A judge at an employment tribunal also said he was \"somewhat concerned\" Mr Hardwidge had, during his evidence, tried to minimise delays in the care of another patient who died in 2012.",
      "When File on 4 Investigates contacted Mr Hardwidge, he refused to comment.",
      "The University Hospitals Sussex NHS trust said that its neurosurgery team had faced significant challenges since 2012, and that consequently some patients were waiting longer for their care than they should have done, \"for which we sincerely apologise\".",
      "The trust says it is cooperating with the police investigation and recognise that it has  much work to do to improve their performance. In a statement, the chief executive, George Findlay, said that since a new leadership team was installed in 2017, many improvements in quality and safety had followed.",
      "\"Despite these and other improvements,\" added Mr Findlay, \"it is clear that some long-standing challenges remain, and it is also absolutely clear that we have much further to go in improving care and better supporting colleagues.\""

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "summary": "The challenge involves forgoing alcohol and unhealthy food for 75 days and doing multiple daily workouts.",
    "story": [
      "When you think of new year's resolutions, a 75-day workout might not top the list.",
      "But that's what's going viral this year as people take to TikTok to document their progress.",
      "First, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol.",
      "Plus on each of the 75 days, you do two 45-minute workouts, one of them outside, drink more than three litres of water and read 10 pages of a non-fiction book.",
      "Easy, right? Well in case you fancy your chances, two people who have finished the challenge told us what it's really like - and experts have cautioned that if it sounds a bit strict, something more relaxed might work better for you.",
      "'New areas for me to tackle'",
      "Meet 29-year-old Devamsha Gunput, who completed 75 Hard last March whilst working full-time as a digital consultant for a large corporation.",
      "\"It was definitely hard,\" she tells the BBC. \"Also living in Edinburgh, it was dark, wet and cold and you had to do one of the workouts outside.\"",
      "Devamsha says one of the most challenging aspects of 75 Hard was \"setting boundaries\" when visiting her South Asian family so that she could be strict with her diet.",
      "\"Having to exercise twice a day and be strict on my diet were really uncomfortable and new areas for me to tackle, because I hadn't had that conversation before,\" she says.",
      "But since completing the challenge, she's noticing the lasting impacts so far.",
      "\"I exercise a lot more regularly, my reading habits and my relationship with food have transformed,\" she says.",
      "While 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella.",
      "He said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan.",
      "He is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich.",
      "More relaxed variations of the challenge have been popping up on social media recently, called 75 Soft and 75 Medium, in which participants can have the odd alcoholic drink and unhealthy meal while still doing exercise and reading.",
      "'My family and friends were blown away'",
      "Sophie Deakins, 27, also completed 75 Hard last year while working as an assistant manager at a London cinema.",
      "She says she undertook the challenge after struggling \"with discipline and consistency\" with other plans.",
      "She overhauled her diet, cutting out chocolate and sweets but allowing for anything with naturally occurring sugar, like fruit and honey.",
      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",
      "Since completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\".",
      "\"But the biggest thing is probably a mindset shift - the encouragement I got from knowing I can do it, the excuses about time and self-doubt are all gone,\" she says.",
      "Pros and cons of the challenge",
      "But the challenge isn't for everyone, which is something strength and conditioning coach Tana von Zitzewitz wants those who are considering it to bear in mind.",
      "\"You need a lot of time, not only for the workouts, but for reading the book - it seems a lot to try and cram into one day,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.",
      "Another aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.",
      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",
      "From a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.",
      "NHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.",
      "He also says that it would need to be compared to a more basic regime, to see if that could achieve the same results.",
      "\"If it's a way for people to get out and be active then I am all for it, but if it's a question of whether this is better than going to the gym three times a week or going for a run once a week and eating healthily, then I am not sure,\" he adds.",
      "Hitting certain criteria isn't the intention of 75 Hard's founder, Mr Frisella. He doesn't set any rules that involve losing a certain amount of weight, for example.",
      "While the challenge encourages people to take progress pictures each day, much of the TikTok content around it focuses on how the person feels at the end rather than how they look, helping to avoid unhealthy fixations with appearance.",
      "Dr Whiteman recommends visiting the NHS Live Well website, which has tips on what constitutes a healthy weight, diet and exercise regime, along with mental health and sleep advice.",

      "The tech billionaire and adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump labelled Phillips a \"rape genocide apologist\" and said she should be jailed.",
      "Asked if the threat to her own safety had gone up since his social media posts and whether protections were in place, Phillips replied \"yes\".",
      "She said the experience had been \"very, very, very tiring\" but that she was \"resigned to the lot in life that you get as a woman who fights violence against women and girls\".",

      "Starmer attacks those 'spreading lies' on grooming gangs",
      "She added: \"I'm no stranger to people who don't know what they're talking about trying to silence women like me.\"",
      "The row between Mr Musk and the UK government concerns cases of groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - being convicted for sexually abusing and raping predominantly white girls around the UK.",
      "Mr Musk's intervention came in response to Phillips rejecting a request for the government to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham - which sparked calls from the Conservatives and Reform UK for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.",
      "Phillips decision was taken in October but first reported by GB News at the start of the year, and then picked up by Mr Musk on his social media platform X.",
      "Phillips defended the government's decision not to hold a national inquiry, arguing that local inquiries, such as one held in Telford, were more effective at leading to change.",
      "\"What I saw happen in Telford is the exact opposite of what I have seen happen because of the national expert inquiry for the last two years since it came out - I saw change happen,\" she said.",
      "She said she would be getting council leaders together to learn the lessons from Telford.",
      "\"When people say it's the council marking their own homework, it isn't.",
      "\"It is an independent inquiry led locally and it's the only model I've seen work, and I've worked in this field for 15 years.\"",
      "The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which lasted seven years and reported in 2022, made 20 recommendations - however, none has yet been implemented.",
      "Speaking to the Today programme earlier Prof Alexis Jay, who led the inquiry, said: \"We've had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions... we have set out what action is required and people should just get on with it locally and nationally.\"",
      "However, Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick argued that a new national inquiry was needed, saying: \"We now know so much more.\"",
      "He added: \"The Jay review looked at six towns. We now suspect that at least 50 towns have had grooming gangs of this kind.",
      "\"We can try to prevent other vulnerable young girls from being in this position again, and the frankly cowardly officials and councillors who have covered this up can also be brought to justice.\"",
      "The Conservatives have said they will try to add an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill calling for ministers to establish a \"national statutory inquiry into historical child sexual exploitation, focused on grooming gangs\".",
      "The Labour government has a big majority in the House of Commons and therefore the amendment, which if approved would kill the bill, is unlikely to pass.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said MPs should not be voting down a bill which includes measures for safeguarding children.",
      "Speaking to The Mirror, Sir Keir said: \"It's shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It's the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children.\"",
      "But shadow education minister Neil O'Brien claimed the government was \"blocking a full national inquiry\", adding: \"Labour MPs now have a first chance to vote to give victims answers and justice, and pass an amendment that will make clear that the will of Parliament is for a national inquiry.\"",
      "Asked about her reaction to Mr Musk's comments about her personally, Phillips said his remarks were \"ridiculous\".",
      "She said the criticism she was currently facing would be \"worth it... only if we make an actual change\".",
      "\"And if I have to go through all of this and I haven't changed the way local areas deal with grooming gangs in two years' time, it wouldn't have been worth it,\" she added.",
      "She said suggestions Labour politicians worried inquiries would be unpopular with their own voters was \"an absolute load of rubbish\".",
      "Phillips, who ran a domestic abuse refuge before becoming a Labour MP,  also strongly defended her own record on tackling violence against women.",
      "\"I've worked in this field for years. I have met with, I have supported, for a number of years, girls who are still being groomed.",
      "\"I've travelled across the country in the middle of the night, something that I very much doubt that [Conservative leader] Kemi Badenoch or [shadow home secretary] Chris Philp have done to get a young woman, literally while she was bleeding from a battering\u2026 to take her to a place of safety.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Las Vegas on Tuesday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino defended Mr Musk's comments, saying: \"If not for X, where would the conversation be to save thousands of girls, to bring people to justice who must be brought to justice?",
      "\"Those grooming trials would have stayed silent, and now we're looking at an inquiry. So I look at the bravery and the vision courage to do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper set out actions she was taking to implement the recommendations of the Jay review, including criminal sanctions for those who fail to report child sexual abuse.",
      "Phillips dismissed suggestions the government had been prompted into action by Mr Musk's interventions.",
      "\"To be perfectly honest, the things that Yvette Cooper was announcing yesterday are all things that we were working incredibly hard on ensuring,\" she said.",
      "\"So all of these things are things that would be happening - all that this current furore has done is made it so that everybody's talking about it.\"",

      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",

      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",

      "On expanding use of the private sector, Sir Keir acknowledged \"some would not like this\" but added: \"I'm not interested in putting ideology before patients.\"",
      "A key Labour election pledge, now included in the government's six main priorities, is for 92% of patients to begin treatment or be given the all clear within 18 weeks, by the end of this Parliament.",

    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",
      "Helen Walker, the head of Carers UK, which represents millions of unpaid people who provide care to family members, said families were \"under intense pressure and providing more care than ever before\".",

      "There have been numerous investigations into the systematic rape of young women by organised gangs, including in Rotherham, Cornwall, Derbyshire, Rochdale and Bristol.",

      "An inquiry into abuse in Rotherham found 1,400 children had been sexually abused over a 16-year period, predominantly by British Pakistani men.",
      "An investigation in Telford found that up to 1,000 girls had been abused over 40 years - and that some cases had not been investigated because of \"nervousness about race\".",

      "Questions about the conduct of local authorities, the police and social care needed answering on a national scale, he argued. Philp also did not rule out the inquiry looking at the role of Sir Keir Starmer, who was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013.",

    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",

      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

    "title": "How Trump and Musk's interventions prompt fresh diplomatic challenge",
    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 19:17:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",
      "But for now officials are monitoring their timelines closely. US social media diplomacy is back and some of it is heading our way.",

    "story": [
      "Bumblebees have been found to be starting nests in the depths of winter due to climate change, say conservationists.",
      "The charity Buglife said active worker bumblebees, which do most of the work in a nest, were spotted in Aberdeen during mild weather over the Christmas break.",
      "It said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.",
      "Buglife said the nests were at a \"high risk\" of failing because of the shortage of flowers for the bees to collect nectar and pollen from, and the risk of a return to colder weather.",
      "Bees teach each other how to problem-solve - study",
      "Caught by the buzz: Saving bees is 'the best job'",
      "Scientists have previously said climate change had caused a widespread loss of bumblebees across the world.",
      "The insects, an important pollinator, normally hibernate through winter into spring.",
      "The Christmas period was unseasonably mild, but since then there have been days of cold and snowy weather.",
      "Buglife said at least two of the UK's 25 species of bumblebee were believed to have started nest-building early.",
      "The charity's Paul Hetherington said: \"In 2019 Buglife ran a bee survey over the Christmas to New Year break and were amazed at the results with honeybees and bumblebees found from Jersey through to Thurso.",
      "\"This year one of my colleagues based in Aberdeen spotted active worker bumblebees over the Christmas break.",
      "\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"",
      "Mr Hetherington said a lack of flowers and wintry weather left the nests at risk of collapse and could kill the bees.",
      "He added: \"If this happens there will be no new queens produced meaning far fewer to emerge in spring further feeding the known decline in bumblebees.\"",
      "The milder conditions also led to people encountering a far less welcome invertebrate - ticks.",
      "The tiny parasitic spider-like creatures are usually active from early spring to late autumn.",
      "Lyme disease, a bacterial infection which causes a range of health problems, can be spread to humans from some tick bites.",
      "Inverness was among places the pests were found to be active, with one spotted in woodland in the city's Ness Castle area on 28 December.",
      "Over winter, adult ticks do not hibernate and instead shelter from low temperatures in long vegetation.",
      "Mr Hetherington said: \"This means that they are still potentially active and the period around 28 December was relatively warm for the time of year, a likely consequence of climate change is increased periods of tick activity in the same way that bumblebees have been spotted on the wing across Scotland this December.\"",
      "The charity Lyme Disease Action said it was concerning situation.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 03:49:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year across England, Wales and Scotland.",
    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "UK to finish with coal power after 142 years",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "As a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.",
      "Back in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.",
      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",
      "Britain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.",
      "On around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.",
      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",
      "Last month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.",
      "\"We need cheap, reliable energy - not even higher bills,\" she said."

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 01:28:52 GMT",
    "summary": "After edging close to extinction, there are now some 2,000 Iberian lynxes in Spain and Portugal.",
    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

      "The legislation, which bans the use of dolphins and whales in marine zoo shows, was passed in 2021 but comes into effect next year.",

      "Several destinations for the whales have been proposed but there is disagreement on where they should go and what should happen to them.",
      "Most experts agree that releasing the two whales, which are Icelandic orcas specifically, into the wild would not be suitable as both were born in captivity and would not have the skills to survive.",

      "'We'll close off a bay for them'",

      "The Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP) proposes to close off an area of seawater measuring 40 hectares (98 acres) with nets.",
      "Wikie and Keijo could then use the large expanse of water, with human support from vets and welfare workers, until the end of their lives.",
      "The average lifespan of a male killer whale is about 30 years, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency. Females usually live about 50 years.",

      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",

      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",

      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",

      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",

    "story": [
      "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.",
      "About 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.",
      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",
      "The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January."

The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023.",
      "This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024.",
      "The Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.",
      "The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars.",
      "BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.",
      "It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.",
      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",
      "Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.",
      "At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.",
      "Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.",
      "Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.",
      "But the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts.",
      "\"If you don't meet expectations, it can be pretty tough out there,\" said Christopher Carey of the Carnegie Investment Council.",
      "Last month, Honda and Nissan confirmed that they were holding merger talks, as the two Japanese firms seek to fight back against competition from the Chinese car industry.",
      "Earlier in the month, the boss of car making giant Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, quit with immediate effect following a boardroom clash.",
      "His abrupt exit from the company - which owns brands including Vauxhall, Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot and Chrysler - came two months after Stellantis issued a profit warning.",
      "Some governments have stepped in to protect domestic companies.",
      "In October, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese-made EVs came into force across the trade bloc.",
      "The US has also imposed a 100% duty on EVs from China and President-elect Donald Trump is expected to impose further tariffs on imports.",
      "BYD has still been expanding its foothold in emerging economies.",
      "But last month, it faced a setback in Brazil - its largest overseas market - with authorities halting the construction of a BYD factory, saying workers lived in conditions comparable to \"slavery\".",
      "BYD said it had cut ties with the construction firm involved and remained committed to a \"full compliance with Brazilian legislation\"."

      "A US court has rejected the Biden administration's bid to restore \"net neutrality\" rules, finding that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate internet providers like utilities.",
      "It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally.",

      "The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.",
      "In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue.",
      "But they said the court no longer had to give \"deference\" to the FCC's reading of the law, pointing to a recent Supreme Court decision that limits the authority of federal agencies to interpret laws, a decision that critics expect will be used to weaken regulation in the years ahead.",
      "\"Applying Loper Bright, means we can end the FCC's vacillations,\" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said.",

      "Public Knowledge, a progressive-leaning internet policy group, said the decision had weakened the FCC's power to shape privacy protections, implement public safety measures and take other action.",
      "It said it believed the court had erred in ruling that internet service providers were simply offering an \"information service\" rather than acting as telecommunications companies.",
      "\"The court has created a dangerous regulatory gap that leaves consumers vulnerable and gives broadband providers unchecked power over Americans' internet access,\" it said.",

    "title": "A mother's mission to stop jaundice causing cerebral palsy in Nigeria",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 02:22:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Cerebral palsy is believed to be one of the most common neurological disorders in Nigeria.",
    "story": [
      "Although Babatunde Fashola, affectionately known as Baba, is 22 years old, he is less than 70cm (2ft 4in) tall.",
      "He has cerebral palsy and requires lifelong care. He can neither speak nor walk and is fed via a tube attached to his stomach.",
      "As a baby, he was abandoned by his parents but 10 years ago, he found a home at the Cerebral Palsy Centre in the Nigerian city of Lagos.",
      "\"Baba weighs about 12kg [26lb]. He is doing well,\" the facility's founder, Nonye Nweke, tells me when I visit.",
      "Ms Nweke and her staff work around the clock to support him and other youngsters living with permanent brain damage.",
      "Although there is a lack of official data, cerebral palsy is believed to be one of the most common neurological disorders in Nigeria. In 2017, a medical professor from the University of Lagos said 700,000 people had the condition.",
      "For many of those living with cerebral palsy in the country, their condition was caused by a common phenomenon among newborns - neonatal jaundice.",
      "This is caused by a build-up of bilirubin, a yellow substance, in the blood, meaning the babies' skins have a yellow tinge.",
      "Professor Chinyere Ezeaka, a paediatrician at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, tells the BBC that more than 60% of all babies suffer from jaundice.",
      "Most babies recover within days. More severe cases need further medical intervention - and even then the condition is easily treatable.",
      "Children are basically exposed to ultra-violet light to dissolve the excess bilirubin in their red blood cells. The treatment lasts a few days depending on the severity.",
      "However, in Nigeria this treatment is often not immediately available, which is why the country is among the five with the most neurological disorders caused by untreated jaundice in the world, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "Any treatment for neonatal jaundice \"must occur within the first 10 days of life, else [the condition] could cause permanent brain damage and severe cerebral palsy\", says Prof Ezeaka.",
      "To make matters worse, the West African country lacks facilities to care for those with neurological disorders. There are just three cerebral palsy centres, all privately run, in Nigeria, which has a population of more than 200 million.",
      "Ms Nweke - a single mother - set up the Cerebral Palsy Centre after struggling to find support for her own daughter, Zimuzo.",
      "\"When I took her to a day-care [centre], they asked me to take her back because other mothers would withdraw their children. As a mum, I must say it was quite devastating,\" Ms Nweke tells the BBC.",
      "Zimuzo is now 17, and Ms Nweke's Cerebral Palsy Centre provides full-time support for others with similar experiences.",
      "On the day I visit, colourful playtime mats and toys are neatly arranged on the floor. Mickey Mouse and his friends converse on a wide-screen television in the lounge.",
      "Twelve youngsters, some as young as five, gaze at the TV, their bright environment ignored for a moment. They are all immobile and non-speaking.",
      "At lunchtime, caregivers help the youngsters eat. Some take in liquified food through tubes attached to their stomachs.",
      "Carefully and slowly, the carers support their heads with pillows and push the contents of their syringes into the tubes.",
      "The youngsters are fed every two hours and require regular muscular massages to prevent stiffness.",
      "But they are the lucky 12 receiving free care from the Cerebral Palsy Centre, which is funded exclusively by donors.",
      "The facility has a long waiting list - Ms Nweke has received more than 100 applications.",
      "But taking on more youngsters would require extra financial support. The cost of caring for someone at the centre is at least $1,000 (\u00a3790) a month - a huge amount in a country where the national minimum wage is about $540 a year.",
      "\"As a mum, I must say it's quite overwhelming. You have moments of depression, it gives you heartaches and it is quite expensive - in fact it's the most expensive congenital disorder to manage,\" Ms Nweke says.",
      "\"And then of course, it keeps you away from people because you don't discuss the same things. They are talking of their babies, walking, enjoying those baby moments. You are not doing that. You are sad,\" she adds.",
      "Ms Nweke explains that she adopted Zimuzo from an orphanage.",
      "A few months after taking her new daughter home, Ms Nweke realised Zimuzo was not developing in the same way as the children around her were. She was assessed at a hospital and diagnosed with cerebral palsy.",
      "Ms Nweke was told she could take Zimuzo, who was then just  a few months old, back to the orphanage and adopt another baby instead, but she refused.",
      "\"I decided to keep her and I began researching what the disorder was about, the treatment and type of care my child would need - she's my life.",
      "\"I was also told by the doctors she won't live beyond two years. Well here we are - 17 years later,\" says a smiling Ms Nweke.",
      "A lack of awareness and adequate medical support hinders the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal jaundice in Nigeria.",
      "Ms Nweke also says the common local belief that children with congenital disorders are spiritually damaged or bewitched leads to stigmatisation.",
      "Some children with neurological disorders - mostly in Nigeria's rural areas - are labelled witches. In some cases, they are abandoned in prayer houses or cast out of their families.",
      "Ms Nweke is not alone in her mission to dispel myths and improve care.",
      "The Oscar Project - a charity aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal jaundice - recently began operating in Lagos.",
      "The project is named after Vietnamese-born British disability advocate, Oscar Anderson, whose untreated jaundice caused his cerebral palsy.",
      "\"We're equipping health facilities at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels with the equipment to treat jaundice, primarily light boxes, but also detection and screening equipment,\" Toyin Saraki, who oversaw the launch, tells the BBC.",
      "Project Oscar, backed by consumer health firm Reckitt, is training 300 health workers in Lagos. The hope over the first year is to reach 10,000 mothers, screen 9,000 children and introduce new protocols to try and prevent babies with jaundice from developing cerebral palsy.",
      "In a country where the public health system is overstretched, the government has little to say about the disorder, although it lauded the Oscar project's goals.",
      "Treatment for neonatal jaundice is significantly cheaper than the cost of lifelong care, doctors say.",
      "First launched in Vietnam in 2019, Project Oscar has helped about 150,000 children in the Asian country.",
      "Mr Anderson, 22, says he wants to prevent other children experiencing what he has been through.",
      "\"People with disabilities are not to be underestimated,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "He is working to ensure screening for every newborn infant for neonatal jaundice, and, with the support and courage of mums, midwives and medical professionals, ensure there is better understanding and quicker treatment.",
      "However, achieving this is a hugely ambitious goal in Africa's most-populous country, where thousands of babies are born each year with neonatal jaundice.",
      "Regardless, Mr Anderson is determined to defy the odds.",
      "\"The work doesn't stop until every baby is protected against neonatal jaundice,\" he says.",

    "summary": "Although some of Europe's leaders have found favour with the billionaire, others are worried by his interventions.",
    "story": [
      "Few European leaders have felt the lash of Elon Musk's social media outbursts more than Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "The tech-billionaire owner of X has called him an \"incompetent fool\" and urged him to resign. On Thursday Musk will use his platform to host Alice Weidel, the head of Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD for a lengthy chat.",
      "For many German politicians it smacks of political interference, with the AfD running second in the polls ahead of federal elections on 23 February.",
      "\"You have to stay cool,\" says Scholz. \"Don't feed the troll.\"",
      "Although some of Europe's leaders, notably Italy's Giorgia Meloni, have found favour with Musk, others are finding it hard to ignore him, as he ventures into their domestic politics ahead of a new role of adviser to the incoming US President Donald Trump.",
      "In the space of 24 hours, four European governments have objected to Musk's posts.",
      "France's Emmanuel Macron was among the first to expressed incredulity on Monday.",
      "\"Ten years ago, who would have believed it, if we had been told that the owner of one of the biggest social networks in the world would support a new, international reactionary movement and intervene directly in elections, including in Germany?\" he said.",
      "Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store weighed in, too, saying he found it \"worrying that a man with considerable access to social networks and significant economic resources is so directly involved in the internal affairs of other countries\".",
      "Spain's government spokeswoman, Pilar Alegr\u00eda, said digital platforms such as X should act with \"absolute neutrality and above all without any kind of interference\".",
      "Musk has highlighted crime statistics in Norway and Spain, and blamed a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany on \"mass unchecked immigration\".",
      "In the past few days, Musk has written numerous posts attacking the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his administration over grooming gangs and child sexual exploitation.",
      "Musk looms large over UK politics as MPs return for 2025",
      "Musk's 'disinformation' endangering me, says Phillips",
      "\"Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they're interested in themselves,\" said the UK prime minister,  without mentioning Musk personally.",
      "Two notable exceptions in Europe are Italy and Hungary.",
      "Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has cultivated close ties with Elon Musk and calls him a \"genius\" and an \"extraordinary innovator\".",
      "And Hungary's Viktor Orban, who met Musk while visiting Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, shares Musk's dislike of Hungarian-born liberal philanthropist George Soros.",
      "But it is the tech-billionaire's intervention in German politics that is most contentious, because of imminent elections.",
      "He has spoken out several times in favour of the AfD in recent weeks, and wrote a highly controversial article for Welt am Sonntag in which he called the AfD the \"last spark of hope\" for Germany.",
      "Musk justified his intervention at the time because of his company Tesla's financial investment in Germany. He said portraying the AfD as right-wing, extremist was \"clearly false\", because Alice Weidel had a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka.",
      "German security services have labelled the AfD either as right-wing extremist or suspected extremist and the courts have ruled it pursues goals against democracy.",
      "While Olaf Scholz has sought to stay calm, the Greens' candidate for chancellor, Robert Habeck, was more blunt: \"Hands off our democracy, Mr Musk.\"",
      "Liberal FDP leader Christian Lindner has suggested that Musk's aim might perhaps be to weaken Germany in the US interest, \"by recommending voting for a party that would harm us economically and isolate us politically\".",
      "The former head of the European Commission's digital agenda, Thierry Breton, took to X last weekend to warn Alice Weidel, the AfD's candidate for chancellor, that Thursday's live chat with Musk would give her \"a significant and valuable advantage over your competitors\".",
      "The European Commission has said there is nothing in the EU's Digital Services rules that bans a live stream, or anyone expressing personal views.",
      "However, a spokesman warned that platform owners should not provide \"preferential treatment\". Musk's X is already under investigation and the EU says the live stream will come under that inquiry.",
      "While Musk has been outspoken on German politics, he has also been extending his business interests in Italy.",
      "Giorgia Meloni had just been on a whirlwind trip to have dinner with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago when reports emerged that Italy was in talks with Musk's SpaceX to sign a $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) deal, under which Starlink satellites would provide encrypted internet and telecommunications services for the Italian government.",
      "The deal does not yet appear to have been concluded and Rome has swiftly denied any contracts have been signed.",
      "Musk said on Monday that he was \"ready to provide Italy [with] the most secure and advanced connectivity\" \u2013 without confirming a deal had been reached.",
      "But the suggestion that Starlink could be entrusted with safeguarding the Italian government's communications was enough to cause alarm among some opposition politicians in Rome.",
      "\"Handing over such a delicate service to Musk while he is sponsoring the European far right, spreading fake news and meddling in the internal politics of European countries cannot be an option,\" said centrist leader Carlo Calenda."

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:21:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Immigration has long been a polarising issue in the West but Canada mostly avoided it - until now",
    "story": [
      "Immigration has long been a polarising issue in the West but Canada mostly avoided it - until now. With protests and campaign groups springing up in certain quarters, some argue that this - together with housing shortages and rising rents - contributed to Justin Trudeau's resignation. But could Donald Trump's arrival inflame it further?",
      "At first glance, the single bedroom for rent in Brampton, Ontario looks like a bargain. True, there's barely any floor space, but the asking price is only C$550 (\u00a3300) a month in a Toronto suburb where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom flat is C$2,261. Inspect it more closely, however, and this is actually a small bathroom converted into sleeping quarters. A mattress is jammed up next to the sink, the toilet is nearby.",
      "The ad, originally posted on Facebook Marketplace, has generated hundreds of comments online. \"Disgusting,\" wrote one Reddit user. \"Hey 20-somethings, you're looking at your future,\" says another.",
      "But there are other listings like it - one room for rent, also in Brampton, shows a bed squashed near a staircase in what appears to be a laundry area. Another rental in Scarborough, a district in Ontario, offers a double bed in the corner of a kitchen.",
      "While Canada might have a lot of space, there aren't enough homes and in the past three years, rents across the country have increased by almost 20%, according to property consultancy Urbanation.",
      "In all, some 2.4 million Canadian families are crammed into homes that are too small, in urgent need of major repairs or are seriously unaffordable, a government watchdog report released in December has suggested.",
      "This accommodation shortage has come to a head at the same time that inflation is hitting Canadians hard - and these issues have, in turn, moved another issue high up the agenda in the country: immigration.",
      "For the first time a majority of Canadians, who have long been welcoming to newcomers, are questioning how their cities can manage.",
      "Politics in other Western countries has long been wrapped up in polarised debates surrounding immigration but until recently Canada had mostly avoided that issue, perhaps because of its geography. Now, however, there appears to be a profound shift in attitude.",
      "In 2022, 27% of Canadians said there were too many immigrants coming into the country, according to a survey by data and research firm Environics. By 2024, that number had increased to 58%.",
      "Campaign groups have sprung up too and there have been marches protesting against immigration in Ottawa, Vancouver and Calgary, and elsewhere around the country.",
      "\"I would say it was very much taboo, like no one would really talk about it,\" explains Peter Kratzar, a software engineer and the founder of Cost of Living Canada, a protest group that was formed in 2024. \"[But] things have really unfrozen.\"",
      "Stories like that of the bathroom for rent in Brampton have fuelled this, he suggests: \"People might say, like, this is all anecdotal evidence. But the evidence keeps popping up. You see it over and over again.\"",
      "\"People became concerned about how the immigration system was being managed,\" adds Keith Neuman, executive director at Environics. \"And we believe it's the first time the public really thought about the management of the system.\"",

      "Who might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?",
      "Why the Trudeau era has come to an end now",
      "What happens next for Canada?",
      "Once the golden boy of Canadian politics, prime minister Justin Trudeau, resigned on 6 January during a crucial election year, amid this widespread discontent over immigration levels.",
      "His approval levels before his resignation were just 22% - a far cry from the first year of his premiership, when 65% of voters said they approved of him.",
      "Though immigration is not the main reason for his low approval levels nor his resignation - he cited \"having to fight internal battles\" - he was accused of acting too late when dealing with rising anxiety over inflation and housing that many blamed, in part, on immigration.",
      "\"While immigration may not have been the immediate cause of the resignation, it may have been the icing on the cake,\" says Professor Jonathan Rose, head of the department of political studies at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.",
      "Under Trudeau's administration, the Canadian government deliberately chose to radically boost the numbers of people coming to the country after the pandemic, believing that boosting quotas for foreign students and temporary workers, in addition to skilled immigrants, would jumpstart the economy.",
      "The population, which was 35 million 10 years ago, now tops 40 million.",
      "Immigration was responsible for the vast majority of that increase - figures from Canada's national statistics agency show that in 2024, more than 90% of population growth came from immigration.",
      "As well as overall migration levels, the number of refugees has risen too. In 2013, there were 10,365 refugee applicants in Canada - by 2023, that number had increased to 143,770.",
      "Voter dissatisfaction with immigration was \"more a symptom than a cause\" of Trudeau's downfall, argues Prof Rose. \"It reflects his perceived inability to read the room in terms of public opinion.\"",
      "It's unclear who might replace Trudeau from within his own Liberal Party but ahead of the forthcoming election, polls currently favour the Conservative Party, whose leader Pierre Poilievre advocates keeping the number of new arrivals below the number of new homes being built.",
      "Since Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November, Poilievre \"has been speaking much more about immigration\", claims Prof Rose - \"so much that it has become primed in the minds of voters\".",
      "Certainly Trump's arrival for a second term is set to pour oil on an already inflamed issue in Canada, regardless of who the new prime minister is.",
      "He won the US election in part on a pledge to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants - and since his victory, he has said that he will enlist the military and declare a national emergency to follow through on his promise.",
      "He also announced plans to employ 25% tariffs on Canadian goods unless border security is tightened.",
      "Drones, cameras and policing the border",
      "Canada and the US share the world's longest undefended border. Stretching almost 9,000km (5,592 miles), much of it crosses heavily forested wilderness and is demarcated by \"The Slash,\" a six-metre wide land clearing.",
      "Unlike America's southern border, there are no walls. This has long been a point of pride between Ottawa and Washington - a sign of their close ties.",
      "After Trump first entered office in 2017,  the number of asylum claims skyrocketed, with thousands walking across the border to Canada. The number of claims went from just under 24,000 in 2016 to 55,000 a year by 2018, according to the Canadian government. Almost all crossed from New York state into the Canadian province of Quebec.",
      "In 2023, Canada and the US agreed to a tightened border deal that stopped most migrants from crossing the land border from one country to another. Under the agreement, migrants that come into contact with the authorities within 14 days of crossing any part of the border into either the US or Canada must return to whichever country they entered first \u2014 in order to declare asylum there.",
      "The deal, reworked by Trudeau and Joe Biden, is based on the idea that both the US and Canada are safe countries for asylum seekers.",
      "This time around, Canada's national police force \u2013 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) \u2013 says it began preparing a contingency plan for increased migrant crossings at the border well ahead of Trump being sworn in.",
      "This includes a raft of new technology, from drones and night vision goggles, to surveillance cameras hidden in the forest.",
      "\"Worst-case scenario would be people crossing in large numbers everywhere on the territory,\" RCMP spokesperson Charles Poirier warned in November. \"Let's say we had 100 people per day entering across the border, then it's going to be hard because our officers will basically have to cover huge distances in order to arrest everyone.\"",
      "Now, the national government has committed a further C$1.3bn (\u00a3555m) to its border security plan.",
      "'We want our future back!'",
      "Not everyone blames the housing crisis on the recent rise in immigration. It was \"30 years in the making\" because politicians have failed to build affordable units, argues Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow.",
      "Certainly the country has a long history of welcoming newcomers. \"Close to 50% of the population of Canada is first or second generation,\" explains Mr Neuman. \"That means either they came from another country, or one or both of their parents came from another country. In Toronto, Vancouver, that's over 80%.\"",
      "This makes Canada \"a very different place than a place that has a homogeneous population,\" he argues.",
      "He has been involved in a survey examining attitudes towards newcomers for 40 years. \"If you ask Canadians: what's the most important or distinctive thing about Canada, or what makes the country unique? The number one response is 'multiculturalism' or 'diversity',\" he says.",
      "Nonetheless, he says the shift in public opinion - and the rise in concerns about immigration - has been \"dramatic\".",
      "\"Now there is not only broader public concern, but much more open discussion,\" he says. \"There are more questions being asked about how is the system working? How come it isn't working?\"",
      "At one of the protests in Toronto, a crowd turned out with hand-painted signs, some proclaiming: \"We want our future back!\" and \"End Mass Immigration\".",
      "\"We do need to put a moratorium on immigration,\" argues Mr Kratzar, whose group has taken part in some of them. \"We need to delay that so wages can catch up on the cost of rents.\"",
      "Accusations against newcomers are spreading on social media too. Last summer, Natasha White, who describes herself as a resident of Wasaga Beach in Ontario, claimed on TikTok that some newcomers had been digging holes on the beach and defecating in them.",
      "The post generated hundreds of thousands of views and a torrent of anti-foreigner hatred, with many arguing that newcomers should \"go home\".",
      "Tent cities and full homeless shelters",
      "People I interviewed who work closely with asylum seekers in Canada say that the heightened concerns around the need for more border security is making asylum seekers feel unsettled and afraid.",
      "Abdulla Daoud, executive director at the Refugee Center in Montreal, believes that the vulnerable asylum seekers he works with feel singled out by the focus on migrant numbers since the US election. \"They're definitely more anxious,\" he says. \"I think they're coming in and they're feeling, 'Okay, am I going to be welcomed here? Am I in the right place or not?'\"",
      "Those hoping to stay in Canada as refugees can't access official immigration settlement services until it has been decided they truly need asylum. This process once took two weeks but it can now take as long as three years.",
      "Tent cities to house newly-arrived refugees and food banks with empty shelves have sprung up in Toronto. The city's homeless shelters are often reported to be full. Last winter, two refugee applicants froze to death after sleeping on Toronto's streets.",
      "Toronto mayor Olivia Chow, an immigrant herself having moved to Canada from Hong Kong at age 13, says: \"People are seeing that, even with working two jobs or three jobs, they can't have enough money to pay the rent and feed the kids.",
      "\"I understand the hardship of having a life that is not affordable, and the fear of being evicted, absolutely, I get it. But to blame that on the immigration system is unfair.\"",
      "Trudeau: 'We didn't get the balance quite right'",
      "With frustrations growing, Trudeau announced a major change in October: a 20% reduction in immigration targets over three years. \"As we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labour needs and maintaining population growth, we didn't get the balance quite right,\" he conceded.",
      "He added that he wanted to give all levels of government time to catch up \u2013 to accommodate more people. But, given that he has since resigned, is it enough? And does the Trump presidency and the increasing anti-immigrant sentiment on that side of the border risk spilling further into Canada?",
      "Mr Daoud has his own view. \"Unfortunately, I think the Trump presidency had its impact on Canadian politics,\" he says. \"I think a lot of politicians are using this as a way to fear-monger.\"",
      "Others are less convinced that it will have much of an impact. \"Canadians are better than that,\" says Olivia Chow. \"We remember that successive waves of refugees helped create Toronto and Canada.\"",
      "Channel migrants: The real reason so many are fleeing Vietnam for the UK",
      "Nigel Farage claims Reform can win power - but how realistic is that?",
      "The endgame in Ukraine: How the war could come to a close in 2025",
      "Politicians wading into the debate around population growth ahead of the next election will be conscious of the fact that half of Canadians are first and second-generation immigrants themselves. \"If the Conservatives win the next election, we can expect a reduction in immigration,\" says Prof Jonathan Rose. But he adds that Poilievre will have to walk \"a bit of fine line\".",
      "Prof Rose says: \"Since immigrant-heavy ridings [constituencies] in Toronto and Vancouver will be important to any electoral victory, he can't be seen as anti-immigration, merely recalibrating it to suit economic and housing policy.\"",
      "And there are a large number of Canadians, including business leaders and academics, who believe that the country must continue to pursue an assertive growth policy to combat Canada's falling birth rate.",
      "\"I really have high hopes for Canadians,\" adds Lisa Lalande of the Century Initiative, which advocates for policies that would see Canada's population increase to 100 million by 2100. \"I actually think we will rise above where we are now.",
      "\"I think we're just really concerned about affordability [and] cost of living - not about immigrants themselves. We recognise they're too important to our culture.\"",

      "Under the Israeli prime minister's vision for a post-war Gaza, Israel would control security indefinitely, and Palestinians with \"no links to groups hostile to Israel\" - so none of the existing major Palestinian political parties - would run the territory.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 12:12:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A Holocaust denier and unrepentant extremist on race and immigration, the far-right politician has died at 96.",
    "story": [
      "Jean-Marie Le Pen founded France's far right in the 1970s and mounted a strong challenge for the presidency. But it was only when he handed the reins on to his daughter that his rebranded party caught sight of power.",
      "He has died aged 96, his family has said.",
      "Le Pen's supporters saw him as a charismatic champion of the every man, unafraid to speak out on hard topics.",
      "And for several decades he was seen as France's most controversial political figure.",
      "His critics denounced him as a far-right bigot and the courts convicted him several times for his radical remarks.",
      "A Holocaust denier and an unrepentant extremist on race, gender and immigration, he devoted his political career to pushing himself and his views into the French political mainstream.",
      "The so-called Devil of the Republic came runner-up in the 2002 French presidential election, but he was resoundingly defeated. That devil had to be taken out of the National Front if it was going to progress further - a process that became known as \"de-demonisation\".",
      "For his part, the five-time presidential candidate - who started his political life fighting Communists and conservatives alike - described himself as \"ni droite, ni gauche, fran\u00e7ais\" - not right, not left, but French.",
      "And all the French had their opinions about Le Pen. In 2015, Marine Le Pen expelled her father from the National Front he had founded four decades previously.",
      "\"Maybe by getting rid of me she wanted to make some kind of gesture to the establishment,\" he would later tell the BBC's Hugh Schofield.",
      "\"But think how much better she would be doing if she had not excluded me from the party!\"",
      "Pupil of the Nation",
      "Jean-Marie Le Pen was born in the small Breton village of La Trinit\u00e9-sur-Mer on 20 June 1928.",
      "He lost his father at 14 when his fishing boat hit a German mine. Le Pen became a Pupille de la Nation - the term French authorities use for those who had a parent wounded or killed in war - entitling him to state funding and support.",
      "Two years later he tried to join the French Resistance, but was turned down. He wrote in an autobiography that his first \"war decoration\" was a \"magisterial slap\" from his mother, when he came home and told her what he had tried to do.",
      "In 1954, Le Pen joined the French Foreign Legion. He was posted to Indochina - modern-day Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, at that time controlled by France - then two years later to Egypt, when France, the UK and Israel invaded the country in a bid to take control of the Suez Canal. Both conflicts ended in French defeat.",
      "But it was his time in Algeria that would define so much of his politics, and his career.",
      "He was posted there as an intelligence officer, when Algerians were fighting a brutal but ultimately successful war of independence against Paris.",
      "Le Pen saw the loss of Algeria as one of the great betrayals in French history, fuelling his loathing of World War Two hero and then-President Charles de Gaulle, who ended the war for the colony.",
      "During that independence war, he allegedly took part in the torture of Algerian prisoners, something he always denied.",
      "Decades later he would unsuccessfully sue two French newspapers, Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9 and Lib\u00e9ration, for reporting the allegations.",
      "Political rise",
      "Le Pen was first elected to the French parliament in 1956 in a party led by militant right-wing shopkeepers' leader Pierre Poujade. But they fell out and Le Pen briefly returned to the army in Algeria. By 1962 he had lost his seat in the National Assembly and was to spend the next decade in the political wilderness.",
      "During a spell in 1965 as campaign manager for far-right presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, Le Pen defended the war-time government of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who supported the occupying Nazi German forces.",
      "\"Was General de Gaulle more brave than Marshal P\u00e9tain in the occupied zone? This isn't sure. It was much easier to resist in London than to resist in France,\" he said.",
      "It was during that election campaign that he lost the sight in his left eye. For several years he wore an eye patch - giving rise to stories of a political punch-up. In reality, he had lost it while putting up a tent.",
      "\"While wielding the mallet... a shock in my eye, I have to be hospitalised. Retinal detachment,\" he would write in a memoir years later.",
      "It was not until 1972 that Le Pen's political ascent truly began. That year he set up the Front National (FN), a far-right party created to unify the nationalist movement in France.",
      "At first, the party had little support. Le Pen ran for the presidency in 1974 for the FN, but won less than 1% of the vote. In 1981 he failed to even get enough signatures on his nomination form to stand.",
      "But the party gradually attracted voters with its increasingly strident anti-immigration policy.",
      "The south of France in particular - where large numbers of North African immigrants had come to settle - began to swing behind the FN. In the 1984 European elections, it gained 10% of the vote.",
      "Le Pen himself won a seat in the European Parliament, which he would hold for more than 30 years.",
      "As an MEP he voiced his hatred of the European Union and what he saw as its interference in French affairs. He would later call the euro \"the currency of occupation\".",
      "But his rising political fortunes did not stop him giving voice to shocking views.",
      "In a notorious interview in 1987, he played down the Holocaust - Nazi Germany's murder of six million Jews. \"I do not say that the gas chambers did not exist. I never personally saw them,\" he told an interviewer. \"I have never particularly studied the issue, but I believe they are a point of detail in the history of World War Two.\"",
      "His comments about le d\u00e9tail would dog the rest of his career.",
      "Regardless of the controversy, his popularity grew. In the 1988 presidential election, he took 14% of the vote. That figure rose to 15% in 1995.",
      "Then came 2002. With many mainstream candidates dividing opposition support, Jean-Marie Le Pen squeezed into the second and final round of the presidential election.",
      "The result sent shockwaves through French society. More than a million protesters took to the streets to oppose Le Pen's ideas.",
      "The far-right politician inspired such revulsion from the majority that parties across the political spectrum called on their supporters to back President Jacques Chirac for a second term. Chirac took 82% of the vote, the biggest victory in French political history.",
      "Split with his daughter",
      "Le Pen would run again for the presidency, in 2007, but by then his political star had waned. Le Pen, then the oldest candidate to ever contest the presidency, came fourth.",
      "Within months of that vote, newly elected President Nicolas Sarkozy - who Le Pen had attacked as being \"foreign\", because of his Greek, Jewish and Hungarian ancestors - seized on the FN's main campaign themes of national security and immigration in legislative elections, and stated openly that he intended to go after FN votes.",
      "It swept the rug out from under the FN. Le Pen's party failed to pick up a single seat in the National Assembly and, dogged by financial problems, he announced plans to sell his party headquarters outside Paris.",
      "In 2011, he resigned as party leader and was replaced by his daughter, Marine.",
      "Father and daughter fell out almost immediately. Marine le Pen consciously moved the party away from her father's more extreme policies, to make it more attractive to Eurosceptic mainstream voters.",
      "Then the relationship shattered irreparably.",
      "In 2015, Jean-Marie Le Pen repeated le d\u00e9tail, his Holocaust denial, in a radio interview. After months of bitter legal wrangling, FN party members eventually voted to expel their own founder.",
      "Two years later, during her own presidential campaign, Marine changed the party name to Rassemblement National, or National Rally.",
      "Her father condemned the move as suicidal.",
      "But Jean-Marie Le Pen remained unrepentant.",
      "\"The d\u00e9tail was in 1987. Then it came back in 2015. That's not exactly every day!\" he told the BBC in an interview in 2017.",
      "He even proved sanguine about the rifts with his family - at least publicly.",
      "\"It is life! Life is not a smooth tranquil stream,\" he said.",
      "\"I am accustomed to adversity. For 60 years I have rowed against the current. Never once have we had the wind at our backs! No indeed, one thing we never got used to was the easy life!\""

    "title": "Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 08:45:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Pictures from China, where cases of the virus are surging, have people worried on social media.",
    "story": [
      "In recent weeks, scenes of hospitals in China overrun with masked people have made their rounds on social media, sparking worries of another pandemic.",
      "Beijing has since acknowledged a surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV), especially among children, and it attributed this to a seasonal spike.",
      "But HMPV is not like Covid-19, public health experts have said, noting that the virus has been around for decades, with almost every child being infected by their fifth birthday.",
      "However, in some very young children and people with weakened immune systems, it can cause more serious illness. Here is what you need to know.",
      "What is HMPV and how does it spread?",
      "HMPV is a virus that will lead to a mild upper respiratory tract infection - practically indistinguishable from flu - for most people.",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, the virus spreads through direct contact between people or when someone touches surfaces contaminated with it.",
      "Symptoms for most people include cough, fever and nasal congestion.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus, along with those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, says Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases physician in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" among the immunocompromised will develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring - some experts say this is because the viruses survive better in the cold and they pass more easily from one person to another as people stay indoors more often.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "In fact many countries in the northern hemisphere, including but not limited to China, are experiencing an increased prevalence of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",
      "Data from health authorities in the US and UK shows that these countries, too, have been experiencing a spike in HMPV cases since October last year.",
      "Is HMPV like Covid-19? How worried should we be?",
      "Fears of a Covid-19 style pandemic are overblown, the experts said, noting that pandemics are typically caused by novel pathogens, which is not the case for HMPV.",
      "HMPV is globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" says Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",
      "\"So overall, I don't think there is currently any signs of a more serious global issue.\"",
      "Still, Dr Hsu advises standard general precautions such as wearing a mask in crowded places, avoiding crowds where possible if one is at higher risk of more severe illness from respiratory virus infections, practising good hand hygiene, and getting the flu vaccine."

      "Four months shy of his 38th birthday, Djokovic will spend January trying to win an 11th Australian Open title.",
      "It would be a 25th Grand Slam title - more than anyone in history. Margaret Court's record is effectively the only one he has left to break.",
      "\"You can never count him out if everything goes right,\" six-time Grand Slam champion Stefan Edberg told BBC Sport.",
      "\"My personal view is his best chance is the Australian Open or possibly Wimbledon, with all the experience he has on grass.",
      "\"Everything needs to go for him - he's a year older and hasn't played so many matches over the last six months.\"",
      "'He is 37 - you have to be reasonable'",
      "Last season was the first year since 2017 that Djokovic did not win a major title. He also did not win an ATP title for the first time since 2005.",
      "But he did clinch Olympic gold with a phenomenal win over Carlos Alcaraz in the final in Paris. That came just two months after knee surgery and three weeks after a chastening loss to the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final.",
      "Olympic gold had been the only prize missing from Djokovic's collection. It was his target for the year, and the target was duly achieved.",
      "\"My one question to Djokovic would be 'if you only had one thing you could win in 2025, what would it be?'\" Billie Jean King said to the BBC in November - an echo of the strategy that served the Serb so well in 2024.",

      "The great Australian Ken Rosewall won the last of his eight Grand Slam singles titles at the 1972 Australian Open, having turned 37 two months earlier.",
      "He remains the oldest winner of a major singles title in the Open era. Djokovic is already six months older than Rosewall was then, and the game is now more physically demanding.",
      "Rafael Nadal won his final Grand Slam title two days after his 36th birthday, while Roger Federer was also 36 when he won his final major in Melbourne.",
      "History is against Djokovic, but that has not stopped him in the past. By way of encouragement, remember that Federer had two championship points to beat Djokovic in the 2019 Wimbledon final, which took place a month before the Swiss' 38th birthday.",
      "Djokovic has suggested he will play more tournaments this year, which should help. He was beaten by Reilly Opelka in the Brisbane International quarter-finals but had five matches in all, including a couple of doubles appearances alongside Nick Kyrgios.",
      "'Chasing records is motivation enough'",
      "Jannik Sinner is 23, and Alcaraz 21. That is a lot of years to concede when your opponents are as good as they are.",

      "The Swede was part of Roger Federer's coaching team in 2014 and 2015, and is sure Djokovic's fire still burns brightly.",
      "\"These guys have a lot of people around them and they just love being out there. Especially with Novak chasing a lot of records, I think that's motivation enough,\" he said.",
      "\"He's still extremely fit, so that's going to give him at least a chance, even if it's going to be really difficult this time round.\"",
      "What is clear when speaking to Edberg is how the top players now feel no psychological barrier to winning in their thirties. While the length of the season remains brutal, he says smarter scheduling helps.",
      "\"If I look back on my own career, I think what in many ways burnt me out was playing Davis Cup,\" he explained.",
      "\"We went to six Davis Cup finals in a row - it meant playing until December and then starting the season again.",
      "\"That really shortened my career when I look back at it. Physically, I could have played for another five years.",
      "\"At the time I was playing, the chance of winning Slams at 30 or 31 was very, very poor. That has changed now.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 16:40:28 GMT",
    "summary": "John Mahama was elected on his pledges to solve the economic crisis but won't find it easy, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana's former President John Mahama won last month's elections by a landslide but he will be under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of voters as he assumes office.",
      "After more than three years of economic misery, Ghanaians want a quick fix.",
      "Mahama promised to create jobs and tackle corruption but that will be easier said than done.",
      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "Mahama defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "His party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), also managed to land an overwhelming majority in parliament, securing 183 seats out of 276.",
      "They are one seat short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass laws and approve budgets and contracts without the vote of MPs from the other side of the political divide.",
      "The result of one parliamentary seat is yet to be declared because of discrepancies. Four other seats are being challenged in court by the NDC.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bawumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "However, during his state of the nation address on Friday, outgoing President Nana Akufo Addo said he was leaving behind a recovered economy.",
      "\"We are handing over the country with gross international reserves of almost $8bn (\u00a36.4bn). This is more than the $6.2bn my administration inherited in 2017,\" he said.",
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has disbursed about $1.9bn to support the country's economic recovery since Ghana signed onto the programme in 2022.",
      "However, opposition MPs disagree with Akufo Addo's assessment.",
      "\"The people of Ghana have already given their verdict on the true state of the nation and that verdict was very clear. Economic hardship, huge debt overhang, high youth unemployment, hopelessness and more,\" said minority MP Emmanuel Armah Kofi Boah.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama was flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the IMF - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "Prof Bokin believes that complete economic recovery and growth will take a long time.",
      "He said: ''If you're talking about economic transformation and inclusive productivity growth, you're looking at probably 15 years and beyond of doing the right things conistently.",
      "\"In Ghana we are unable to do the right thing consistently for long. We do the right things in between elections and then we mess up.''",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mahama has already set up what he calls Operation Recover All Loot (Oral), aimed at investigating state funds and assets allegedly stolen by outgoing government officials.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",

      "Exactly 10 years after the jihadist gun-attack that killed most of its editorial staff,  France's Charlie Hebdo has put out a special issue to show its cause is still kicking.",
      "Things changed for France on 7 January 2015, marking in bloodshed the end of all wilful naivety about the threat of militant Islamism.",
      "Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into a meeting at the Paris office of the satirical weekly, murdering its star cartoonists Cabu, Wolinski, Charb and Tignous.",
      "Overall, 12 people were killed by the brothers, including a Muslim policeman on duty outside. Two days later they were cornered and shot dead by police at a sign-making business near Charles-de-Gaulle airport.",
      "That same day saw Amedy Coulibaly \u2013 a one-time prison associate of Cherif \u2013 kill four Jews in a synchronised hostage-taking at a supermarket in eastern Paris. Coulibaly \u2013 who was then shot dead by police \u2013 had killed a policewoman the day before.",
      "A decade on, Charlie Hebdo continues to bring out a weekly edition and has a circulation (print and online combined) of around 50,000.",
      "It does so from an office whose whereabouts are kept secret, and with staff who are protected by bodyguards.",
      "But in an editorial in Tuesday's memorial edition, the paper's main shareholder said its spirit of ribald anti-religious irreverence was still very much alive.",
      "\"The desire to laugh will never disappear,\" said Laurent Saurisseau \u2013 also known as Riss \u2013 a cartoonist who survived the 7 January attack with a bullet in the shoulder.",
      "\"Satire has one virtue that has got us through these tragic years \u2013 optimism. If people want to laugh, it is because they want to live.",
      "\"Laughter, irony and caricature are all manifestations of optimism,\" he wrote.",

      "One contains the image of a cartoonist asking himself: \"Is it okay to draw a picture of a man drawing a picture of a man drawing a picture of Muhammed?\"",
      "The Charlie Hebdo and Hypercacher attacks appear now as the overture to a grim and deadly period in modern France, during which \u2013 for a time \u2013 fear of jihadist terrorism became part of daily life.",
      "In November 2015, there followed gun attacks at the Bataclan theatre and nearby bars in Paris. In the following July, 86 people were killed on the promenade in Nice.",
      "Some 300 French people have died in Islamist attacks in the last decade.",
      "Today the frequency has fallen sharply, and the defeat of the Islamic State group means there is no longer a support base in the Middle East.",
      "But the killer individual, self-radicalised over the Internet, remains a constant threat in France as elsewhere.",
      "The original pretext for the Charlie Hebdo murders \u2013 caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad \u2013 are now strictly off-limits to publications everywhere.",
      "In 2020, a French teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded outside his school by a jihadist after he showed one of the Charlie cartoons in a discussion over freedom of speech.",
      "And this week the trial opens in Paris of a Pakistani man who \u2013 a short time before Paty's murder \u2013 seriously injured two people with a butcher's cleaver at the Paris offices he thought were still being used by Charlie-Hebdo (in fact they had long since moved).",
      "So as with every anniversary since 2015, the question once again being asked in France is: what - if anything - has changed?  And what - if anything - survives of the great outpouring of international support, whose clarion call in the days after the murders was Je suis Charlie?",
      "That was when a march of two million people through the centre of Paris was joined by heads of state and government from countries all over the world at the invitation of then President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.",
      "Today, pessimists say the battle is over and lost. The chances of a humorous newspaper ever taking up the cudgel against Islam \u2013 in the way that Charlie Hebdo used regularly and scabrously to do against Christianity and Judaism \u2013 are zero.",
      "Worse, for these people, is that parts of the political left in France are also now clearly distancing themselves from Charlie Hebdo, accusing it of becoming overly anti-Islam and adopting positions from the far-right.",
      "Jean-Luc Melenchon, who leads the France Unbowed party, has accused the weekly of being a \"bag-carrier for (right-wing magazine) Valeurs Actuels\", and the Greens' Sandrine Rousseau said Charlie Hebdo was \"misogynistic and at times racist\".",
      "This has in turn led to accusations aimed at the far-left that it has betrayed the free-speech spirit of Je suis Charlie in order to curry electoral support among French Muslims.",
      "But speaking in the run-up to the anniversary, Riss \u2013 who counted the dead among his greatest friends and says he does not go through a day without reliving the moment of the attack \u2013 refused to renounce hope.",
      "\"I think [the Charlie spirit] is anchored more deeply in society than one might think. When you talk to people, you can see it's very much alive. It's a mistake to think it's all disappeared.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",
      "In addition to his ex-wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.",

      "Oprah Winfrey selected Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\" as her latest book club choice. The book encourages readers to find peace and purpose and makes history as the first book to be chosen twice. Read a free excerpt below.",
      "Chapter One",
      "The Flowering of Human Consciousness",
      "EVOCATION Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower probably did not survive for long, and \ufb02owers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread \ufb02owering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet\u2014if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.",
      "Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call \ufb02owers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, \ufb02owers were most likely the \ufb01rst thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the \ufb02owers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a \"silent sermon\" once during which he held up a \ufb02ower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.",
      "Seeing beauty in a \ufb02ower could awaken humans, however brie\ufb02y, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The \ufb01rst recognition of beauty was one of the most signi\ufb01cant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, \ufb02owers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more \ufb02eeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word \"enlightenment\" in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon \ufb02owers as the enlightenment of plants.",
      "Any life-form in any realm\u2014mineral, vegetable, animal, or human\u2014can be said to undergo \"enlightenment.\" It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.",
      "What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.",
      "Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didn't become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.",
      "Since time immemorial, \ufb02owers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special signi\ufb01cance for the human spirit. Like all life forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special signi\ufb01cance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and af\ufb01nity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.",
      "Once there is a certain degree of Presence, of still and alert attention in human beings' perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.",
      "In the case of a \ufb02ower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more there than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an af\ufb01nity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form ob- obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life forms. The exception to this are all newborn life forms\u2014babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet \ufb01rmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.",
      "So when you are alert and contemplate a \ufb02ower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three \"en-lightened\" life forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus \ufb02ower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signi\ufb01es the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.",
      "THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK",
      "Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner \ufb02owering so radical and profound that compared to it the \ufb02owering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale re\ufb02ection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of material-ism and materiality and rise above identi\ufb01cation with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to im- imprisonment within their own personality?",
      "The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers\u2014Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known\u2014were humanity's early \ufb02owers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread \ufb02owering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.",
      "Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:36:34 -0500",
    "summary": "An increasingly popular symphony orchestra concert is a screening of a movie such as \"Jaws\" accompanied by a live performance of the music\u2014reeling in new audiences to the concert hall.",
    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",
      "\"You're a mixologist as well?\"",
      "\"Oh, I can hook it up.\"",
      "\"Okay. What can you not do?\"",
      "\"Keep my mouth shut!\" he laughed. \"I need to learn that one!\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I've spent quite a lot of my life over the last 15 years in the really honored, privileged position of being close to people who are reaching the end of their lives,\" said actress Tilda Swinton. \"And then to make a film about it is a blessing on a blessing, really.\"",
      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",
      "I asked, \"You think about specific people as you're acting?\"",
      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed. It was her listening face that I felt was the right face.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Room Next Door\" click on the video player below:",
      "Swinton has made more than 80 films, winning an Oscar for the 2007 \"Michael Clayton.\" Still, she says the big studio productions are the exception. She veers toward independent films, thriving in the experimental.",
      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",
      "\"That's what I'm really interested in!\" she laughed.",
      "She's played a tortured mother in \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" and she's not exactly cuddly in the Almod\u00f2var film. But just before our interview, joking about some fabulous boots she was wearing, we glimpsed another side of Swinton.",
      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",
      "\"I know! It's strange, isn't it? But I think what makes me most shy is being singled out.\"",
      "So, when she's alone on the red carpet, she finds that ensemble approach through fashion.\u00a0 \"It's very playful. My relationship with fashion is entirely dependent on my relationship with certain individuals who are my friends, who happen to be some of the greatest designers in the world, who give me clothes. And that makes going out into a public arena when you are someone who is not an extrovert, not only much easier, but actually possible.\"",
      "When we met in Paris. Swinton had just flown in from a trip to China for Chanel. She was wearing a military coat: \"I first fell in love with my father's uniforms. My mother was always in some nice silk dress, but I was really interested in my father's uniform.\"",
      "Swinton grew up the daughter of a military officer in an aristocratic family in Scotland. When we met, Swinton was looking forward to getting home to her remote seaside town in Scotland, where she raised twins, and has an artist-partner, Sandro Kopp, and a number of springer spaniels.",
      "I asked about descriptions of her as \"an icon of androgynous beauty,\" and naturally radiating \"a certain otherworldliness.\"",
      "\"The otherworldliness does make me laugh a bit,\" she said, \"because the truth is I look like the members of my family. I think the otherworldly might have something to do with the fact that I don't wear mascara and I'm very pale. As my grandmother would say, it would be a dull world if everybody felt the same. I don't feel otherworldly. I feel very much present.\"",
      "Swinton is very much present, whether at an interview or as an actor. And in navigating Hollywood, those roots in Scotland help her find balance.",
      "\"Maybe it's made me braver,\" she said. \"Maybe I wouldn't be able to pack that small bag and engage in worlds that are very alien to where I come from, if I didn't know I was going home to something that feels absolutely real to me.\"",

    "summary": "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu in the first death in the U.S. caused by the H5N1 virus.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",

      "Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.",
      "HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.",
      "HMPV infections are reportedly surging in China, drawing interest around the world, but Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told CBS News this week that there was no concern over a potential new pandemic.",
      "\"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity,\" she said, adding that the virus was fairly stable, unlike the COVID-19 virus that mutates often, making it harder to fight.",
      "India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",
      "\"Health experts have clarified that the HMPV is not a new virus; it was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years,\" Indian Health Minister J. P. Nadda said Monday. \"The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry.\"",
      "Nadda said the people infected in India had no recent travel history and that the government was \"closely monitoring the situation in China and neighboring countries.\"",
      "The Health Ministry also said the HMPV infections were \"no cause of concern,\" as there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses detected in the country, and it noted that India was well prepared for any surge should it occur.",
      "\"The virus infection is usually a mild and self-limiting condition and most cases recover on their own,\" the ministry said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "Health agencies, such as the United Nations' World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have not voiced any concern over the HMPV infections in Asia.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for the first time setting guidelines for levels of lead in processed baby foods such as jarred fruits and vegetables.",
      "Part of an effort to reduce exposure to a toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological issues in children, the action announced on Monday offers only voluntary \u2014 not mandatory \u2014 limits for food manufacturers. But the agency can take enforcement action if it finds foods that surpass its recommended limits.",
      "The FDA guidance caps lead levels for children younger than 2 at 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings, and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals.",
      "The directive covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes. By contrast, the new limits don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, despite some research indicating the products have higher levels of lead. It also doesn't limit other metals like cadmium that have been found in baby foods.",
      "\"FDA's actions today are a step forward and will help protect children,\" said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"However, the agency took too long to act and ignored important public input that could have strengthened these standards.\"",
      "Between October 2023 and April 2024, more than 560 children fell ill after consuming\u00a0lead-tainted apple cinnamon puree, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amount of lead detected in those products were more than 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum allowable limit.",
      "Exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to harmful neurological effects like learning and behavior disabilities and lowered IQ. For adults, chronic lead exposure is linked to kidney dysfunction, hypertension and neurocognitive effects.",

    "story": [
      "Emergency room visits with influenza are now \"very high\" nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, in this week's update on the winter respiratory virus season.",
      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",

      "Unpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from getting mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding whether to issue a loan.",
      "The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be \"lifechanging\" for millions of families, \"making it easier for them to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan. ... Our historic rule will help more Americans save money, build wealth, and thrive.\"",
      "\"No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency,\" she said.",

      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",

Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

      "Further, Experian reinserts inaccurate information into credit reports because it fails to match newly reported information with records of previously deleted information.

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:07:03 -0500",
    "summary": "After reaching a tentative deal that suspended a short strike in October, unionized dockworkers and port operators face another crucial test.",
    "story": [
      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",
      "While that strike ended after three days with a tentative deal between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) that addressed some key issues, the sides face a January 15 deadline to resolve other concerns.",
      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0in March. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",
      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Healthcare, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

      "\"That's a big deal in middle-class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did,\" the president added.",
      "Those beneficiaries will also receive a lump sum in the thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024, the president said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",

House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",
      "Long, hard road",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been decades in the making, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",

      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees.",
      "International Association of Fire Fighters General President Edward Kelly in a statement Sunday said Congress \"broke a promise\" when it enacted the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",

      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "\"The law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned,\" Mr. Biden said after signing the bill into law.",
      "That said, the new law does not address the \"tremendous financial impact on the trust funds and the challenging [Social Security Administration] implementation procedures that will be required,\" said Martha Shedden, president of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts.",

      "Airlines must either offer passengers a choice between a refund or rebooking on another flight if their original flight is canceled, said airline compensation expert Ivaylo Danailov of\u00a0SkyRefund\u00a0in an email.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 11:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis within three years, a report found.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Adams was researching health insurance options in 2023, he had one very specific requirement: coverage for prosthetic limbs.",
      "Adams, 51, lost his right leg to cancer 40 years ago, and he has worn out more legs than he can count. He picked a gold plan on the Colorado health insurance marketplace that covered prosthetics, including microprocessor-controlled knees like the one he has used for many years. That function adds stability and helps prevent falls.",
      "But when his leg needed replacing last January after about five years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "Coverage disparity among plans",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity.\u00a0In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "An estimated\u00a02.3 million\u00a0people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting company. That number is expected to as much as\u00a0double\u00a0in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "\"Insurance fairness\" laws",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about\u00a0half\u00a0of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following three years.",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric\u00a0hand\u00a0she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said."

      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress.",
      "Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to\u00a0hold\u00a0a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change.",
      "Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "Benton said she was told by a congressional staffer that Mr. Biden would sign the bill into law on Monday.",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate the reduction of Social Security benefits while entitled to public pensions from work not covered by Social Security,\" the Social Security Administration stated in an\u00a0update\u00a0Thursday. \"The Social Security Administration is evaluating how to implement the Act if signed into law. We will provide more information as soon as available.\"",
      "Americans who previously filed for Social Security benefits that are partially or completely offset do not need to take any action other than to verify that the Social Security Administration has their current mailing address and direct deposit information.",
      "\"Most people can do this online with their personal my Social Security account without calling or visiting Social Security. Visit\u00a0www.ssa.gov/myaccount\u00a0to sign in or create your account,\" the agency advised.",
      "Workers with a public pension who are interested in filing for Social Security benefits can file online at ssa.gov or schedule an appointment, it added.",

      "While \"Breaking Bad\" certainly has left its mark on New Mexico and this quiet block in Albuquerque, the listing is sure to reignite interest.",
      "Time to move on",
      "Fans often flock to the home, sometimes with hundreds of cars driving by in a single day, Joanne Quintana\u00a0told Albuquerque television station KOB-TV.",
      "Quintana said her parents purchased the home in the 1970s and that she and her siblings grew up there. As her parents got older and the show's popularity skyrocketed, it became harder to protect them. The family was forced to put up a metal fence and install security cameras to keep fans at bay.",

      "\"This was our family home from 1973, almost 52 years,\" she told the station. \"So we're going to walk away with just our memories. It's time to move on. We're done. There's no reason to fight anymore.\"",

    "summary": "The Biden administration blocked the purchase of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Here's what that could mean for the once iconic American company.",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration's move on Friday to\u00a0block Nippon Steel's proposed purchase\u00a0of U.S. Steel raises questions about the once iconic American company's future, with industry sources saying the manufacturer could struggle to energize growth or attract rival acquisition bids.",
      "President Biden stopped the $15 billion deal over national security and supply-chain concerns.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt blasted the decision, calling Mr. Biden's action \"shameful\" and \"corrupt\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk,\" Burritt said.",
      "Burritt added that the proposed deal \"is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities and our country.\"",
      "Limited options",
      "Industry experts said that without outside investment from Japan, the U.S-based steel manufacturer's path forward is murky.",
      "\"With foreign ownership seemingly off the table, we see limited avenues moving forward,\" Bill Peterson, metals and mining analyst for JPMorgan said in a research note.",
      "U.S. Steel leaders had warned that without an infusion of capital from Nippon Steel, it would be forced to curtail its legacy blast furnace investments and shift to cheaper nonunion electric arc furnaces. Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "The company could still entertain bids from domestic rivals, said Peterson, noting that U.S. Steel's mini-mill assets could be attractive to peers like steel products company Nucor Group, which considered buying parts of U.S. Steel before dropping out over price concerns.",
      "Others see rival bids as unlikely.",
      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",
      "Challenges from both sides",
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",
      "\"I think they have Federal Trade Commission issues in terms of monopolistic practices when it comes to companies merging,\" said corporate adviser Jay McDonald.",
      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",
      "\"One nice thing about the Nippon deal was we had a new entrant to the market buying assets, as opposed to continued consolidation in which you eventually get an oligopoly if the steel mills here continue to buy each other up,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If U.S. Steel can't turn around unprofitable plants, it may have no choice but to close them, Flack said, describing the company's future as uncertain.",
      "\"Blocking this deal doesn't serve anyone \u2014 customers, shareholders, workers or national security,\" he said, while adding, \"It will be challenged in court and we have a new administration coming in, so story is not written yet.\"",

CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",

The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",

The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company.

U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",

    "summary": "JetBlue is the first carrier to be penalized by the Department of Transportation for unrealistic scheduling practice.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Friday announced a $2 million fine against JetBlue for \"operating multiple chronically delayed flights,\" marking the first such penalty by the federal agency.",
      "Airlines are prohibited from offering unrealistic schedules that don't reflect actual flight departure and arrival times, yet an investigation by the DOT found that JetBlue operated four chronically delayed flights at least 145 times between June 2022 through November 2023, according to the DOT.",
      "Each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months or more. Despite DOT warning JetBlue about inaccurate flight departure and arrival times on its flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, the airline continued to operate three more repeatedly delayed flights between Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida and JFK; and between Fort Lauderdale and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the agency said.",
      "There were 395 delays and cancellations across these four chronically delayed flights in total, and the DOT's investigation found\u00a0 JetBlue responsible for more than 70% of its chronically delayed flights.",
      "JetBlue said it had invested tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays over the past two years, and had seen significant improvements in 2024.",
      "\"While we've reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four flights in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation's air traffic control system,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Consumers advocates applauded the government's move to penalize JetBlue.",
      "\"Airlines often don't allow enough time between flights and they often allow for no margin for error,\" Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said in a statement. \"They often treat travelers like seat numbers, not people who have lives and commitments and plans for everything from vacations to weddings or funerals.\"",
      "What counts as a chronic delay?",
      "The agency has ongoing investigations into other airlines for unrealistic flight schedules that do not reflect actual departure and arrival times. A flight is considered chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50% of the time, with cancellations included as delays, it stated.",
      "The penalty comes as the Biden administration winds down, leaving uncertain how the incoming Trump regime will tackle transportation issues. Under Biden, transportation regulators have taken a series of actions to safeguard airline passengers, including passing rules that now provide automatic refunds when flights are significantly delayed or canceled.",
      "\"Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",

The future compensation must be a minimum of $75 for each affected passenger.",
      "JetBlue had one of the poorest on-time performances last year among the U.S. airlines, according to a ranking by Cirium. The aviation analytics firm found that less than 75% of JetBlue's flights arrived on schedule, putting the airline behind all the major domestic carriers, including some of its low-cost rivals.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government will issue refunds to tens of thousands of unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens who applied for a Biden administration program that was struck down in federal court, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, plans to refund the $580 application fee that roughly 94,000 people paid in hopes of benefiting from the Biden administration policy, dubbed Keeping Families Together. The refunds amount to about $55 million, the documents show.",
      "Announced in June by President Biden, the initiative offered an estimated half a million unauthorized immigrants a chance to get temporary legal status and a streamlined path to permanent residency, if they were married to U.S. citizens and had lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes. But a federal judge halted the policy almost immediately after it took effect in late August, agreeing with Republican-led states that argued the program flouted U.S. immigration law.",
      "Even if the initiative had survived the legal challenge mounted by Republican state officials, it still would've been in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised to reverse Biden administration immigration policies and oversee mass deportations.",
      "The Keeping Families Together policy was designed to help some longstanding unauthorized immigrants, a population progressive activists argued had been ignored amid the Biden administration's focus on handling the record numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.",
      "While marrying a U.S. citizen generally leads to a green card, American immigration law requires those who entered the country illegally to leave and reenter legally to qualify for permanent residency. Undocumented immigrants, however, can be banned from the U.S. for 10 years upon leaving if they have lived in the country unlawfully for a certain period of time.",
      "The program would have allowed eligible applicants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country, by granting them an immigration classification known as parole that effectively cancels out an illegal entry and provides temporary work permits.",
      "In addition to the spouses of American citizens, the program would have also benefited an estimated 50,000 undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens.",
      "Reached for comment, USCIS confirmed it would close pending applications and issue refunds to applicants.",
      "\"The court order vacating the [Keeping Families Together] process has resulted in requestors paying a fee for an immigration benefit request that, through no fault of their own, cannot be considered,\" the agency said in a statement, noting it determined the refunds were \"in the public interest and consistent with applicable law.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House approved its first policy legislation of the new Congress on Tuesday with a bill aimed at addressing illegal immigration.",
      "The Laken Riley Act\u00a0would require the Department of Homeland Security to take into custody undocumented immigrants who have been charged with theft and other crimes. The legislation is named for Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",
      "\"As promised, we're starting today with border security,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said ahead of the vote Tuesday, adding that lawmakers have \"a lot to do there to fix it\" and noting that the Laken Riley Act \"is a big part of that.\"",
      "In a 264 to 159 vote, the House approved the measure, with all voting Republicans and 48 Democrats supporting its passage.",
      "The legislation also includes a provision that would empower state attorneys general who claim their state or its residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The House approved the legislation in March, with 37 House Democrats joining Republicans in support of its passage. But the bill stalled in the then-Democratic-controlled Senate.",

      "\"We're going to detain and deport illegal aliens who commit burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, certainly vicious and violent crimes, and I can't believe anybody would be opposed to that,\" Johnson said.",

Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said ahead of the vote Tuesday that \"the murder of Laken Riley was an unspeakable and appalling crime,\" but he called the bill \"an empty and opportunistic measure.\" Raskin said the legislation \"fails to address any of the real issues at stake,\" while criticizing Republicans for walking away from a bipartisan border security deal last year when President-elect Donald Trump \"aggressively tanked\" the legislation.",
      "The Maryland Democrat argued that the bill would upend decades of policy by requiring that an undocumented immigrant be detained \"even if they are never convicted or even charged with a crime,\" calling it a \"radical departure\" from current law.",
      "Still, this time around, the bill is seeing more bipartisan support. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania became the first Senate Democrat to sign on as a cosponsor in the GOP-controlled upper chamber this week, where a vote is expected on Friday.",
      "\"Laken Riley's story is a tragic reminder of what's at stake when our systems fail to protect people,\" Fetterman said in a statement, noting that while he says immigration \"makes our country great,\" he's supportive of giving authorities tools to \"prevent tragedies like this one while we work on comprehensive solutions to our broken system.\"",

    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The federal judge overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's now-dismissed case related to classified documents in Florida has temporarily blocked the Justice Department from releasing special counsel Jack Smith's report. Read the latest here.",
      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to remove special counsel Jack Smith from his post and either decline to release Smith's upcoming report detailing his investigations into the president-elect or hand over the matter to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released Monday.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his dual investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\" The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his upcoming administration.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump attorneys filed a brief in Florida arguing that the special counsel should be ordered not to transmit his report on the documents case to Garland while Trump's emergency motion is pending, and also that Garland should be ordered\u00a0 \"not to issue any aspect of Smith's missive to the public.\"",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The classified documents case was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida who ruled in July 2024 that Garland unlawfully appointed Smith, a finding the Justice Department disputed and was appealing in the run-up to the presidential election. The 2020 election-related charges against Trump were dismissed after Trump was reelected. The special counsel wrote that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Federal regulations dictate that upon the completion of any special counsel probe, the investigative team is to submit a report detailing its findings to the attorney general for review. Garland has previously pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and so far kept to that promise, including after a separate special counsel, Robert Hur, submitted his findings about President Biden's handling of classified records. Mr. Biden's legal team raised objections to the attorney general over characterizations in that report, which were rebuffed by Justice Department officials when the complete findings \u2014 including characterizations of Mr. Biden's age \u2014 were publicly released.",
      "Smith has been working on a final report to be completed before Trump's inauguration, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Following its submission, the special counsel is expected to resign as other independent prosecutors have done, the sources said.",
      "In Monday's letter, Trump's attorneys revealed that they reviewed a draft of Smith's report over the last few days at the special counsel's office and raised objections, arguing the preparation of a report would violate federal law related to official appointments and presidential transitions.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote. They also said they would seek legal recourse should Garland deny their requests.",
      "Should Garland opt to hand over the report to Trump's incoming Justice Department for consideration, as the letter suggested, much of the decision-making could fall to the president-elect's current defense team who will hold key leadership positions within the department, and his selection for attorney general, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "The letter to the attorney general was included as an exhibit in a simultaneous effort by Trump's former codefendants in the classified documents case to ask a court to intervene and stop the release of the special counsel's report.",
      "Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira asked Judge Aileen Cannon to stop the release of the report, arguing they would \"suffer harm as civilian casualties\" to the case. The pair were charged alongside Trump as part of an alleged effort to obstruct the classified documents probe. Both men pleaded not guilty and in Monday's letter accused Smith of improper motivations.",
      "While Smith dropped his appeal of the case against Trump citing Justice Department policy, he opted to keep going with the appeal in Nauta and de Oliveira's case in an effort to reverse the legal precedent created by Cannon's ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed.",
      "On Monday, attorneys for the men turned to Cannon, urging her to step in and stop the special counsel from completing his report. They alleged such a move would be improper after the judge had previously dismissed the case. They also contended any public release could affect the ongoing appeal and infringe on the defendants' rights.",
      "\"The Final Report is meant to serve as a Government verdict against the Defendants contrary to all criminal justice norms and constitutional guideposts,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The filing of such a report, by an unauthorized person, is clearly improper in this context and will cause grave harm given the pendency of criminal proceedings, now on appeal, at counsel Smith's own insistence.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment.",
      "The news comes days after a top lieutenant to the special counsel, Jay Bratt, retired from the Justice Department. Bratt, a 34-year federal prosecutor and former head of the Justice Department's counterintelligence section, played a key role in the origins of the classified documents probe and went on to prosecute the case against Trump as part of Smith's team.",
      "While no date has been publicly announced for the release of Smith's report, the defense attorneys asked Cannon to issue a ruling by Friday.",
      "In response to the court filing, the special counsel said that while his team is \"working to finalize\" a two-volume report to hand in to Garland, the attorney general will commit to not releasing it to the public until at least Friday at 10 a.m. to give the court time to rule.",

      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Healthcare, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 06:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Sebastian Gorka failed security screenings during Trump's first term, but could return as White House counterterrorism chief.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be the counterterrorism chief on the White House National Security Council, Sebastian Gorka, is raising concerns among security experts because of his inability to obtain a security clearance early in Trump's first term.",
      "Gorka was forced to depart after seven months, in August 2017, as a lower-level White House staffer after officials were informed that he would not pass his background investigation, sources have confirmed to CBS News.",
      "It is unclear whether the past concerns that led to the denial of his security clearance will impede him from obtaining this new, higher-level post. The job of deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism does not require Senate confirmation, but neither did his position in the first Trump administration.",
      "A Trump transition source told CBS News that Gorka currently \"has an active security clearance with the U.S. government.\" But the transition did not respond to requests to clarify whether the Gorka had been given the customary temporary clearance appointees receive as they are preparing to assume their government position and before they go through the more rigorous FBI background investigation.",
      "Trump has the ultimate authority over who serves on his national security team in the White House, and he can bypass recommendations about clearances. Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump transition, defended Gorka's credentials and told CBS News\u00a0 that \"Dr. Gorka has decades of experience working on matters of national security, irregular warfare, and counterterrorism.\"",
      "Gorka \"will bring a wealth of knowledge and boldness to the National Security Council that will help make America safe again,\" Hughes said.",
      "But some former law enforcement and intelligence officials told CBS News they believe Gorka's past security roadblocks should also be a red flag this time around.",
      "\"Typically when someone has been disqualified at some point, unless there is a grace period to allow them to [enter] the process again to see if the issue can me mitigated, they should not be afforded a position of trust in the government,\" said Stephen Laycock, who served as executive assistant director for the FBI's intelligence branch until 2021.",
      "John Bolton, who was Trump's third national security adviser during his first term and is now a staunch critic of the former president, has said that Gorka should be subjected to a \"full FBI field background investigation\" before assuming the NSC position.",
      "Gorka has been named as Trump's pick for one of the most important jobs in the counterterrorism firmament \u2013 one that would put him at the center of life-and-death decisions involving elite U.S. forces. The role requires access to some of the most sensitive, compartmentalized intelligence in the U.S. government.",
      "In 2017, Trump had named Gorka, a longtime acolyte and Steve Bannon prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to a nebulously defined unit of the National Security Council called the Strategic Initiative Group, a kind of West Wing think tank. John Kelly, Trump's second chief of staff, was perplexed by Gorka's role, three sources who worked in the White House said. At the time, the retired four-star Marine general was focused on imposing discipline on a chaotic White House.",
      "\"He saw people like (Steve) Bannon and Gorka running around the White House with an open loop to the president,\" said one former White House official. When Kelly learned Gorka had been unable to obtain a high-level security clearance for the job, he dismissed Gorka, sources told CBS News.",
      "Why Gorka failed his security screening at that time has not been disclosed, although the review came soon after he was caught by TSA at a security checkpoint carrying a gun into Ronald Reagan National airport. Gorka faced a misdemeanor weapons charge, which was eventually dismissed.\u00a0 Gorka, British-born to Hungarian parents, also was denied clearances to serve on a panel in 2002 that was investigating the then-Hungarian prime minister's past as a member of the Soviet-era Communist secret police, Buzzfeed News reported in 2017.",
      "A firebrand and MAGA crusader, he endeared himself to Trump as a White House aide during his first term with his frequent cable TV appearances defending the administration's most controversial \"America First\" policies, including the so-called \"Muslim ban.\"",
      "He drew scrutiny for controversial remarks about the Judeo-Christian West being in a civilizational struggle against Islam and for his alleged ties to right-wing Hungarian nationalists. He has also faced questions about his academic credentials (Gorka earned a Ph.D from a relatively obscure Hungarian university and served as an administrative dean at the National Defense University.)",
      "Last month, Gorka was a featured speaker at a MAGA Turning Point USA gathering in Arizona, where he stoked conspiracy theories about last summer's assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"The most charitable thing you can say about it,\" Gorka said ominously, is that \"it was failure by design, failure by design, but we will get to the bottom of it.\"",
      "As NSC counterterrorism chief, at any given moment, Gorka could be interacting with the president, Pentagon officials or the CIA to help coordinate lethal strikes against suspected terrorists or risky hostage rescues, for instance.\u00a0 It would also be within his purview to steer policies that require the support of diplomatic partners.",
      "One former Trump counterterrorism official recalled that during Trump's first term, Gorka was involved in efforts to designate Mexico's drug cartels as a foreign terrorist organization, and he said he expects that Gorka could try to revive that policy push. That redesignation would give the U.S. a stronger legal basis for conducting military operations in Mexico. It was scuttled during the last term over fierce opposition from the State Department.",
      "Some Trump critics told CBS News they are concerned that Gorka's return could signal a less disciplined approach to managing the White House \u2013 in which an array of advisers with competing interests could gain unfettered access to the Oval Office \u2014 recreating some of the pitfalls of Trump's first administration.",
      "\"For Trump, process is anathema and discipline is foreign,\" said Chris Whipple, an author, former \"60 Minutes\" producer and documentary filmmaker whose book, \"The Gatekeepers,\" is a behind-the-scenes study of White House chiefs of staff from Reagan to Trump. \"The only qualification that matters is abject loyalty, period,\" Whipple said. \"And that's why you have people like \u2026 Seb Gorka running around the Oval Office.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 15:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "If approved by a federal judge, the agreement means the military would help thousands of veterans seek honorable discharges.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has reached a historic legal settlement with more than 35,000 gay and lesbian military veterans who were dismissed because of their sexual orientation, and in many cases denied an honorable discharge and the array of services they had earned, CBS News has learned.",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, veterans whose discharge papers reference their sexual orientation as a reason for their separation from the military can now avoid a cumbersome legal process and be re-issued paperwork that eliminates any reference to their sexuality. If they were denied an honorable discharge, they will also be eligible for an immediate upgrade review, the agreement says.",
      "\"When I was discharged because of my sexual orientation, I felt that my country was telling me that my service was not valuable \u2013 that I was 'less than' because of who I loved,\" said Sherrill Farrell, a U.S. Navy veteran who was a plaintiff in the case. \"Today, I am once again proud to have served my country by standing up for veterans like myself, and ensuring our honor is recognized.\"",
      "The settlement, which still must receive approval from a federal judge, would resolve the claims from a group of LGBTQ+ veterans who were kicked out of the military years ago because of their sexual orientation. The veterans filed a federal civil rights suit in August 2023 over the Defense Department's failure to grant them honorable discharges or remove biased language specifying their sexuality from their service records following the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" in 2011.",
      "The class action lawsuit, which was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims the Pentagon's failure to correct this \"ongoing discrimination\" represents a violation of constitutional rights.",
      "It's been more than a decade since the military lifted its longstanding ban on openly gay and lesbian troops. But thousands of those discharged under past discriminatory policies like \"don't ask, don't tell\" are still carrying less than honorable discharges today, depriving them of the full spectrum of benefits including VA loan programs, college tuition assistance, health care and some jobs.",
      "A CBS News investigation has documented the Pentagon's long-running failure to restore honor to the service records of thousands of veterans who were deprived of veterans benefits after their military careers were cut short. A series of reports documented the ways these veterans' often traumatic separation from the military shaped the course of their lives.",
      "The settlement would establish a streamlined process for LGBTQ+ veterans who were discharged honorably but whose dismissal was attributed to their sexual orientation \u2014 enabling them to be re-issued papers that make no reference to it. And for those who were denied an honorable discharge, the Pentagon would commit to a streamlined upgrade review process.",
      "\"This proposed settlement delivers long-overdue justice to LGBTQ+ veterans who served our country with honor but were stripped of the dignity and recognition they rightfully earned due to discriminatory discharge policies,\" said Elizabeth Kristen, a senior staff attorney with Legal Aid at Work, a group that helped file the suit. \"It marks a crucial step in addressing this deep-seated injustice and ensuring these veterans receive the acknowledgment and respect they have long been denied.\"",
      "The Pentagon has issued a series of pledges in the past year to right the wrongs inflicted on gay and lesbian service members in the past year. Both the Pentagon and the Department of Justice declined comment on the proposed settlement when reached Monday.",
      "At the time the civil rights suit was filed, a Pentagon spokesman said the military had made attempts to streamline the upgrade process to a short, two-page application. The department said legal representation was no longer required to apply for a discharge review and that the discharge review boards \"continue to strive to finalize 90% of all cases within 10 months as required by statute.\"",
      "But the lawsuit, prepared by the Impact Fund, Legal Aid at Work and the law firms King & Spalding LLP and Haynes & Boone LLP, called that a \"constitutionally inadequate\" response, saying it placed the burden on individual veterans to spend months or years obtaining old personnel records before they could file the applications. Those reviews would then take months or years to be processed, they alleged.",
      "The lawsuit did not seek monetary damages, though the settlement allows the court to approve a $350,000 payment by the Pentagon to cover the plaintiffs' legal costs.",
      "\"This case is not about damages,\" Jocelyn Larkin, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said at the time it was filed. \"This case is about simply changing that piece of paper because the effect of changing that piece of paper is so incredibly consequential for our clients.\"",
      "While the full scope of past discrimination against gay and lesbian service members remains unknown, Larkin believes the lawsuit could at least help some 35,000 veterans already identified by a Defense Department Freedom of Information Act request, first reported by CBS News in June 2023. The true figure could be significantly higher. According to the most recent data available from the Pentagon, just 1,375 veterans have been granted relief in the form of a discharge upgrade or correction to their record.",

      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",

    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's Parker Solar Probe has beamed home its first detailed update eight days after making a record-breaking approach to the sun, the agency announced.",
      "The spacecraft confirmed its systems and instruments are \"healthy and operating normally,\" NASA said in an update released Thursday, a week after the probe passed within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles of the scorching star.",
      "NASA said scientists at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began receiving more detailed telemetry \u2014 or \"housekeeping data\" \u2014 from the spacecraft on New Year's Day. The update showed that Parker had executed pre-programmed commands and that its science instruments were operational during the record-breaking approach.",
      "\"While Parker Solar Probe was closer to the Sun than any other human-made object in history, it operated just as it was designed to do, and made observations that no one has been able to make before,\" Parker Solar Probe Project Manager Helene Winters said in a statement. \"From the heat shield to the solar array cooling system, there was so much enabling technology required to fly this mission, and to gather data scientists have awaited for decades. Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",
      "Parker, which launched in 2018, has flown through the sun's crownlike outer atmosphere, or corona, and the spacecraft is expected to circle the sun through at least September. The probe's next two close flybys of the sun will occur March 22 and June 19, NASA said Thursday.",
      "Parker is the fastest spacecraft built by humans, and reached a top speed of 430,000 mph at closest approach, according to the Associated Press. The probe is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the AP reported.",
      "Researchers are hopeful that data from Parker will help them learn more about how and where solar winds are formed as well as why the sun's outer atmosphere is hundreds of times hotter than its surface.",

    "summary": "The first meteor shower of 2025 is about to peak. Here's how to watch and where you can see the Quadrantids.",
    "story": [
      "The new year will kick off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is set to peak early on Friday.",
      "The Quadrantids have the potential of 200 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, but most astronomy fans can catch 20-30 meteors an hour under clear, dark skies during the peak, according to NASA. The moon will be a \"mere crescent\" and set early in the night, which should make for good meteor viewing conditions, according to the space agency.",
      "When and where you can see the Quadrantids",
      "The meteor shower will peak in the early morning hours on Friday, according to NASA. While meteor showers last for days, the per hour rate of meteors will be best during the peak and the highest as dawn approaches.",
      "The Quadrantids will be active until Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "NASA advises viewing meteor showers in areas well away from city and street lights. The Quadrantids are best seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and observers in the Northwest and Pacific region will likely have the best viewing opportunities this year.",
      "Those heading outside to catch the celestial show should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing northeast and look up. Be prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Viewers should also bring along a blanket or sleeping bag to help with the chilly January weather.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. They streak through the sky every night, and when Earth encounters many meteors at once, it's called a meteor shower. The meteors heat up as they pass through the atmosphere, making them look like shooting stars.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Quadrantids come from asteroid 2003 EH1 \u2014 a small asteroid that was discovered on March 6, 2003.",
      "The Quadrantids are also known for their bright fireball meteors, with larger explosions of light and color that can last longer than an average meteor streak, according to NASA.",

    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday said the social media company is ending its fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to that of Elon Musk's X.",
      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",
      "Community trust",
      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",

    "story": [
      "The decorated soldier behind the Tesla Cybertruck bombing outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas last week used the artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT to plan the New Year's Day attack, law enforcement said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Army Special Forces Master Sgt. Matthew Livelsberger looked into the amount of explosives he'd need, where to buy fireworks and how to buy a phone without providing identifying information, Kevin McMahill, sheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said during a press conference. McMahill called the use of the generative AI a \"game changer.\"",
      "\"We knew that AI was going to change the game at some point or another in really all of our lives,\" McMahill said. \"This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device.\"",
      "A spokesperson for ChatGPT developer OpenAI told CBS News the company is committed to seeing artificial intelligence used responsibly.",
      "\"Our models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities,\" the OpenAI spokesperson said. \"We're working with law enforcement to support their investigation.\"",
      "Las Vegas law enforcement officials and an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shared other new details during Tuesday's press conference, including new information on what caused the explosion. Police shared video of Livelsberger pouring racing fuel onto the Cybertruck.",
      "\"You'll see a trail of liquid falling from the back of the vehicle,\" Las Vegas Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said.",
      "Officials are still working to determine what exactly detonated the explosion, but said it could have been the muzzle flash from the firearm Livelsberger used to fatally shoot himself.",
      "Koren said a review of a note on Livelsberger's phone showed that Livelsberger believed people were following him. The note, titled \"surveillance\" or \"surveil,\" was more of a journal of activities. It included details on Livelsberger's activities leading up to the bombing, including his purchase of guns and picking up the Cybertruck as a rental.",
      "The log showed Livelsberger had considered carrying out his plot in Arizona at the Grand Canyon's glass skywalk. Koren said investigators don't know when or why Livelsberger changed his plans.",
      "Las Vegas police also said they'd uncovered a six-page document they were reviewing with assistance from the Pentagon. Some of the material in the document may be classified, officials said.",
      "McMahill said investigators also still need to recover information from a laptop, a mobile phone and a smartwatch.",
      "Last week, the FBI said that investigators had determined the bombing was likely a suicide. The FBI said that information uncovered by federal investigators and the Army found that Livelsberger likely had post-traumatic stress disorder, along with family issues and personal grievances that may have contributed to his actions. An Army spokesperson confirmed to CBS News in a statement that Livelsberger had received counseling through its Preservation of the Force and Family program.",
      "Livelsberger did not have a criminal history. He was not on the radar of the FBI or the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department before the explosion, McMahill said. Officials previously said Livelsberger had no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump.",

    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",

Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday, asking the court to prohibit the war tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from moving forward with the plea agreements negotiated last summer. Government attorneys also asked the appeals court to stay the proceedings \u2014 including a plea hearing for the attacks' alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed set for Friday \u2014 while the request is considered.",
      "\"The allegations against the respondents set forth their extensive roles as the counselors, commanders, and conspirators in the murder of 2,976 people, the injury of numerous civilians and military personnel, and the destruction of property worth tens of billions of dollars,\" the filing said, arguing later that \"this Court should issue a writ of mandamus and prohibition to the military commission directing it to recognize that the Secretary validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements with the respondents and prohibiting the military commission from conducting hearings in which the respondents would enter guilty pleas pursuant to the invalid pretrial agreements.\"",
      "Last summer, Mohammed, and two other defendants reached deals that would have enabled them to plead guilty to their alleged roles in the 9/11 attacks in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tried to revoke the deals, saying in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the authority to approve the plea deals instead of a subordinate authority, who accepted the deals.",
      "The judge in the 9/11 case and then a military appeals court ruled against Austin and said he had weighed in too late. Following the decision by the military appeals court, the Defense Department said it was considering its options and whether to go to a higher court, as it now has.",

      "According to the motion filed Tuesday, the plea agreements, which are still under seal, would have the three defendants plead guilty to the seven charges against them that include murder, conspiracy and terrorism as well as an eighth charge, intentionally causing serious bodily injury.",
      "When asked in November about why he had tried earlier in the year to revoke the plea deals, Austin said, \"I thought at that point in time that it was important enough that I should be the person to make the decision on this.

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "Experian does not properly investigate consumer complaints of errors in credit reports, threatening their access to credit, employment and housing, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday.",
      "The agency is suing the consumer reporting conglomerate for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act that requires Experian and other companies take steps to ensure the information they compile is accurate and to investigate consumer complaints.",
      "\"When consumers disputed errors on their credit reports, Experian conducted sham investigations rather than properly reviewing the disputes as required by federal law,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"Credit reporting errors can have serious consequences for a family's finances, and it is critical that credit reporting giants follow the law.\"",
      "Specifically, the CFPB alleges that Experian is harming people by using faulty procedures in receiving information in handling consumer disputes. The company \"routinely and uncritically accepts the original furnisher's response to the disputed information, even when the response was improbable or illogical on its face, or when Experian has other information available that suggests the furnisher is unreliable.\" Experian then fails to inform consumers of its findings, and instead offers confusing and incorrect information, CFPB stated.",
      "Further, Experian reinserts inaccurate information into credit reports because it fails to match newly reported information with records of previously deleted information. Those who disputed the accuracy of an account and thought their report had been corrected instead see the same false information reappear without explanation, the agency found.",
      "The CFPB's lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in California, seeks to stop the company's unlawful conduct and a civil money penalty, which would be paid into the agency's victims relief fund.",
      "Experian dismissed the agency's lawsuit as \"completely without merit\" and said it would prevail in court.",
      "\"We take great steps to ensure we investigate every consumer dispute thoroughly and go above and beyond the requirements of the law,\" the company stated.",
      "Based in Dublin, Ireland, Experian employs 22,500 people in 32 countries. Its North American corporate headquarters is based in Costa Mesa, California.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government will issue refunds to tens of thousands of unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens who applied for a Biden administration program that was struck down in federal court, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, plans to refund the $580 application fee that roughly 94,000 people paid in hopes of benefiting from the Biden administration policy, dubbed Keeping Families Together. The refunds amount to about $55 million, the documents show.",
      "Announced in June by President Biden, the initiative offered an estimated half a million unauthorized immigrants a chance to get temporary legal status and a streamlined path to permanent residency, if they were married to U.S. citizens and had lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes. But a federal judge halted the policy almost immediately after it took effect in late August, agreeing with Republican-led states that argued the program flouted U.S. immigration law.",
      "Even if the initiative had survived the legal challenge mounted by Republican state officials, it still would've been in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised to reverse Biden administration immigration policies and oversee mass deportations.",
      "The Keeping Families Together policy was designed to help some longstanding unauthorized immigrants, a population progressive activists argued had been ignored amid the Biden administration's focus on handling the record numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.",
      "While marrying a U.S. citizen generally leads to a green card, American immigration law requires those who entered the country illegally to leave and reenter legally to qualify for permanent residency. Undocumented immigrants, however, can be banned from the U.S. for 10 years upon leaving if they have lived in the country unlawfully for a certain period of time.",
      "The program would have allowed eligible applicants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country, by granting them an immigration classification known as parole that effectively cancels out an illegal entry and provides temporary work permits.",
      "In addition to the spouses of American citizens, the program would have also benefited an estimated 50,000 undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens.",
      "Reached for comment, USCIS confirmed it would close pending applications and issue refunds to applicants.",
      "\"The court order vacating the [Keeping Families Together] process has resulted in requestors paying a fee for an immigration benefit request that, through no fault of their own, cannot be considered,\" the agency said in a statement, noting it determined the refunds were \"in the public interest and consistent with applicable law.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:07:03 -0500",
    "summary": "After reaching a tentative deal that suspended a short strike in October, unionized dockworkers and port operators face another crucial test.",
    "story": [
      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",
      "While that strike ended after three days with a tentative deal between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) that addressed some key issues, the sides face a January 15 deadline to resolve other concerns.",
      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0in March. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines. Other technologies put to use at\u00a0automated ports\u00a0include AI-powered sensors, so-called digital twins \u2014 or identical, digital\u00a0replicas\u00a0of ports \u2014 and blockchain to automate the recording of transactions and track container locations.",
      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

      "A New York judge on Tuesday rejected President-elect Donald Trump's latest attempt to postpone sentencing in his \"hush money\" criminal case. The hearing remains scheduled for Friday morning.",
      "Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued during a brief hearing Tuesday that a president's immunity from criminal proceedings extends to the transition period, before he takes the oath of office. His team has argued that Trump's election meant Justice Juan Merchan should have had no choice but to dismiss Trump's case and set aside his conviction.",
      "Justice Ellen Gesmer hit back at that idea during Tuesday's hearing, pointing out that it's without legal precedent. Stephen Wu, an attorney for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, called the claim \"baseless.\"",
      "When asked for support for the notion that presidential immunity extends to presidents-elect by Justice Gesmer, Blanche replied, \"There's never been a case like this before, so, no.\"",
      "Gesmer also seemed to question the basis of another argument made by Blanche, that special counsel Jack Smith's decision to end his federal cases against Trump is relevant to the New York case.",
      "\"Neither of those proceedings could have been concluded before your client was inaugurated,\" Gesmer said, \"whereas this proceeding can be concluded.\"",
      "Bragg's office opposes pushing back the sentencing again, which Merchan noted in his most recent order has already been delayed three times. Merchan further pointed out that Trump's efforts to move the sentencing beyond the election had made it inevitable that it would ultimately need to take place in the transition period before inauguration.",
      "Trump is the first former president ever convicted of crimes. A unanimous jury in May concluded he authorized a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star.",
      "Sentencing was first scheduled for July 11, but pushed back after the Supreme Court's landmark decision on presidential immunity. A Sept. 18 date was later postponed in order to avoid interfering with the presidential campaign. When Trump was elected, a Nov. 26 hearing was scrapped as the sides argued over whether to move forward with the case.",

    "story": [
      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Healthcare, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has determined that genocide has been committed by members of the RSF paramilitary force and its allied militias in Sudan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday. The \"Rapid Support Forces\" and its allies are one side in a largely hidden but vicious civil war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in less than two years.",
      "In a statement announcing the U.S. determination that genocide was committed \u2014 and that new sanctions were being imposed as a result \u2014 Blinken called it a \"conflict of unmitigated brutality that has resulted in the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe.\"",
      "Blinken announced sanctions against RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, as well as seven RSF-linked companies based in the United Arab Emirates and an individual accused of helping the RSF procure weapons. As part of the sanctions, Hemedti and his family were barred from entering the United States.",
      "The war has left \"638,000 Sudanese experiencing the worst famine in Sudan's recent history, over 30 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and tens of thousands dead,\" Blinken said.",
      "\"The RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians. The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys \u2014 even infants \u2014 on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,\" Blinken said. \"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "In May 2024, the Human Rights Watch organization said the RSF and its allies could have been guilty of genocide against non-Arab ethnic communities over a specific series of attacks in the western region of Darfur. The RSF has been widely accused of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes since the war broke out.",
      "The International Criminal Court has been investigating ethnic-based killings in Darfur and has said it has \"grounds to believe\" that both the paramilitaries and the Sudanese army have committed unspecified \"Rome Statute crimes,\" which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The ICC's investigation continues.",
      "Why is there a civil war in Sudan?",
      "Fighting broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF in April 2023 after months of tension between the two top generals who had been running the country. The former allies in charge of the SAF and the RSF had been negotiating to fully integrate the RSF into the army before the formation of a new transitional government. Those negotiations broke down and the two sides went to war.",
      "After war broke out, the U.S. government, along with international partners, unsuccessfully tried to broker a peace agreement.",
      "Journalists and aid officials have largely been blocked from traveling to the country to report on the conflict first-hand, but independent researchers say the number of deaths from the war has been vastly unreported.",
      "According to a study published in November by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, an estimated 61,000 people were killed in Khartoum State alone, home to the capital city of the same name, between April 2023 and June 2024.",
      "The study found that more than 90% of those deaths went unrecorded, but the estimated toll was considerably higher than previously believed.",
      "\"Our findings reveal the severe and largely invisible impact of the war on Sudanese lives, especially of preventable disease and starvation, said the report's lead author Dr. Maysoon Dahab, adding that \"the overwhelming level of killings\" in the central Kordofan and western Darfur regions \"indicate wars within a war.\"",
      "\"Today's action is part of our continued efforts to promote accountability for all warring parties whose actions fuel this conflict,\" Blinken said Tuesday. \"The United States does not support either side of this war.\"",
      "What is genocide?",
      "The United Nations adopted the\u00a0Genocide Convention\u00a0in 1948 after the Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany. In it, genocide is defined as any one of a series of acts, \"committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\" Those acts include:",

    "story": [
      "The human metapneumovirus, also known as HMPV, is reportedly surging in China, raising questions about what the illness is and if it's a concern to those in the U.S.",
      "Officials in India have also confirmed cases of HMPV. Seven people there have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research.",
      "Chinese health officials have not confirmed that HMPV is what is driving hospitalizations in the country, and recent reports from China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicate the increase may actually be due to influenza A. But with less public knowledge around HMPV in the U.S., worries of a potential new pandemic have risen \u2014 though experts say there isn't need for alarm.",
      "\"The concern for a pandemic can be put at rest,\"\u00a0Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno,\u00a0Children's Medical Center Plano director of infection prevention and control, told CBS News, adding not only is the virus fairly stable, it's also not a novel virus like COVID-19 was. \"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity against this human metapneumovirus.\"",
      "What is HMPV?",
      "HMPV is a virus that can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus.",
      "The length of illness varies depending on the severity on an individual's case but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "HMPV symptoms",
      "According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include:",
      "CoughFeverNasal congestionShortness of breath",
      "Cough",
      "Fever",
      "Nasal congestion",
      "Shortness of breath",
      "\"Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections,\" the CDC's website notes.",
      "Is HMPV a new virus?",
      "HMPV is not new. It was first discovered in 2001 and is part of the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, according to the CDC.",
      "It may have been circulating even earlier \u2014 for decades or over a century, Garcia Carreno said.",
      "In the U.S., HMPV typically circulates beginning in the winter and lasts until or through spring, the CDC says, and can circulate simultaneously with RSV and the flu during the respiratory virus season.",
      "Is HMPV worse than COVID?",
      "Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern \u2014 it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, HMPV accounts for less than 2% of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week.",
      "For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.",
      "Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\"Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia,\" the clinic's website adds.",
      "HMPV transmission and prevention",
      "HMPV is transmitted through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, compared to flu, RSV and COVID, we don't have a vaccine for human metapneumovirus, so we don't have that advantage of priming over or boosting our immune system to fight these viruses,\" said Garcia Carreno. \"But still, everything else that we learned for COVID can apply to human metapneumovirus.\"",
      "To prevent illness, take similar steps to preventing other respiratory viruses, meaning wash hands with soap and water and avoid close contact with sick people.",
      "\"If somebody's sick, try to avoid crowding so they don't expose everybody, especially the vulnerable people,\" said Garcia Carreno. \"If that person is sick and can not avoid going to a place where other people are, then try to use a mask, use cough and sneezing etiquette and good hand washing.\"",

      "New Delhi \u2014 Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus, often called\u00a0HMPV, with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research.",
      "Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.",
      "HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.",
      "HMPV infections are reportedly surging in China, drawing interest around the world, but Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told CBS News this week that there was no concern over a potential new pandemic.",
      "\"This has been circulating for a while, so people have some immunity,\" she said, adding that the virus was fairly stable, unlike the COVID-19 virus that mutates often, making it harder to fight.",
      "India's federal government asked states on Monday to step up surveillance of respiratory illnesses and spread awareness about how to prevent the transmission of HMPV. Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",
      "\"Health experts have clarified that the HMPV is not a new virus; it was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years,\" Indian Health Minister J. P. Nadda said Monday. \"The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry.\"",
      "Nadda said the people infected in India had no recent travel history and that the government was \"closely monitoring the situation in China and neighboring countries.\"",
      "The Health Ministry also said the HMPV infections were \"no cause of concern,\" as there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses detected in the country, and it noted that India was well prepared for any surge should it occur.",
      "\"The virus infection is usually a mild and self-limiting condition and most cases recover on their own,\" the ministry said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Tuesday.",

      "His daughter took the party's leadership in 2011 and booted him out four years later, seeking to distance her movement from his extremist reputation. RN showed strong gains in last year's European Parliament elections, and became the largest single party in a subsequent general election in France.",

    "summary": "North Korea says it carried out its second missile test in two days \u2014 and this one was hypersonic. It came as U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited the region.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said Tuesday its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.",
      "The North Korean state media report came a day after South Korea's military said it detected North Korea launching a missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launch, conducted weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president, came off a torrid year in weapons testing.",
      "North Korea demonstrated multiple weapons systems last year that can target its neighbors and the United States, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and there are concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine.",
      "North Korea in recent years has flight tested various intermediate-range missiles that, if perfected, could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam. In recent months, Pyongyang has been testing combining these missiles with purported hypersonic warheads to improve their survivability.",
      "North Korea since 2021 has been testing various hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons aim to withstand regional missile defense systems. However, it's unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims.",
      "The North's state media said Kim supervised Monday's launch and that the weapon traveled 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), during which it reached two different peaks of 99.8 kilometers (62 miles) and 42.5 kilometers (26.4 miles) and achieved a speed amounting to 12 times the speed of sound before accurately striking a sea target.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military believes North Korea was exaggerating the capabilities of the system, saying the missile covered less distance and that there was no second peak.",
      "Lee said the test was likely a followup to another hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile test last April and said it would be difficult to use such systems in a relatively small territory like the Korean Peninsula. He said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were continuing to analyze the missile.",
      "Kim described the missile as a crucial achievement in his goals to bolster the North's nuclear deterrence by building an arsenal \"no one can respond to,\" according to the official Korean Central News Agency.",
      "\"The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,\" the agency quoted Kim as saying.",
      "Kim reiterated that his nuclear push was aimed at countering \"different security threats the hostile forces posed to our state,\" but KCNA didn't mention any direct criticism toward Washington, Seoul or Tokyo.",
      "The launches took place while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Tokyo and Seoul for talks with Japanese and South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues.",
      "In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Monday, Blinken condemned North Korea's launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North's weapons programs. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow's war on Ukraine. He described the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a \"two-way street,\" saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and \"intends to share space and satellite technology.\"",
      "According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by Kim's nuclear-armed military.",
      "At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the \"toughest\" anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a \"nuclear military bloc for aggression.\"",
      "North Korean state media didn't specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program.",
      "Even when Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position - built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions - presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.",

      "Musk has accused the United Kingdom leader of being \"complicit in the rape of Britain\" on his X platform and has repeatedly elevated claims without evidence that Starmer knowingly refused to prosecute child groomers when he was the country's top lawyer.",
      "Throughout the past 48 hours alone, Musk has called for Starmer to be imprisoned and posted a poll to his X followers posing the question as to whether \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.\"",
      "While the British leader did not name Musk directly, he widely condemned what he said was the spread of false information.",

      "Musk's barbs are in reference to a years-long scandal in Britain over the state's response to child sexual exploitation and grooming gangs, mostly consisting of Pakistani men, who targeted vulnerable young girls in multiple towns across northern England.",

The report detailed how children as young as 11 years old were subject to trafficking, rape and other forms of physical assault.",
      "That report was heavily critical of \"the collective failures of political and officer leadership\" and said that \"growing evidence that child sexual exploitation was a serious problem in Rotherham\" was ignored and even suppressed by authorities.",
      "Starmer served as director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, a role that in practice made him the top prosecutor in the country when the child grooming scandals came to light.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday he will resign as prime minister and Liberal Party leader amid growing opposition to his leadership.",
      "\"The fact is, despite best efforts to work through it, parliament has been paralyzed for months, after what has been the longest session of a minority parliament in Canadian history,\" Trudeau said in televised remarks outside of his home in Ottawa, Canada's capital city. \"I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process.\"",
      "Trudeau said Canada's parliament will pause until a new leader has been chosen. It will resume in late March, which will allow for a Liberal Party leadership race.",
      "\"This morning, I advised the governor general that we need a new session of parliament,\" he said. \"She has granted this request, and the House will now be prorogued until March 24.\"",
      "Trudeau, a former high school teacher and son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, became prime minister in 2015 after his Liberal Party won a decisive parliamentary majority. The Liberal Party won two more successive elections in 2019 and 2021, but lost the popular vote, requiring him to form a minority government with a left-wing opposition party, leaving his party dependent on allies to pass legislation.",
      "In his press conference on Monday Trudeau  called for a more unified political environment and suggested changes to Canada's election process that would allow voters to look \"for things they have in common instead of polarizing and dividing Canadians against each other.\" He said failing to amend that process during his term is \"one regret particularly\" that he has leading up to the next election.",
      "Why is Justin Trudeau resigning?",
      "Trudeau's leadership has faced significant challenges in the wake of the COVID crisis, leading to a loss of confidence among Canadians from various backgrounds. Key issues such as housing affordability, the rising cost of living and high levels of immigration contributed to widespread disillusionment. This growing frustration led to Trudeau's own Liberal supporters to start calling for his resignation.",
      "Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's abrupt resignation on Dec. 16 further complicated Trudeau's political landscape and threw his Liberal Party into disarray, reviving calls for him to step down.",

      "Asked to address Freeland's departure, which some saw as the catalyst to Trudeau's resignation announcement, the prime minister said he had hoped Freeland would agree to continue in his cabinet as deputy prime minister, \"but she chose otherwise.\" Trudeau declined to share more details about their \"private conversations.\"",
      "Trudeau made a last-ditch effort to shuffle his cabinet, hoping to add some stability to his government, but that failed as well.",
      "The Toronto Star's editorial board said in an op-ed published Dec. 16\u00a0 that Trudeau is \"seemingly more concerned with his own survival than with the national interest,\" urging him to walk away \"for his legacy, his party and his country.\"",
      "The Toronto Police Association also said in a post on social media Dec. 17 that it had lost faith in Trudeau's government, saying it's \"time to resign and leave these critically important public safety issues to someone else.\"",
      "Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party and once an ally of Trudeau, threatened to bring down the Liberals' minority government through a non-confidence vote in the next sitting if he didn't resign.",

      "Since then, the U.S. and South Korea say Kim Jong Un has sent at least 10,000 North Korean soldiers to help shore up Putin's forces, who have been stretched thin after almost three years of intense fighting in eastern Ukraine and, more recently, in Russia's border region of Kursk, which Ukrainian forces invaded late last year.",
      "After North Korea's missile flew around 680 miles before falling into the sea on Monday, Seoul said it had \"strengthened surveillance and vigilance\" for more launches. Seoul was also \"in close coordination with the U.S. and Japan\" about the launch, the South's military added.",
      "U.S., South Korea stress ties amid changing leadership",
      "The test comes two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who in his last term sought to woo North Korea with a unique brand of personal diplomacy.",
      "Blinken reiterated the \"ironclad commitment\" of Washington to defending South Korea and spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and acting President Choi Sang-mok about \"how both sides will work together to further strengthen bilateral cooperation and trilateral cooperation with Japan,\" a State Department statement said.",
      "Until briefly imposing martial law on December 3, Yoon had been a darling of President Joe Biden's administration for his pro-U.S. policies on the global stage. He delighted the United States by seeking to turn the page on decades of friction with Japan, a fellow U.S. ally that is also home to thousands of U.S. troops.",
      "Yoon joined Biden and Japan's then prime minister Fumio Kishida in 2023 for a landmark three-way summit at the Camp David presidential retreat that included a promise to step up intelligence cooperation on North Korea. Choi's office said in a statement that South Korea remained committed to the \"principles and agreements from the Camp David summit.\"",
      "The acting president \"stated that South Korea will continue to maintain its diplomatic and security policies based on a strong Korea-U.S. alliance and trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.\"",
      "South Korea's progressive opposition, which has made Yoon's life miserable from parliament and is increasingly ascendant since the president's power grab, historically has taken a harder line on Japan.",
      "Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung \u2014 who himself faces election disqualification in a court case \u2014 also favors more diplomatic outreach with North Korea than the hawkish Yoon.",
      "The turmoil and lack of a clear leader in Asia's fourth-largest economy comes just as the U.S. is in the midst of its own political transition.",
      "While Mr. Biden has focused on nurturing U.S. alliances, Trump, who takes over on January 20, has been dismissive of what he sees as unfair commitments by Washington. Trump said during his latest presidential run that if he were in power he would have strong-armed South Korea into paying $10 billion a year for the U.S. troop presence, nearly 10 times what it contributes now.",
      "But paradoxically, Trump forged a bond with the last progressive South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, who encouraged his attempts at deal-making with North Korea.",
      "Trump, who once threatened \"fire and fury\" against North Korea, went on to meet three times with leader Kim Jong Un and said they \"fell in love.\"",
      "Blinken says Israel-Hamas truce may not happen under Biden",
      "Blinken voiced confidence Monday that a ceasefire deal in Gaza would come together, but possibly after President Joe Biden leaves office on January 20. Blinken, who tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully last year to broker a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, said the Biden administration would \"work every minute of every day\" until the end of its term to secure a hostage release deal.",
      "\"We very much want to bring this over the finish line in the next two weeks,\" Blinken told reporters in Seoul. \"If we don't get it across the finish line in the next two weeks, I'm confident that it will get its completion at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later. When it does, it will be on the basis of the plan that President Biden put forward and that virtually the entire world supports.\"",
      "Trump has vowed even stronger support for Israel and has warned Hamas of \"hell to pay\" if it does not free the roughly 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza more than a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack. Israeli officials believe about two thirds of the remaining hostages are still alive.",
      "A Hamas official said Sunday that the group was ready to free 34 hostages in the \"first phase\" of a potential deal with Israel, which said that indirect talks had resumed in Qatar.",
      "Blinken said there had been an \"intensified engagement\" by Hamas on reaching a deal, but that it was not yet complete.",
      "\"We need Hamas to make the final necessary decisions to complete the agreement and to fundamentally change the circumstance for the hostages, getting them out, for people in Gaza, bringing them relief, and for the region as a whole, creating an opportunity to actually move forward to something better,\" Blinken said.",
      "Blinken has made 12 visits to the Middle East since the massive Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which saw the group kill some 1,200 people and take 251 others captive.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by immediately launching a relentless military campaign in Gaza, which health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory say has killed more than 45,000 people, decimated all of the enclave's infrastructure and forced virtually all of its residents from their homes.",

      "\"It might also manifest subtly, like overspending on impulse purchases or having trouble waiting your turn in group discussions,\" she said.",
      "2. Difficulty focusing or staying on task",
      "Procrastination and difficulty following through on tasks are common signs of ADHD, Anderson noted.",
      "\"You might struggle to start tasks, even when vital, or abandon them halfway through,\" she said. \"You might jump between tasks without finishing anything or focus on smaller, less urgent tasks while the bigger, more critical ones remain untouched.\"",

      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",
      "Emotional sensitivity often accompanies ADHD, which can manifest as mood swings, irritability or heightened responses to minor frustrations.\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "\"They can provide a proper evaluation and help you explore treatment options, including therapy, medication or lifestyle adjustments,\" Anderson noted.",

      "Benefits of microdosing",
      "The primary reason for microdosing is to reduce costs, according to McGowan.",
      "For example, he said, a patient might think that if a full prescription costs over $250 per week, they may be able to achieve some benefit with just $25 worth of the medication.",

      "The average monthly retail price of Ozempic ranges from $1,000 or more without insurance, per GoodRx.",

      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",
      "\"Microdosing Ozempic or other [weight-loss] medications is entirely off-label and unproven, with no supporting clinical studies,\" he cautioned.",
      "OZEMPIC COULD HELP REDUCE ALZHEIMER\u2019S RISK FOR SOME, STUDY SUGGESTS: \u2018SHIFTING THE PARADIGM\u2019",

      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "People who microdose often use a \"compounded\" version of the medication,\u00a0which the FDA does not regulate.",

      "Without changes to diet and physical activity patterns, the long-term benefits will disappear once the drug is stopped, one doctor noted. (iStock)",
      "Additionally, these compounded versions are usually dispensed in vials, which requires a syringe to draw it up, in contrast to the FDA-approved versions that are simpler to use.",
      "Using the compounded versions through vials runs the risk of drawing up too much medication \u2014 so instead of\u00a0microdosing, it's possible to macrodose, Sowa warned.",
      "Medical supervision is key",

      "To combat misinformation and voter suppression, Zuckerberg detailed measures like partnerships with election officials, the removal of false claims, and warnings applied to over 150 million pieces of content reviewed by independent fact-checkers.

That\u2019s why the makers of iPhones and Android devices have multiple ways you can restore contacts on your phone. Following these easy steps outlined above gives you the ability to rectify that situation quickly. It is best to make sure that your mobile devices are being backed up either to the cloud or physically to a computer or hard drive backup so that there is a source from which to restore your contacts. Additionally, should anything go awry when you're doing the restoration process, you have the ability to recover lost data. Accidents happen, but practicing safe data hygiene prevents them from becoming a lost cause or needing a miracle.",

      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",

These emails often create a false sense of urgency, urging you to click on malicious links. Always verify the sender\u2019s email address and avoid clicking on links without double-checking their authenticity. When in doubt, go directly to the official website rather than using a provided link.",

These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

      "The new Location Sharing toggle",
      "Google has introduced a new \"Google Location Sharing\" toggle that is now integrated directly into the Android settings. This update eliminates the need to navigate through Google Maps to manage your Location Sharing preferences. The new feature is part of the latest updates to Google Play Services and is designed to simplify and enhance your control over location sharing.",
      "What Location Sharing means",
      "Before you toggle this off, let\u2019s take a moment to understand why you might want it on and what happens when you turn it off.",
      "Imagine this: You\u2019re meeting a friend in a busy city, and instead of sending a dozen texts back and forth, they can simply see your real-time location on Google Maps. That\u2019s the power of location sharing. It allows you to share your exact position with specific contacts, along with useful details like your device\u2019s battery level or your estimated arrival time if you\u2019re navigating.",
      "But when location sharing is off, your movements stay private. No one can track where you are, and your personal information is better protected from potential misuse. Apps and services lose access to your location data, which not only boosts your privacy but can also save battery life by cutting down on background tracking.",
      "So, before deciding, think about what fits your needs best: staying connected or staying private.",

Certain Android tablets that support the latest versions of the operating system may also have access to this feature. The Location Sharing toggle is part of recent updates to the Android OS, specifically through Google Play Services. You should ensure your devices are running at least Android 12 or later to access this functionality effectively.",

In May 2024, law enforcement shut down a botnet, a network of hijacked devices, called 911 S5.

      "Here are seven essential steps to help you choose a reliable VPN and safeguard your online privacy.",
      "1. Stick to official app stores:\u00a0Always download apps from trusted platforms like the App Store for iOS or the Google Play Store for Android. These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "3. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement\u00a02FA for your VPN accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.",
      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",
      "5. Use strong encryption: Look for VPN services that use robust encryption protocols like AES-256 to protect your data.",
      "6. Monitor VPN traffic: Continuously monitor VPN traffic and logs for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.",
      "7. Invest in strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it compromises your device. Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection. Look for a trusted name in cybersecurity when choosing an antivirus solution.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

      "Ingenuity's legacy",
      "Ingenuity's journey on Mars far exceeded expectations. Originally designed for just five test flights over 30 days, it ultimately completed an astounding 72 flights in nearly three years. The helicopter served as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover, helping scientists and engineers gather valuable data about Mars' terrain and atmosphere.",
      "Throughout its mission, Ingenuity pushed the boundaries of extraterrestrial flight, reaching a maximum altitude of\u00a078.7 feet, achieving a top speed of 22.4 mph and completing a single longest flight that covered 2,310 feet.",

    "story": [
      "You'll wonder how you functioned without an AirTag.",
      "Apple AirTags can be a great way to outsmart car thieves, but there are some drawbacks to consider. A key limitation is that thieves who also have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are trying to steal. This makes hiding an AirTag tricky.",
      "That\u2019s why we were intrigued by Brian\u2019s inquiry about using other ways to make Apple AirTags undetectable to car thieves or outsmarting them twice.",
      "\"If an AirTag is put in an RFID wallet and hidden in a car, can the AirTag be located by a thief using a locator? I know the AirTag will function in the wallet, but will it be undetectable by the thief?\" \u2014 Brian, LaSalle, Illinois",

      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",
      "Some thieves use RFID readers, which use radio waves, to scan and read data such as credit cards in wallets. The function of RFID wallets and bags is to protect items or devices from these radio waves by blocking them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",
      "A person holding an RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DO EMF BLOCKERS REALLY PROTECT US?",
      "What can block AirTag technology?",
      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Alternatives to AirTags for car security",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

Then, one day, you find out that some company you've never heard of is selling your personal information to whoever wants to buy it. It's not just alarming. It could actually put your financial security at risk.",
      "These companies are data brokers that collect and sell people's personal information, often without us even knowing about it. And get this: Some of them might be trading info that could affect your retirement savings.",

      "How data brokers are endangering your retirement security",
      "There\u2019s one major way in which data brokers are endangering your retirement security, and it\u2019s right there in the name: data brokers buy, sell, trade and otherwise spread your personal information far and wide. This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",
      "In other words, something aimed right at you and very difficult to ignore. Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",
      "Any of the above types of scams can end in what might be the ultimate fraud \u2013 identity theft \u2013 but these three are more likely to get there, and in fewer steps, than the others.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0A trusted personal information removal service\u00a0can stop data brokers in their tracks from sharing your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click on links: No matter how much pressure or stress a message or phone call puts you under, stick to the golden rule of never following or clicking on links. Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",
      "UNDERSTANDING BRUSHING SCAMS AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "4. Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails. Hang up or set the message aside, find the legitimate contact information for the organization in question and reach out through official channels (not social media) to confirm the request.",

As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures.

Its amphibious capabilities allow it to navigate through mud, slush and even dive into rivers, emerging unscathed on the other side.",
      "What sets the RT-G apart is its rapid acceleration. It can hit speeds of about 19 mph in 2.5 seconds, giving it a significant advantage in pursuit scenarios. This quick burst of speed, combined with its ability to handle drops from knee-high ledges and potentially roll down staircases, makes it a persistent and resilient force in the field.",

      "THE FUTURE OF SECURITY JUST ROLLED IN, AND HER NAME IS ATHENA",
      "Advanced technology at its core",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G is equipped with an array of advanced sensors and technologies that make it a sophisticated piece of equipment. These include GPS for precise positioning, multiple cameras and ultrasonic sensors for environmental awareness, obstacle avoidance capabilities and threat and target tracking systems. These features enable the RT-G to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions with people and objects. Additionally, the robot uses gyroscopic self-stabilization to maintain its balance and keep its wide contact patch firmly on the ground, ensuring smooth and quiet operation.",

      "Non-lethal arsenal",
      "For law enforcement purposes, the RT-G comes equipped with a comprehensive range of non-lethal tools designed to manage diverse tactical scenarios. These tools include tear gas dispensers, smoke bomb launchers, high-decibel horns, acoustic crowd dispersal devices and net shooters capable of close-range suspect apprehension.",
      "This sophisticated arsenal allows the robot to handle various situations, from crowd control to individual suspect takedowns, without resorting to lethal force, providing law enforcement with a versatile and humane technological solution.",

      "Real-world application",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G is not just a concept; it's already being put to the test. In Wenzhou, a city in China's Zhejiang province, these robotic spheres are assisting police patrols in commercial zones. This real-world trial is providing valuable insights into the effectiveness and practicality of the RT-G in actual law enforcement scenarios.",
      "However, despite its impressive capabilities, the RT-G is not without its limitations. Video footage shows that the robot can be somewhat unstable when making turns, and its pursuit capabilities may be easily thwarted by a flight of stairs. These challenges highlight the ongoing need for development and improvement in robotic law enforcement technology.",
      "Rotunbot RT-G (Logon Technology)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G's amphibious nature, high-speed capabilities and non-lethal arsenal make it a versatile tool for police forces. However, like any new technology, it raises questions about privacy, surveillance and the increasing automation of policing. The RT-G may be rolling into the future of law enforcement, but we must carefully consider the implications of deploying such advanced robotic systems in our communities.",

      "Henrico police arrested Erin Elizabeth Ann Strotman, a 26-year-old registered nurse, Friday on charges of malicious wounding and child abuse for one of the incidents. Police are investigating six more, including the Hackeys' case and three other reopened cases that were closed without charges last year due to a lack of evidence.",

      "When the hospital said it was closing its NICU on Christmas Eve, he said a friend sent him a news article, and he learned that the attack on his son was not the only incident.

      "Known as a consent decree, the agreement requires that officers \"promote the sanctity of human life as the highest priority in their activities\" and \"carry out their law enforcement duties with professionalism and respect for the dignity of every person.\"",

Our success will only be realized when we all work together on what is arguably one of the most important issues in the life of our city.\"",

A proposal circulating in the media suggested that Egypt and the Palestinian Authority are discussing the creation of a \"technocratic\" body to oversee Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, humanitarian aid and reconstruction. The body would be composed of 12 to 15 Palestinian figures and would be independent of Hamas\u2019s control, potentially signaling a shift in Gaza\u2019s power dynamics.",
      "Officials in Jerusalem have stressed that Israel will maintain security control without re-establishing former settlements in Gaza. \"We will enter whenever we want and conduct military operations to combat terrorism,\" an Israeli security official told Fox News Digital. There is also a desire to involve Arab countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in Gaza's reconstruction.",

      "However, senior IDF officials are warning that without a clear strategic plan for the post-conflict period, the achievements of the military campaign could be undone. A senior IDF official explained that without alternatives to Hamas, the cycle of conflict will continue. \"Unless Israel puts in place a plan for the day after, and grows an alternative to Hamas, the terror group will rebuild itself and remain in power. It\u2019s an endless cycle,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Some Israeli officials believe that the lack of a coherent strategy is tied to the uncertainty surrounding U.S. policy under the upcoming administration. \"The day after is still very far off,\" one official said. \"We were dealing with Lebanon until not long ago, we are dealing with Iran and the Houthis, everything that\u2019s happening in Syria . . . rebuilding Gaza wasn\u2019t a top priority. For sure, the war will not end until hostages are released and Hamas is completely dismantled. And we are all waiting to see how the new Trump administration will want to handle the situation.\"",

      "Several plans for Gaza\u2019s future have been proposed, with differing visions for how Israel should proceed.",
      "Retired Major General Giora Eiland, former head of Israel's National Security Council, has advocated for a more militaristic approach. His \"general plan\" calls for the evacuation of northern Gaza\u2019s population, followed by the encirclement and siege of Gaza\u2019s northern region. By cutting off supplies like water, fuel and food, Eiland believes Hamas will be forced to submit, and the hostages could be freed.",
      "In the long term, Eiland envisions an Israel that controls parts of Gaza but only militarily- with no Israeli citizens entering and no settlements on the ground. Eiland told Fox News Digital, \"If we have control over the northern part of Gaza and Hamas is no longer in power, then we can start the process of rebuilding Gaza with international cooperation.\"",
      "While the approach could weaken Hamas, critics warn it might exacerbate Gaza\u2019s dire humanitarian crisis. One senior security official told Fox News Digital, \"If we carry on like this, we risk an endless cycle of violence. It\u2019s crucial to have a strategic endgame that involves dismantling Hamas but also considering international law.\"",

      "Eiland argues that his strategy aligns with international law and could force Hamas into negotiations. \"When I prepared this plan, I read the manual that is published by the American Department of Defense. Twelve hundred pages of explanation of what American doctrine is in regard to the implementation of international humanitarian law. And according to this manual, all that I propose so far is written explicitly in this manual,\" Eiland added, \"Hamas cares only about two things: humiliation and losing land. If we can make them lose control over land, they will be under real pressure.\"",
      "In contrast, Major General (res.) Amos Yadlin is supportive of a diplomatic solution. \"We proposed a mechanism of Palestinian technocrats who have ties to the Palestinian Authority symbolically, but not practically. These technocrats would be mentored by Arab groups such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Morocco.\"",

      "Yadlin, who is the CEO of the Israeli think tank\u00a0Mind Israel, envisions Gaza\u2019s future being shaped by Arab states. He said they have the necessary influence to stabilize Gaza, after Israel dismantled\u00a0Hamas military infrastructure. \"No one will rebuild Gaza while Hamas remains in control,\" Yadlin told Fox News Digital. \"Hamas can be a political party, based on acceptance of the Quartet conditions from 2017: acknowledging Israel and condemning terror,\" he said.",
      "The IDF said that it finished its operation in the Bani Suheila area of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, destroying infrastructure used by Hamas.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces)",
      "One issue that Yadlin is more pragmatic about, and which is a red line for the current Israeli government, is the role of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza. Israeli officials have made it clear that the PA will not be involved in the post-Hamas governance of Gaza. \"No scenario includes the Palestinian Authority,\" one official said. \"We see its inability in the West Bank and do not want to bring that capability to Gaza.\"",
      "This exclusion of the PA raises questions about Gaza\u2019s future governance and the potential for political stability. While Israel favors a technocratic approach, it remains uncertain whether such a model can function without the involvement of the Palestinian Authority.",

      "In contrast to Trudeau, Poilievre \u2014 the former-Conservative minister\u2019s biography touts him as a \u201clife-long conservative\u201d and \u201cchampion of a free market\u201d \u2014 has sought to present himself as the candidate with the \u201cstrength and smarts to stand up for this country.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CTV News last month, Poilievre said that his first message for the incoming president was \u201cthat first and foremost, Canada will never be the 51st state of the U.S.\u201d \u2014 and Canada, he said, had a \u201cvery proud future ahead of us.\u201d",
      "Tari Ajadi, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal, was less sure. He told NBC News that Poilievre has yet to produce a clear plan on how to tackle the Canada-U.S. relationship under Trump, adding that \u201cI think Canada\u2019s in for a rough ride.\u201d",
      "What happens now?",
      "Even though Trudeau is quitting, Canadians will have to wait for months before they can head to the polls.",
      "An election date has yet to be announced, and while the Canada Elections Act says it must be held on or before Oct. 20, Trudeau's resignation means it's likely that a vote will be called before then.",
      "Before that can happen, the Liberal Party must find a candidate. Trudeau said he would remain at the party\u2019s helm until his party colleagues have undertaken a \"robust, nationwide, competitive process\" to find his successor.",
      "In the meantime, Trudeau said Canada's governor general had accepted his request to prorogue Parliament, suspending proceedings without the dissolution of parliament, until March 24. Then, a confidence vote is expected to be held, with a no-confidence result triggering the next federal election.",
      "That means the Liberal government will remain in power, but parliamentary activity will come to a halt.",
      "Referring to his party's lack of working majority and Canada's legislative gridlock, Trudeau said Monday that \u201cParliament has been paralyzed for months after what has been the longest session of a minority Parliament in Canadian history.\u201d",
      "Who will replace Trudeau?",
      "Trudeau, a former teacher who campaigned with the slogan \"sunny ways,\" took office in November 2015 and enjoyed high popularity ratings early in his leadership with the promise of liberal reforms, progressive tax policies and a focus on gender equality.",
      "His initial appeal was also boosted by the legacy of his father, the charismatic but polarizing Pierre Trudeau, who was one of Canada's longest-serving leaders.",
      "But in recent years, Trudeau's approval ratings plummeted from around 65% in September 2016 to around 22% in December, according to the nonprofit Angus Reid Institute.",
      "According to figures from the Angus Reid Institute, Freeland, a former journalist, is the Liberal candidate most likely to beat Poilievre.",
      "Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney is also a contender, and the Conservatives have sensed that. They have long attacked Carney, with Poilievre dismissing him as \"just like Justin.\"",
      "But regardless of who Trudeau's successor is, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine anyone coming in who can hold on to the government in the next election,\u201d Cornell University government professor Peter Loewen told NBC News.",
      "Dominic LeBlanc, minister of finance and intergovernmental affairs and a longtime friend of Trudeau's, and Foreign Affairs Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly are also potential candidates.",
      "With Trudeau on his way out, the Liberal Party appears to face an existential crisis.",
      "\u201cTrudeau was a singular figure in Canadian politics,\u201d said Ajadi, of McGill University. \u201cThere\u2019s not another Justin Trudeau waiting in the wings.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 22:05:08 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that he wants Canada to join the United States have become a staple of his presidential transition.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that he wants Canada to join the United States have become a staple of his presidential transition. But the sentiment \u2014 like Trump\u2019s breezy confidence about its ease and popularity \u2014 is far from new.",
      "Such talk has sprung up practically throughout the whole of American history, often buttressed by the idea that Canadians were clamoring for it, too.",
      "Amid the War of 1812, President Thomas Jefferson told Philadelphia newspaper editor Thomas Duane that \u201cthe acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching.\u201d (Spoiler alert: It wasn\u2019t.) Among other things, the National Park Service notes in an article about the comment, many in the United States wrongly \u201cassumed that the Canadian population would welcome the arrival of American forces.\u201d",
      "Later in the 1800s, a degree of pro-annexation sentiment developed within each of the major U.S. political parties, according to historian John W. Quist, united by a common thread that annexation of Canada \u201cwould occur peacefully and be welcomed by Canadians.\u201d",
      "And now there\u2019s Trump, posting on social media that \u201cmany people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, he continued the drumbeat at a news conference, telling reporters he could use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to acquire Canada. \u201cThat would really be something,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cYou get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like. And it would also be much better for national security.\u201d",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said afterward on X: \"There isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\"",
      "Public opinion polling of Canada illustrates a distinct political culture that\u2019s far different from the United States.\u2019",
      "A September poll from the Environics Institute showed Canadians preferring Vice President Kamala Harris to Trump by a 3-to-1 ratio before the election, though Trump fared better than Joe Biden in the same measure four years ago, especially among younger Canadians. (The poll did show a plurality of Canadian Conservatives preferring him this time, which was not the case in 2020.)",
      "Canadians generally have had favorable opinions about the United States over the last quarter-century, according to Pew Research Center surveys \u2014 but they were never lower than when Trump was president, dipping to 35% favorable in 2020 before they rebounded after Biden\u2019s election. The Environics Institute\u2019s polling shows a similar trend.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of Canadian politicians and parties supporting annexation by the United States have sprung up over the years \u2014 but those movements have quickly evaporated without gaining much more than a whisper of public support.",
      "And as Montreal Gazette columnist Allison Haines noted in 2018 in writing about one of those quixotic endeavors, the likes of Quebec \u201cwould be a very odd fit as the 51st state,\u201d with approval for things like universal health care deeply embedded in Canadian political culture (though some polls have shown rising interest in reform in Canada) while they remain hot-button issues of debate in the United States.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that the last time the idea of adding new states was in the public sphere, then-Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others in the GOP were quick to warn about the potential political consequences of adding more Democratic senators. The Environics Institute poll, translated into hypothetical votes, would add millions of anti-Trump voters to the country.",
      "In short, Trump\u2019s rhetorical dreams of a no-brainer match are far more complicated in reality. But he is not alone in U.S. history in skating past those trivialities to talk of new frontiers in manifest destiny."

    "summary": "NASA on Tuesday announced an overhaul to its plan to collect samples from Mars and return them to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "NASA has announced an overhaul to its plan to bring samples from Mars back to Earth. Agency officials have decided to scrap parts of their original plan to cut down on the difficulty and cost.Instead, NASA plans to pursue two alternative options simultaneously.",
      "NASA has announced an overhaul to its plan to bring samples from Mars back to Earth.",
      "Agency officials have decided to scrap parts of their original plan to cut down on the difficulty and cost.",
      "Instead, NASA plans to pursue two alternative options simultaneously.",
      "NASA on Tuesday announced an overhaul to its plan to collect samples from Mars and return them to Earth.",
      "Agency officials said they have decided to scrap parts of their original plan to cut down on the mission\u2019s technical difficulty and cost and to shorten the timeline for when the samples could be brought back.",
      "Through its Mars Sample Return Program, NASA has for more than two decades been inching toward the goal of retrieving samples of Martian soil that NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover has been collecting since 2021. To do that, the agency had been working to develop multiple new spacecraft to relay the samples off the Martian surface and fly them back to Earth.",
      "NASA said in its announcement it is changing the plan for the spacecraft that will land on Mars to retrieve the samples and exploring two new, different options.",
      "One of the options is to attempt a style of landing similar to what NASA successfully executed with the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. As each rover made its descent, rockets were fired to slow the spacecraft, and an intricate sky crane then lowered them to the Martian surface.",
      "The second option would be to work with private space companies to send a new lander to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to pursue both possibilities in tandem before it makes a final decision about which to use in 2026.",
      "Space industry experts had speculated for months about the fate of the Mars Sample Return Program, which has fallen behind schedule as its budget has swelled.",
      "\u201cThe cost began to accelerate to the point that earlier this past year, it was thought that it could be as much as $11 billion, and you would not even get the samples back until 2040,\u201d NASA administrator Bill Nelson said at a news briefing Tuesday. \u201cThat was just simply unacceptable.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s original plan called for developing a \u201csample retrieval lander,\u201d which would have been equipped with two helicopters to retrieve the sealed sample tubes of rock, soil and atmosphere that Perseverance has collected and cached. The lander would also have carried a rocket to launch the samples off the Martian surface.",
      "Perseverance, which touched down in 2021, has been exploring a 28-mile-wide basin north of the Martian equator that scientists think was home to an ancient river delta.",
      "NASA's earlier plan called for the helicopters to gather the rover's samples, after which the lander\u2019s robotic arm would load them into the rocket. Then the rocket would blast off the Martian surface and jettison a capsule containing the samples while it was in orbit around the planet.",
      "After that would come yet another cosmic relay: The capsule would be intercepted by a spacecraft designed by the European Space Agency, and the precious cargo would begin a journey to Earth.",
      "The details of the design for a different lander and how it would gather the samples once it is on Mars are not yet clear. NASA said, however, that both of the new options involve a smaller rocket system to blast off the Martian surface.",
      "The two alternatives would still use the European-developed vehicle for the journey back to Earth.",
      "Nelson said the changes to NASA's plan could allow samples to arrive back on Earth as early as 2035, but he added that, depending on NASA funding, the timeline could extend to 2039.",
      "He said that the sky crane option would be likely to cost $6.6 billion to $7.7 billion and that the commercial route would be likely to cost $5.8 billion to $7.1 billion.",
      "NASA officials emphasized the importance of studying the samples.",
      "\u201cMars Sample Return will allow scientists to understand the planet\u2019s geological history and the evolution of climate on this barren planet where life may have existed in the past and shed light on the early solar system before life began here on Earth,\u201d Nicky Fox, head of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. \u201cThis will also prepare us to safely send the first human explorers to Mars.\u201d",
      "However, NASA has faced scrutiny in recent years over the cost and timing of several of its biggest programs, including the Mars Sample Return initiative and the Artemis return-to-the-moon program.",
      "The United States also faces increased competition from China, which has made rapid advancements in its space program over the past decade. Last year, China became the first country to collect and\u00a0return samples from the far side of the moon, and Chinese officials have said they intend to launch a mission to retrieve samples from Mars and return them to Earth by around 2031.",
      "Nelson, however, said that NASA\u2019s plan is more intricate than what Chinese officials have spoken about publicly and that the U.S. program is centered on answering fundamental questions about Mars\u2019 history, rather than being driven by a space race.",
      "\u201cYou cannot compare the two missions,\u201d he said. \u201cWill people say that there\u2019s a race? Well, of course people will say that. But it\u2019s two totally different missions.\u201d"

      "Yarrow died in New York City with loved ones by his side, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to NBC News.",
      "Daughter Bethany Yarrow said in a statement: \u201cOur fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life.

      "Mary Travers, 72, died in 2009, leaving Noel Paul Stookey, 87, as the last surviving member of Peter, Paul and Mary.",
      "The trio's songs were part of the soundtrack for the Civil Rights and anti-Vietnam War movements. Yarrow co-wrote the group\u2019s most enduring song, \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon,\u201d based on a poem by the late Lenny Lipton.",
      "The trio joined other notable acts of the time, including Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, at the\u00a01963 March on Washington\u00a0when Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.",
      "They went to Washington that day at the invitation of Harry Belafonte.",
      "\"At the time, the country was saying a pledge of allegiance, 'With liberty and justice for all,' but it was fatuous because it wasn\u2019t for all,\" Yarrow would say years later.",
      "\"People of color did not have justice. They did not have freedom. They couldn't vote. In Washington, D.C., if you were a person of color, you couldn't use a public bathroom. You couldn't use the water fountain unless it said, 'For colored only.' So when Peter, Paul and Mary were approached by Harry Belafonte, we, of course, said yes. We were well prepared to sing what we sang.\"",
      "Other hits by the trio included \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" \"Lemon Tree\" and \"Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right.\u201d",
      "Stookey said that growing up as an only child, he never knew what it was like to have a brother until he met Yarrow. They were best men at each other's weddings.",
      "\"He was a loving \u2018uncle\u2019 to my three daughters.\u00a0And, while his comfort in the city and my love of the country tended to keep us apart geographically,\u00a0our different perspectives were celebrated often in our friendship and our music,\" Stookey said in a statement.",
      "\"I was five months older than Peter \u2014 who became my creative, irrepressible, spontaneous and musical younger brother \u2014 yet at the same time, I grew to be grateful for, and to love, the mature-beyond-his-years wisdom and inspiring guidance he shared with me like an older brother.\u00a0Politically astute and emotionally vulnerable, perhaps Peter was both of the brothers I never had ... and I shall deeply miss both of him.\"",
      "Yarrow kept a relatively low profile later in life after he was convicted in 1970 of molesting a 14-year-old girl in a Washington, D.C., hotel room in 1969.",
      "He spent three months behind bars and was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter just before his term ended in 1981.",
      "The assault permanently stained Yarrow's reputation, particularly in the #MeToo era, as he was regularly disinvited from events once his name became known as a performing guest.",
      "Yarrow didn't dispute his acts.",
      "\u201cI fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\u201d Yarrow said in a statement to The New York Times after invitation to a 2019 festival in Binghamton, New York, was withdrawn.",

      "\"Driven by a deep belief that a more compassionate and respectful world is possible, my father has lived a cause driven life full of love and purpose,\" Bethany Yarrow said. \"He always believed, with his whole heart, that singing together could change the world.

      "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The driver charged with killing NHL hockey player Johnny Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, as they cycled on a rural New Jersey road pleaded not guilty to the indictment Tuesday after turning down a prosecution offer of 35 years in prison.",
      "Sean M. Higgins, 44, appeared briefly in court in Salem County, New Jersey, and entered a formal plea to the recent indictment in the Aug. 29 deaths. The case will now move toward trial.",
      "Defense lawyers, in a statement, said they hope to prove that the deaths stemmed not from any \u201cmalfeasance\u201d but from \u201ca combination of uniquely unfortunate circumstances unlikely to ever occur again.\u201d",
      "They described Higgins as a combat veteran who has faith in the legal system.",
      "Prosecutors say the married father of two \u2014 who worked for an addiction treatment company \u2014 had a history of road rage and was impaired that day after drinking five or six beers. He said he had been driving around for two hours, sometimes talking by phone with a friend, after an upsetting conversation with his mother.",
      "Johnny Gaudreau, 31, and Matthew Gaudreau, 29, were killed near their childhood home in South Jersey on the eve of their sister\u2019s wedding.",
      "A driver in front of Higgins told police that he had been driving aggressively. When she and another driver slowed down and moved left to go around the cyclists, Higgins sped up and veered right, striking the Gaudreaus, she said.",
      "Higgins had a blood-alcohol level of .087, which is above the state\u2019s .08 legal limit, and failed a field sobriety test, police said.",
      "He is being held on charges that include two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and vehicular homicide, along with evidence tampering and leaving the scene of an accident.",
      "Defense lawyer Matthew Portella has called Higgins a loving father and a good person who \u201cmade a horrible decision that night.\u201d",
      "Both Portella and county prosecutors confirmed the terms of the proposed deal.",
      "Johnny Gaudreau, known as \u201cJohnny Hockey,\u201d played 10 full seasons in the NHL and was set to start his third with the Columbus Blue Jackets. He played his first eight seasons with the Calgary Flames."

    "story": [
      "A lawsuit against famed boxing promoter Don King seeks more than $3 billion, alleging King falsely denied being involved in an anniversary event for his historic \"Rumble in the Jungle.\"",
      "BYD Sports and BYD Management, two limited liability companies, filed the complaint in federal court against King, 93, last month, alleging defamation, tortious interference and fraud.",
      "According to the complaint, BYD CEO Cecil Miller alleges he was working with King for more than a year on a \"Rumble in the Jungle 2\" before Don King Productions issued a cease-and-desist letter claiming no affiliation with the event.",
      "Don King Productions did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An attorney for King or the company is not listed in the court record.",
      "The \"Rumble in the Jungle\" is King's most famous events, a 1974 matchup between legendary boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Africa. The event took place in Zaire, which is now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that BYD had worked with Don King Productions on various events beginning in 2021 and that King had spoken to Miller about his intention to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the match. Miller believed King needed help coordinating \"Rumble in the Jungle 2,\" and BYD sent a proposal on the matter in August 2023, the suit says.",
      "\"Although the receipt was acknowledged by DKP\u2019s team, there has never been a written response to the proposal to date,\" the suit says.",
      "NBC News obtained a copy of a \"deal memorandum\" filed with the court documents.",
      "According to the suit, Miller and King continued to discuss the anniversary event in detail and Miller proposed Nigeria as a potential venue for the match.",
      "Miller alleges that at one point in May, he spoke to King about information that King's daughter was interested in holding a similar event and insisted that he would back out if King's daughter was handling it. The suit alleges that King told Miller at the time that his daughter \"had a bad history and was not to be trusted,\" as she previously misrepresented him.",
      "BYD continued to work on arrangements for \"Rumble in the Jungle 2,\" the suit says, but Don King Productions was \"avoiding all communications.\" The suit also alleges that King misrepresented his rights over the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" trademark in discussions about the matter.",
      "Don King Productions posted a cease-and-desist letter to its Facebook page on Nov. 1 addressed to BYD from an Ohio-based law firm. The letter said it had come to the attention of King and the production company that BYD was \"falsely representing\" to the Nigerian government that they had authorized the \"Rumble in the Jungle 2\" event.",
      "The lawsuit says that BYD had secured licenses for the event and that tickets were set to go on sale the day the cease-and-desist letter was posted. According to the suit, Miller got a call from King a few days before in which King said he had \"no idea\" what Miller was doing.",
      "Miller alleged that King gave his \"blessing\" for the event on video. One of the exhibits in the court records includes an image of King with the words \"it's go time and Don King cosigned.\" The image appears to be a screenshot of a video posted to BYD's verified Instagram account on Dec. 3, 2023, in which a man pans the camera to King and says \"we're going to get down to business\" and King smiles at the camera.",
      "There is no mention of \"Rumble in the Jungle 2\" in the video, and King does not say a word.",
      "Electronic summonses were issued to King and Don King Productions on Dec. 19 after, it appears, there were multiple filing errors in the request for summons.",
      "A judge also ordered BYD to refile its complaint in December, saying the suit fails to identify the plaintiffs' citizenship. An amended complaint was filed Dec. 18, but it failed to rectify the issue.",
      "A judge's order was issued last week to clarify the citizenship of the LLC members by Jan. 17 or risk the suit's dismissal, according to court records."

      "Minnesota resident Peter Nystrom saved for months to take his family on an unforgettable trip to the largest ski resort in America.",
      "But when his family of eight arrived at Park City Mountain Resort in Utah recently, the getaway quickly soured because of a union strike that led to three-hour wait times for ski lifts and unsafe conditions.",
      "\u201cWe thought it\u2019d be a fun kind of Christmas gift, to go do this kind of once-in-a lifetime ski trip,\u201d Nystrom told NBC News after spending more than $20,000 on airfare, food and lodging for his wife, four boys and in-laws.",
      "Nystrom and hundreds of other winter guests have been stuck in the middle of a workers\u2019 strike that began Dec. 27 by the Park City Professional Ski Patrol Association over pay and health benefits.",
      "\u201cThe really frustrating part was just the lack of transparency,\u201d Nystrom said, adding he didn't receive notice about the ongoing dispute before his trip. \u201cWe got to the resort, and that\u2019s when we found out there\u2019s a strike happening.\u201d",
      "Although skiing at Park City is expensive, \u201cwe wanted to experience some real mountains,\u201d he said. A day pass at Park City during his trip cost $288.",
      "Vail Resorts, which owns the Park City resort, and the union, which represents 200 workers, resumed mediation Tuesday as the ski area continued to operate at a limited capacity.",
      "Union workers are asking for a wage increase to $23 an hour, from $21, and better health benefits, union board member Quinn Graves told NBC News.",
      "Members of the ski patrol conduct mountain safety, such as avalanche mitigation, and respond to medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe feel that\u2019s very fair, to just ask for wages to keep in step with inflation,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThe overarching goal is to secure a wage and benefit package that allows members, our unit members, to thrive.\u201d",
      "Negotiations began eight months ago, she said.",
      "Vail Resorts said in a statement Tuesday that patrol wages have increased more than 50% over the past four seasons, \"far outpacing inflation.\"",
      "The resort disputes the amount the union is asking for, saying the ski patrol association wants $7 an hour more, not $2.",
      "Chief Operating Officer Deirdra Walsh apologized in a statement Monday for Park City Mountain not being fully operational and said 51 additional trails have opened since the strike began.",
      "It did not say how many were already open before the 51 were added, but the resort has a total of 350 trails.",
      "\u201cThis was not the holiday skiing and riding experience anyone wanted, and we know that,\u201d Walsh said in the statement. \u201cI want to apologize to everyone that we haven\u2019t been able to open the terrain we had hoped for by now, and that the long wait times were longer than usual during the peak holiday. Nobody wins in a strike.\u201d",
      "At Park City, that includes vacationers who are leaving the renowned resort frustrated and feeling like their money was wasted.",
      "\u201cThis is our first and probably only trip to Utah,\u201d said Mike Evans, who lives in New York and planned his trip for months.",
      "He spent thousands of dollars and he and his family traveled 12,000 miles so they could have a memorable ski trip, he told NBC News affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City.",
      "Evans rode the lifts only four times because of the 90-minute waits and lines as long as 1,000 people.",
      "\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d he said.",
      "Nystrom said he wants the strike over as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cI would highly implore the resorts to figure out a solution here to work with the union,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The chief executive of U.S. Steel appealed directly to President-elect Donald Trump to take a second look at a Japanese company\u2019s $15 billion deal to buy the American steelmaker.",
      "President Joe Biden blocked the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday, citing national security concerns after a key business-review panel failed to reach a consensus on whether the acquisition posed any risks. Both companies sued the administration over the decision.",
      "Trump has also opposed Nippon\u2019s purchase of the once-iconic Pittsburgh-based firm and again questioned the proposed sale Monday. But U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt told CNBC on Tuesday that he believes he can appeal to Trump\u2019s business sensibilities.",
      "\u201cWe have a new president that will take a fresh look at this. We understand what his current views are, but he\u2019s a smart guy,\u201d Burritt said.",
      "He added that he hopes Trump will \u201csee how this helps make U.S. Steel great again. And frankly, Nippon is going to pay for it,\u201d he said, echoing Trump\u2019s frequent assertions during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for a wall along the U.S. southern border, which never came to pass.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump referred to his earlier comments on the matter. A White House spokesperson reiterated a statement provided to NBC News on Monday night: \u201cPresident Biden will never hesitate to protect the security of this nation, its infrastructure, and the resilience of its supply chains.\u201d",
      "Since Trump won the election, a deluge of business leaders have visited his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as they seek to win favor with the incoming administration, among them Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Trump's inaugural committee has also received millions in donations from Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, Uber, Meta and some of their executives personally.",
      "Twenty mayors and community leaders in Pennsylvania and Indiana called on Biden to approve the deal in a letter late last month. On the opposite side, the United Steelworkers International union repeatedly pressed Biden to block the deal. It said last week said it had \"no doubt that it's the right move for our members and our national security,\" and it praised Biden's decision Friday.",
      "Burritt said any potential national security concerns about the agreement could be \u201ceasily mitigated.\u201d He said Biden had \u201ctainted\u201d the process by making it clear since the deal was announced that he would side with unions and didn't allow the review to \u201cplay out as it is supposed to.\u201d",
      "Burritt, the U.S. Steel chief, also dismissed Biden\u2019s concerns that the company needed to remain American-owned and -operated for national security and supply chain reasons. \u201cIn fact, it strengthens national security, it strengthens economic security, it strengthens job security. In fact, it grows the business,\u201d he said.",
      "Burritt declined to speculate on what would happen to U.S. Steel if the company\u2019s lawsuits or the incoming administration don\u2019t change the outcome. \u201cNobody in the integrated mill space is better than Nippon, and they\u2019re going to do great things for the workers here in Pennsylvania, in Indiana and all the places we do business.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel has said there is \u201cno reason to need to give up\u201d on its deal. \u201cThis is not just the most important matter for our company\u2019s business strategy. I am firmly convinced this is something extremely beneficial for both Japan and the United States,\u201d its chairman and CEO told reporters Tuesday.",

    "summary": "The U.S. will begin rolling out a program to label certain internet-connected products as meeting a basic cybersecurity standard.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. will begin rolling out a program to label certain internet-connected products as meeting a basic cybersecurity standard, a White House official said Tuesday.",
      "Called the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, the initiative is comparable to the \u201cEnergy Star\u201c program, and will label products like baby monitors, fitness trackers and security cameras that have passed a U.S. cybersecurity audit. Products that qualify can legally display the mark on advertising and packaging. The program does not apply to computers or smartphones.",
      "In a call with reporters Tuesday about the program, Anne Neuberger, the White House\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity and emerging technology, said that she expects \u201cthere will be labeled products on the shelves in 2025.\u201d",
      "Internet of things devices \u2014 products ranging from Televisions to refrigerators that are connected to the internet \u2014 are frequently hacked, often without their owners even knowing it, and can be used to help power cybercriminal networks. In recent years, the FBI has occasionally gotten legal permission to boot malicious software from home routers that had been hacked in mass campaigns.",
      "The Biden administration, which has seen multiple massive hacking campaigns aimed at Americans and the federal government, has introduced several cybersecurity regulations, but those have faced opposition from courts and businesses. The Cyber Trust Mark program is voluntary, and is designed to persuade the tech market to sell safer products.",
      "\u201cAmericans buying home alarm systems and baby monitors need to know hackers can\u2019t disable the alarm system remotely or hack in to watch their babies asleep. Companies need to have an incentive to bake security into products, and the U.S. government wants to give American consumers that confidence,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "\u201cWe know consumers want secure devices. They don\u2019t know how to ask for it. They don\u2019t know how to assess it. So by giving this label, we feel consumers now can say, \u2018I know how to get a secure device,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Several large electronics retailers, including Best Buy and Amazon, have endorsed the move, according to a White House press release.",
      "While no company can guarantee its devices will never be hacked, there is a wide range of protections that can be built into a product to make it a more difficult target. Companies looking to display the mark can petition to have their products audited by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which will determine, for example, whether they should encourage customers to choose a strong password or automatically start with the same default password for every product.",
      "The program is overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, which began designing it in 2023.",
      "In its waning days, the Biden administration is also working to finalize an executive order forcing federal agencies to only use products that have qualified for the Cyber Trust Mark starting in 2027, Neuberger said."

    "title": "Federal prosecutors say they've uncovered 'additional criminal conduct' by NYC Mayor Eric Adams",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 02:40:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors allege they have uncovered \u201cadditional criminal conduct\u201d by New York Mayor Eric Adams ahead of his scheduled trial in April.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors allege they have uncovered \u201cadditional criminal conduct\u201d by New York Mayor Eric Adams ahead of his scheduled trial in April.",
      "Adams, 64, was charged in September with five criminal counts, including bribery, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national.",
      "In court documents filed Monday, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said that \u201claw enforcement has continued to identify additional individuals involved in Adams\u2019s conduct, and to uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams,\u201d as part of the ongoing investigation.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, Adams criticized the investigation.",
      "\u201cEven Ray Charles can see what\u2019s going on,\" Adams said, referring to the late artist, who was blind. \"And I have an attorney, Alex Spiro, who is handling that. I\u2019ve said over and over again: I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Spiro slammed the government's latest filing, saying that \"this is amateur hour\" and accusing prosecutors of \"just looking for a headline instead of doing the right thing.\"",
      "The prosecutors' filing was in response to Adams\u2019 request for a bill of particulars, meaning more details about the charges and why he is being accused.",
      "The government pushed back against his request, arguing that revealing a list of alleged co-conspirators \u201cwould prejudice the ongoing investigation\u201d and could lead to potential witness tampering.",
      "\u201cThe Indictment provides ample cause to believe that as potential witnesses became known to Adams and his allies, measures were taken to influence their testimony,\u201d prosecutors said in Monday's filing, citing the initial indictment. \u201cAnd even without a likelihood of physical violence, the threat of witness tampering further supports denial of a bill of particulars in a white-collar case.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors didn\u2019t include details about the allegations of additional criminal conduct or others involved in Monday's filing.",
      "However, the government said at a court hearing in October that additional charges against Adams were \u201cpossible\u201d and that it was \u201clikely\u201d that additional defendants would be charged in the corruption case.",
      "Adams, a New York City police captain, has pleaded not guilty. He is the first sitting New York City mayor to be indicted on criminal charges in the modern era."

    "story": [
      "The soldier who authorities believe blew up a Cybertruck on New Year's Day in front of the entrance of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas used artificial intelligence to guide him about how to set off the explosion, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, queried ChatGPT for information about how he could put together an explosive, how fast a round would need to be fired for the explosives found in the truck to go off \u2014 not just catch fire \u2014 and what laws he would need to get around to get the materials, law enforcement officials said.",
      "\u201cWe know AI was going to change the game for all of us at some point or another, in really all of our lives,\u201d Clark County/Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. \u201cI think this is the first incident that I\u2019m aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas police identified Livelsberger last week as the suspect behind the blast. The Clark County coroner determined that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, police said.",
      "Authorities said they were able to identify his badly burned body through various means, including family DNA and tattoos.",
      "On Tuesday, law enforcement officials showed video of Livelsberger pulling a can of what they said was racing fuel from the back of the Cybertruck and dousing the vehicle in the part of it containing explosives.",
      "Kenny Cooper, assistant special agent in charge of the San Francisco Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Livelsberger\u2019s self-inflicted gunshot might have caused the \u201cfuel air explosion\u201d by igniting the fireworks and other explosive materials in the vehicle.",
      "He said investigators haven\u2019t run into any purchase records or physical evidence from the scene that would indicate that Livelsberger used any type of remote-controlled detonation or sophisticated, timed-initiation system.",
      "A spokesperson for OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT, said in a statement that it was \u201csaddened\u201d by the revelation its technology was used to plot the attack.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened by this incident and committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOur models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson added that the company is aiding law enforcement with the investigation.",
      "The use of ChatGPT and other AI platforms is a rapidly growing concern for law enforcement officers, who worry about the potential for attackers to use the technology as a how-to guide.",
      "Law enforcement's challenges with AI were highlighted in an exclusive NBC News report that aired on \u201cHallie Jackson Now\u201d late last year.",
      "\"AI takes existing problems and magnifies them. It makes them at scale and at cost,\" Rebecca Weiner, New York City's deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, has told NBC News. \u201cThe technology makes it easier to do the concerning stuff.\u201d",
      "Asked Tuesday whether law enforcement agencies should have been aware of Livelsberger's queries of ChatGPT, McMahill said he didn't know whether the capability to track how someone uses artificial intelligence exists yet.",
      "Las Vegas and New York law enforcement officials have told NBC News that they don't yet have cooperation from AI services to get alerted when someone starts to ask what one would need to conduct an attack or build an explosive.",
      "Last week, authorities revealed that in an app found on one of two phones in the Cybertruck, Livelsberger criticized the U.S. government and appeared to acknowledge he blew up the vehicle on purpose.",
      "Two letters in the phone app suggest a possible motive, authorities said.\u00a0In one, he told \u201cfellow service members, veterans and all Americans\u201d it\u2019s time to \u201cwake up\u201d because the country\u2019s leadership is \u201cweak\u201d and \u201conly serves to enrich themselves.\u201d",
      "A second letter appeared to shed more light on Livelsberger\u2019s mentality. In it, he said that the explosion was \"not a terrorist attack\" and that Americans pay attention to only \"spectacles and violence.\"",
      "An additional, six-page \u201cmanifesto\u201d was found on his phone, officials said Tuesday.",
      "In the document, Livelsberger\u00a0laid out various grievances, including problems with the \u201ccurrent administration,\u201d officials said. He also wrote that graphic encounters from his military experiences replayed in his head in a loop and that he had nothing to live for, officials said.",
      "Livelsberger was on approved leave from the military when he rented the Tesla Cybertruck and drove from Colorado to Las Vegas, according to law enforcement officials. Fireworks and gas in the bed of the truck ignited after he parked it just outside the Trump hotel\u2019s entrance.",

      "Amanda Seyfried has starred in her fair share of dramatic roles, but had no idea that her distant relative's life was like something out of a soap opera.",
      "While appearing on the PBS series \"Finding Your Roots,\" the 39-year-old made some shocking discoveries about her family.",
      "With the help of the show's host, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Seyfried traced her ancestry back four generations and learned about a relative named John Peter Ebert who was born in Germany in 1844.",
      "After immigrating to the U.S., Ebert found work as a baker in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where Seyfried grew up. Ebert later married a woman named Amanda and started a family.",
      "\"He's created his own kingdom,\" Seyfried marveled in the episode that aired on Jan. 7.",
      "Sadly, Ebert's story doesn't have a happy ending. Seyfried's ancestor was shot and killed while leaving his home one day \u2014 a tragedy that was news to Seyfried.",
      "\"It\u2019s weird. I don't know him but he's family and I'm just like, 'How dare they!' Like, find justice,\" Seyfried said.",
      "The search for Ebert's killer became a major news story, dredging up Ebert's past. Police discovered that Ebert had fathered an illegitimate son named Herbert, who soon became a prime suspect.",
      "Ebert's widow Amanda reluctantly revealed that her late husband had previously had an affair with a woman named Mary who lived in a public home for the poor. Ebert met Mary while working in the public home as a baker. Allegedly, Ebert was then let go from his job. Unbeknownst to Ebert, Mary got pregnant and gave up their son for adoption. She went on to marry and kept her son's father's identity a secret.",
      "When Herbert's identity was made public following Ebert's death, he was able to provide an alibi. He told local police that he was under the impression that a man named Peter Ebert was his father, and that he had only met him once. When Herbert read in the newspaper that he was a suspect in Ebert's death, he realized he was his father.",
      "Seyfried described the story as a \"soap opera\" and said, \"These poor people.\"",
      "Reflecting on the effects this scandal must have had on Amanda and Mary, Seyfried described the situation as \"so twisted.\"",
      "\"To harbor that and know you have this kid out in the world. Horrible. Hard,\" the actor said. \"It's just gotta feel like a knife in the stomach being twisted every day.\"",
      "Eventually, police discovered that Ebert was shot by a neighbor in a failed robbery attempt. Looking back on her ancestor's infidelity and eventual fate, Seyfried offered the following reflections.",
      "\"He was a human. He made a mistake. He put some lives in turmoil and he had to make choices. He had a lot of kids and a business and he wanted to keep his life, and he made choices that ensured that his life would be saved. Selfish as that is, he was also protecting his kids so I can turn that story around. He didn't have to be shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Nobody deserved that,\" Gates said.",
      "The show's host traced Seyfried's family tree back seven more generations and discovered the name of her 10th great-great-grandfather: Simon Ebert. Knowing that she had such deep roots in one area dating back to the 16th century made Seyfried pause and reflect for a moment.",
      "\"It makes me feel very grounded, a part of something, I guess,\" she said."

      "The show did a bit of research, and it turns out Malhabor was more likely a naturalist than a physicist. He most likely arrived in the Philippines in the early 1870s when European naturalists visited the island on an exploratory mission. The show posited that Malhabor was among them.",
      "Gates' team found a baptism record for Malhabor's son that revealed Malhabor was from Prussia, a territory that included parts of Germany, Poland and Russia. More specifically, Malhabor likely came from modern day Germany. His wife, meanwhile, came Manila, the capital of the Philippines.",

      "After enlisting in the U.S. Navy, he worked in the boiler room of a ship.",
      "\u201cHe didn't see it as drudge work. He saw it as a way to better his own life,\u201d Salonga explained.",
      "The actor's grandfather was 47 years old when World War II broke out and had just been transferred back to Manila. Japanese forces had taken control of his homeland and massacres were common at the time. He was in particular danger since he was associated with the U.S. military.",
      "Salonga's grandfather went missing for some time at this point. Gates asked the star how she thought this may have impacted her own father, who was 12 at the time.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 15:11:22 GMT",
    "summary": "What happened to Jerry Springer? What did Jerry Springer die of? What did he say about his legacy?",
    "story": [
      "Fights. Racists. Adultery. Overall mayhem. \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show,\u201d which aired nearly 4,000 episodes between 1991 and 2018, was home to all four. Yet at its center, host Jerry Springer (who died in 2023) was an ocean of calm wading through a sea of muck and controversy.",
      "\u201cJerry was warm and charismatic and empathetic and he did care about people but you certainly wouldn\u2019t know it from the show that bore his name,\u201d former Chicago media critic Robert Feder, who is interviewed in a new Netflix documentary, \u201cJerry Springer: Fights, Camera, Action,\u201d tells TODAY.com. \u201cHe made it acceptable for people to watch the show and consider everything that they were being exposed to as entertainment.\u201d",
      "How did the lawyer, politician and Emmy-winning news reporter become the so-called King of Trash TV? Here's what we know about the man who believed he \u201cruined the culture\u201d with his program.",
      "What was Jerry Springer\u2019s early career like?",
      "The UK-born son of German Jewish refugees, Springer actually came into the world in a subway station while his mother sheltered from German bombs during World War II, as NBC News reported in 2023. After his family immigrated to New York City when he was young, he went on to earn a law degree and join the advisory team to Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.",
      "Springer settled in Ohio and won a seat on the Cincinnati city council when he was just 27 in 1971. But he resigned in 1974 after paying for a sex worker with a check, which he confessed to in a public apology, as Cincinnati publication WCPO recalled.",
      "He got elected back to city council again a year later and in 1977 became Cincinnati\u2019s mayor. After a failed run at the Ohio governor\u2019s seat, he moved into TV by reporting on the news. As an anchor, he earned 10 local Emmy Awards, Cincinnati Magazine reported in 1992.",
      "\u201cThe Jerry Springer Show\u201d launched in 1991 taping out of Chicago. Early on the show focused on news and issues: Oliver North and Jesse Jackson were among early guest, and as WVXU wrote, topics included \u201chomelessness, AIDS, domestic violence, race and equality.\u201d",
      "But when ratings tumbled, the show hired former tabloid newsman Richard Dominick and the series evolved into the chair-throwing, headline-grabbing, chaotic beast that would ultimately topple \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d in the ratings, running for decades.",
      "\u201cHe was a man of enormous gifts and talents and potential, and it\u2019s sad that he squandered it,\u201d Feder tells TODAY.com. \u201cHe was a good guy, but he sold out and his name will forever be attached to the worst television show of all time.\u201d",
      "What did Jerry Springer say about his show \u2014 and its legacy?",
      "Springer spoke about \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show,\" its legacy and its effect on culture with a self-aware tone.",
      "And as he noted on \u201cThe Roseanne Show,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a country that watches my show, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t watch the show, but it\u2019s not aimed at 66-year-old men,\u201d Springer told the Associated Press, via TODAY, in 2010. \u201cIf I were in college, I would watch. I enjoy doing it. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Once the show was over, he was somewhat more forthcoming on its long-term ramifications. On the \u201cBehind the Velvet Rope\u201d podcast in 2022, Springer said, jokingly, \u201cI just apologize. I\u2019m so sorry. What have I done? I\u2019ve ruined the culture.\u201d",
      "What happened to Jerry Springer?",
      "\u201cJerry loved being a star,\u201d Dominick says in the documentary.",
      "After his show went off the air in 2018, Springer made efforts to remain in the public eye. He launched a courtroom show in 2019 called \u201cJudge Jerry\u201d that lasted for three seasons. He continued to host shows like \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d \u201cWWE Raw\u201d and a dating program called \u201cBaggage.\u201d He also dipped his toe into acting, including starring in a 1998 film called \u201cRingmaster\u201d playing a character loosely based on himself.",
      "He also competed on \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d in 2022 and danced on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d in 2006 \u2014 in part so he could learn to waltz for his daughter\u2019s wedding.",
      "Springer died in April, 2023 at age 79, TODAY reported. A family spokesperson said he had a recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",
      "\u201cJerry\u2019s ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried, whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word,\u201d family spokesperson and his longtime friend Jean Galvin said.ruin"

      "Demi Moore provided one of the highlights of the evening when she won best actress in a motion picture (musical or comedy) for her role in \u201cThe Substance\u201d at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 5.",
      "Moore, 62, may have won for her work in the film, but she\u2019s being cheered on equally for her passionate and moving acceptance speech, in which she acknowledged how far she had come in her career.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just in shock right now. I\u2019ve been doing this a long time \u2014 like, over 45 years \u2014 and this is the first time I\u2019ve ever won anything as an actor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just so humbled and so grateful.",
      "\u201cThirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress. At that time, I made that mean that this wasn\u2019t something that I was allowed to have. That I could do movies that were successful and made a lot of money, but that I couldn\u2019t be acknowledged and I bought in, and I believed that,\u201d she said referring to her Golden Globe win.",
      "\u201cThat corroded me over time, to the point where I thought a few years ago that maybe this was it. Maybe I was complete, maybe I\u2019d done what I was supposed to do.\u201d",
      "She then said that\u2019s when \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a film in which she plays an aging Hollywood star who takes a drug that creates a younger version of herself, came to her attention.",
      "\u201cAnd as I was at kind of a low point, I had this magical, bold, courageous, out-of-the-box, absolutely bonkers script come across my desk called \u2018The Substance,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the universe told me, \u2018You\u2019re not done.\u2019\u201d",
      "Moore, whose family may have been even more excited by her win than she was, also thanked \u201call of the people who stood by me, especially the people who believed in me when I haven\u2019t believed in myself.\u201d",
      "She then wrapped up her speech by reminding people about one of the messages the film tries to impart.",
      "\u201cIn those moments when we don\u2019t think we\u2019re smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough or basically just not enough, I had a woman say to me, \u2018Just know you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAnd so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me and for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.\u201d",
      "Moore's words hit viewers on hard, with some sharing their thoughts on X.",
      "\"After this speech\u2026 give Demi Moore all the awards,\" one person wrote.",
      "\"Woah! Demi Moore\u2019s speech just blew me away!\" someone else raved. \"I need to see her in more serious roles, she\u2019s fantastic and I\u2019m so happy for her.\"",
      "\"Most beautiful speech of the night,\" another person commented.",
      "\"Demi Moore just gave the best speech of the night,\" someone else wrote."

I respect him so much creatively. I have so much trust in him. Of course, I want him to be my director or my scene partner.\u201d"

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that he wants Canada to join the United States have become a staple of his presidential transition. But the sentiment \u2014 like Trump\u2019s breezy confidence about its ease and popularity \u2014 is far from new.",
      "Such talk has sprung up practically throughout the whole of American history, often buttressed by the idea that Canadians were clamoring for it, too.",
      "Amid the War of 1812, President Thomas Jefferson told Philadelphia newspaper editor Thomas Duane that \u201cthe acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching.\u201d (Spoiler alert: It wasn\u2019t.) Among other things, the National Park Service notes in an article about the comment, many in the United States wrongly \u201cassumed that the Canadian population would welcome the arrival of American forces.\u201d",
      "Later in the 1800s, a degree of pro-annexation sentiment developed within each of the major U.S. political parties, according to historian John W. Quist, united by a common thread that annexation of Canada \u201cwould occur peacefully and be welcomed by Canadians.\u201d",
      "And now there\u2019s Trump, posting on social media that \u201cmany people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, he continued the drumbeat at a news conference, telling reporters he could use \u201ceconomic force\u201d to acquire Canada. \u201cThat would really be something,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cYou get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like. And it would also be much better for national security.\u201d",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said afterward on X: \"There isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\"",
      "Public opinion polling of Canada illustrates a distinct political culture that\u2019s far different from the United States.\u2019",
      "A September poll from the Environics Institute showed Canadians preferring Vice President Kamala Harris to Trump by a 3-to-1 ratio before the election, though Trump fared better than Joe Biden in the same measure four years ago, especially among younger Canadians. (The poll did show a plurality of Canadian Conservatives preferring him this time, which was not the case in 2020.)",
      "Canadians generally have had favorable opinions about the United States over the last quarter-century, according to Pew Research Center surveys \u2014 but they were never lower than when Trump was president, dipping to 35% favorable in 2020 before they rebounded after Biden\u2019s election. The Environics Institute\u2019s polling shows a similar trend.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of Canadian politicians and parties supporting annexation by the United States have sprung up over the years \u2014 but those movements have quickly evaporated without gaining much more than a whisper of public support.",
      "And as Montreal Gazette columnist Allison Haines noted in 2018 in writing about one of those quixotic endeavors, the likes of Quebec \u201cwould be a very odd fit as the 51st state,\u201d with approval for things like universal health care deeply embedded in Canadian political culture (though some polls have shown rising interest in reform in Canada) while they remain hot-button issues of debate in the United States.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that the last time the idea of adding new states was in the public sphere, then-Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others in the GOP were quick to warn about the potential political consequences of adding more Democratic senators. The Environics Institute poll, translated into hypothetical votes, would add millions of anti-Trump voters to the country.",
      "In short, Trump\u2019s rhetorical dreams of a no-brainer match are far more complicated in reality. But he is not alone in U.S. history in skating past those trivialities to talk of new frontiers in manifest destiny."

      "TOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker said Tuesday that it would not give up trying to buy U.S. Steel even after President Joe Biden blocked the $15 billion bid last week over national security concerns.",
      "Blocking Nippon Steel\u2019s proposed deal cast a shadow over outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s final visit to Japan amid worries that it could sour U.S. relations with a key diplomatic and economic Asian ally \u2014 the two countries are each other's biggest foreign investors.",
      "Eiji Hashimoto, chairman and CEO of Nippon Steel, the world\u2019s fourth-largest steelmaker, said there was \u201cno reason or need to give up\u201d on the bid.",
      "\u201cThis is not just the most important matter for our company\u2019s business strategy,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo. \u201cI am firmly convinced this is something extremely beneficial for both Japan and the United States.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which strongly supports the deal, sued the Biden administration and others over the decision Monday, saying Biden ignored the rule of law to gain political favor with union members who opposed it.",
      "\u201cNever before has a President prohibited an acquisition by a company based in Japan, one of our closest allies,\u201d they said in the lawsuit.",
      "After he met Tuesday with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Blinken said the U.S.-Japan alliance was \u201cstronger than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d He did not answer a question from NBC News about the Nippon Steel bid.",
      "The decision was left up to the White House last month after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government panel that reviews foreign investments for national security risks, failed to reach consensus. In announcing his decision to block it Friday, Biden said it was important to keep U.S. Steel American-owned to avoid undermining critical supply chains and putting jobs at risk.",
      "\u201cA committee of national security and trade experts determined this acquisition would create risk for American national security,\u201d White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said in a statement Monday in response to the lawsuit. \u201cPresident Biden will never hesitate to protect the security of this nation, its infrastructure, and the resilience of its supply chains.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said Tuesday its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.",
      "The North Korean state media report came a day after South Korea\u2019s military said it detected North Korea launching a missile that flew 685 miles before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launch, conducted weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president, came off a torrid year in weapons testing.",
      "North Korea demonstrated multiple weapons systems last year that can target its neighbors and the United States, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and there are concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine.",
      "North Korea in recent years has flight tested various intermediate-range missiles, which if perfected, could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam. In recent months, the North has been testing combining these missiles with purported hypersonic warheads to improve their survivability.",
      "North Korea since 2021 has been testing various hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons aim to withstand regional missile defense systems. However, it\u2019s unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims.",
      "The North\u2019s state media said Kim supervised Monday\u2019s launch, and that the weapon traveled 932 miles), during which it reached two different peaks of 62 miles and 26.4 miles and achieved a speed amounting to 12 times the speed of sound, before accurately striking a sea target.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military believes North Korea was exaggerating capabilities of the system, saying the missile covered less distance and that there was no second peak.",
      "Lee said the test was most likely a follow-up to another hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile test last April and said it would be difficult to use such systems in a relatively small territory like the Korean Peninsula. He said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were continuing to analyze the missile.",
      "Kim described the missile as a crucial achievement in his goals to bolster the North\u2019s nuclear deterrence by building an arsenal \u201cno one can respond to,\u201d according to the official Korean Central News Agency.",
      "\u201cThe hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,\u201d the agency quoted Kim as saying.",
      "Kim reiterated that his nuclear push was aimed at countering \u201cdifferent security threats the hostile forces posed to our state,\u201d but KCNA didn\u2019t mention any direct criticism toward Washington, Seoul or Tokyo.",
      "The launch took place while Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues.",
      "In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Monday, Blinken condemned North Korea\u2019s launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North\u2019s weapons programs. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. He described the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a \u201ctwo-way street,\u201d saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and \u201cintends to share space and satellite technology.\u201d",
      "According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow\u2019s war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by Kim\u2019s nuclear-armed military.",
      "At a year-end political conference, Kim Jong Un vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a \u201cnuclear military bloc for aggression.\u201d",
      "North Korean state media did not specify Kim\u2019s policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim\u2019s strengthened position \u2014 built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions \u2014 presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon said Monday it had transferred 11 Yemeni men to Oman this week after holding them for more than two decades without charge at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
      "The transfer was the latest and biggest\u00a0push by the Biden administration\u00a0in its final weeks to clear Guantanamo of the last remaining detainees there who were never charged with a crime.",
      "The latest release brings the total number of men detained at Guantanamo to 15. That\u2019s the fewest since 2002, when President George W. Bush\u2019s administration turned Guantanamo into a detention site for the mostly Muslim men taken into custody around the world in what the U.S. called its \u201cwar on terror.\u201d The U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and military and covert operations elsewhere followed the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks.",
      "The men in the latest transfer included Shaqawi al Hajj, who had undergone repeated hunger strikes and hospitalizations at Guantanamo to protest his 21 years in prison, preceded by two years of detention and torture in CIA custody, according to the U.S.-based Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "Rights groups and some lawmakers have pushed successive U.S. administrations to close Guantanamo or, failing that, release all those detainees never charged with a crime. Guantanamo held about 800 detainees at its peak.",
      "The Biden administration and administrations before it said they were working on lining up suitable countries willing to take those never-charged detainees. Many of those stuck at Guantanamo were from Yemen, a country split by war, with its capital held by the Iranian-allied Houthi militant group.",
      "The sultanate of Oman, on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, did not acknowledge taking in the prisoners early Tuesday. Officials in the country did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. The key Western ally has taken in some 30 prisoners in the past since the founding of the prison.",
      "However, those prisoners have since been released in circumstances unexplained by Oman.\u00a0Two Afghans once held by Oman returned to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in February. One Yemeni died in Oman after being told he and 27 others would be repatriated to Yemen, the British activist group CAGE International said.",
      "\u201cFaced with little choice, 26 of the men and their families returned to Yemen after being pressured by the Omani government, which offered each $70,000 as compensation,\u201d the group said. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what happened to the 28th prisoner.",
      "The transfer announced Monday leaves six never-charged men still being held at Guantanamo, two convicted and sentenced inmates, and seven others charged with the 2001 attacks, the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, and 2002 bombings in Bali, Indonesia."
